The aim has been to lay the foundations for nitrogen-related laboratory research on p.f. flames of practical interest. The work has included both measurements and mathematical modelling. The experiments were conducted in both small-scale turbulent coal flames and large-scale laboratory flames (0.5 MW). The emphasis has been three-fold: 1. (1) Study of the initial stages of the devolatilization, nitrogen release and subsequent nitric oxide formation from pulverized coal particles injected into a bench-top turbulent flat flame; 2. (2) Identification of the combustion aerodynamic conditions in a large-scale pulverized-coal-fired laboratory furnace which favour reduced NO formation/emission, and determination of formation mechanisms of nitrogen oxides. To this end, measurements were made on two aerodynamically distinct industrial-type burners to assess the effect of furnace operating conditions and coal particle size distribution on NO formation and emission. Detailed in-flame measurements of nitrogen oxides, intermediate nitrogenous species, major gas species, gas temperature and particle composition were undertaken. 3. (3) Development and validation of an NO post-processor coupled to a 2D mathematical model (FAFNIR) of pulverized coal combustion. The NO post-processor is based on available empirically based, simplified kinetic schemes. The modelling encompasses the separate contributions to fuel-NO formation of the volatiles and the char as well as NO reduction by the char. The most significant conclusions to date include the following: 1. (1) A low-NOx burner has been developed, based on the knowledge gained on the effect of particle trajectories in the near-burner region on NO formation and reduction, which can successfully reduce NO emissions from 600 to 280 vpm without affecting flame stability and combustion efficiency; 2. (2) N2O survives in the fuel-rich region where HCN, NH3, and NO are present. There is no evidence of a post-flame N2O formation 'window' between 877 and 1227 °C as suggested in some earlier studies; 3. (3) The NO predictions are generally in good agreement with a wide range of experimental data, except for the near-burner region of the low-NOx burner, where the model somewhat over-predicts the combustion reactions. This deficiency in the parent code, which appears to be shared by all other codes, is due to the poor predictions of the gas temperature and oxygen concentrations in the near-burner region. © 1994.","emission control; nitrogen oxides; pulverized coal combustion","Aerodynamics; Air pollution control; Combustion; Composition; Gas emissions; Measurements; Particle size analysis; Particles (particulate matter); Pulverized fuel; Reduction; Vaporization; Coal particle size distribution; Combustion efficiency; Devolatilization; Emission control; Flame stability; Gas temperature; Nitric oxide formation; Nitrogen oxide reduction; Oxygen concentration; Pulverized coal flames; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028501119

Disruption of the yeast gene severely impaired mitochondrial function, while Northern analysis showed it to be subject to catabolite repression. Deletion analysis of the CYB3 promoter identified a single HAP2/3/4-binding element that is necessary and sufficient for carbon source-dependent transcriptional regulation. These experiments also suggested the presence of additional, as yet unidentified, transcriptional control elements, both negative and positive.

The AVHRR spectra channels were selected based on regions that are strongly transparent to clear sky conditions and are therefore useful for characterizing both surface and cloud-top conditions. The ERBE instruments make broadband observations that are important for climate studies.

Ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa. Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesü) and blue spruce Picea pun—gens. growing in full sunlight was found to differ between the summer and the winter, with higher levels of lutein and the carotenoids of the xanthophyll cycle and lower levels of α‐carotene being present during the winter. In addition, the extent of the de‐epoxidation of violaxunthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin at midday was greater during the winter than during the summer. The latter two carotenoids were also found to be retained at high levels overnight on cold days during the winter. Associated with the retention of antheraxanlhin and zeaxanthin were sustained depressions of photosystem II (PSII) efficiency. These decreases in photo system II efficiency were accompanied by changes in chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics that are indicative of increased levels of energy dissipation in the chlorophyll pigment bed. Sustained depressions in PSII efficiency are commonly interpreted as “photoinhibitton”. We therefore suggest that low temperature‐induced photo inhibition in these conifers during the winter was due to a down regulation of photosystem II that involved sustained xanthophyll cycle‐associated energy dissipation. Furthermore, the predawn conversion state of the xanthophyll cycle responded rapidly to day to day variation in temperature. Being less epoxidized on colder days and more epoxidized on both previous and subsequent warmer days. Such flexibility in the response of the santhophyll cycle to changes in temperature may be important in the regulation and protection of the photosynthetic apparatus of such evergreen plants in a climate that experiences relatively rapid changes in temperature.

The objectives of the model are to investigate linkages and feedbacks in the system, and to evaluate consequences of climate policies. Dynamic calculations are performed to year 2100, with a spatial scale ranging from grid (0.5°×0.5° latitudelongitude) to world regional level, depending on the sub-model. The model consists of three fully linked sub-systems: Energy-Industry, Terrestrial Environment, and Atmosphere-Ocean. The Energy-Industry models compute the emissions of greenhouse gases in 13 world regions as a function of energy consumption and industrial production. End use energy consumption is computed from various economic/demographic driving forces. The Terrestrial Environment models simulate the changes in global land cover on a gridscale based on climatic and economic factors, and the flux of CO2 and other greenhouse gases from the biosphere to the atmosphere. The Atmosphere-Ocean models compute the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the resulting zonal-average temperature and precipitation patterns. The fully linked model has been tested against data from 1970 to 1990, and after calibration can reproduce the following observed trends: regional energy consumption and energy-related emissions, terrestrial flux of CO2 and emissions of greenhouse gases, concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and transformation of land cover.

The El emission spectra were recorded as a function of voltage, frequency, and temperature. The emission spectra at all temperatures show only strong sharp emission lines which were assigned to transitions within the 4f shell of Tm3+ ion. The emission spectra consisted of five groups of lines centered around 483 nm (1G4 → 3H6), 661.7 nm (1G4 →3H4), 710.5 nm (3F3→ 3He), 785 nm (1G4 →3H5), and 805.5 nm (3F4 →3H6). The emission intensities (I) of different peaks were recorded as a function of the applied voltage (V). The plot of natural logarithm of I vs. V-1/2 shows a straight line characteristic over many orders of emission intensity which indicates that the direct impact excitation mechanism is a dominant process.

The cells were classified according to their firing patterns during long (0.8-1 s) depolarizing current steps. Subthreshold voltage oscillations were revealed by depolarizing the membrane to voltages around threshold for action potentials; however, these were obvious mainly in cells showing marked spike adaptation. When neurons of all firing patterns were stimulated to fire at 40-60 Hz for tens of seconds, spikes abruptly inactivated. Hyperpolarizing the cells by 5-10 mV precipitated pronounced oscillations in 24 out of 35 cells. These oscillations existed in a narrow voltage range, and their frequency varied between 7 and 40 Hz, in a voltage-dependent manner. Spiking frequency was faster than the oscillation frequency for the same membrane potential in a given cell. The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin abolished both the spikes and the oscillations, and blockade of K+ channels by tetraethylammonium converted the oscillations into prolonged and irregular plateaus. Blocking Ca2+ conductance with Co2+ reduced the oscillations amplitude and frequency in two out of three cells. The oscillations that followed spike inactivation varied in amplitude, frequency and persistence among different cells. Layer 5 nonadapting cells possessed the most periodic oscillations, as judged by autocorrelation analysis. Oscillations were also most persistent in this group, maintaining a stable steady-state. In other cell types, the oscillations were less regular and decayed with time. There was no difference among cell groups in the maximal peak to peak amplitude of the oscillations, or their frequency range. It is suggested that the oscillations are generated by ionic conductances that operate within the voltage range just above and below spike threshold, and thus can shape the cells' firing pattern. The prominence of the oscillations in a specific subset of layer 5 cells may indicate the mechanism that underlies the rhythmic firing pattern of those cells. © 1994.",,"animal tissue; article; brain slice; controlled study; electrophysiology; intracellular recording; membrane potential; nerve cell excitability; nonhuman; oscillation; priority journal; rat; somatosensory cortex; Animal; Cobalt; Electrophysiology; Membrane Potentials; Microelectrodes; Neurons; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Sodium Channels; Somatosensory Cortex; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Tetraethylammonium Compounds; Tetrodotoxin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028019560

The CERT test results at 360 °C show that the degree of IG cracking increases with decreasing bulk chromium or carbon content. The CLT test results at 360 °C and 430 °C reveal that, as the amounts of chromium and carbon in solution decrease, the steady-state creep rate increases. The occurrence of severe IG cracking correlates with a high steady-state creep rate, suggesting that creep plays a role in the IG cracking behavior in argon at 360 °C. The failure mode of IG cracking and the deformation mode of creep are coupled through the formation of grain boundary voids that interlink to form grain boundary cavities, resulting in eventual failure by IG cavitation and ductile overload of the remaining ligaments. Grain boundary sliding may be enhancing grain boundary cavitation by redistributing the stress from inclined to more perpendicular boundaries and concentrating stress at discontinuities for the boundaries oriented 45 deg with respect to the tensile axis. Additions of carbon or chromium, which reduce the creep rate over all stress levels, also reduce the amount of IG fracture in CERT experiments. A damage accumulation model was formulated and applied to CERT tests to determine whether creep damage during a CERT test controls failure. Results show that, while creep plays a significant role in CERT experiments, failure is likely controlled by ductile overload caused by reduction in area resulting from grain boundary void formation and interlinkage. © 1994 The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, and ASM International.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249166985

This paper sets out to review natural disturbances and their effects in forests in Australia, and to determine whether or not the effects of management of forests for all of their benefits can be contained within the known effects of natural disturbance. The history and evolutionary significance of fire in Australia is reviewed, and the differing fire ecologies of two representative species, Eucalyptus regnans in the south-east (which is killed by fire and regenerates prolifically from seed after fire) and Eucalyptus marginata in the south-west (which survives all but the most severe fires and regenerates from both shoots and seeds) are outlined. The development of E. regnans following stand-replacing fire can be defined as highly resilient (returning quickly to the pre-disturbance state) and that of E. marginata as resistant (difficult to move from the pre-disturbance state). The topic of forest management in relation to disturbance is discussed within the context of forests of mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans), the world's tallest flowering plant, in south-eastern Australia. These forests in their natural state are essentially even-aged or at the most include two to three age-classes, the result of regeneration following stand-replacing bushfires. They produce timber of high value, and current land planning and management prescriptions allow for about one-half of the forest area to be managed for timber production on a sustained-yield basis. The silvicultural system is clear-felling, followed by burning to give stand-replacing conditions. Mountain ash regenerating from this system is one of the fastest growing tree species in the world and at its best has a volume increment of 50 m3 ha-1 year-1 and net primary production of 35 t ha-1 year-1 over the first 10 years. There is no definitive evidence of a loss of diversity of plant species in timber production forests. The greatest problem is to manage land for timber production and for the diversity of fauna which depend on nesting hollows in large dead or living trees. However, all of the species found in older forests can be found in regrowth forests which have been burned or logged over the past 50 years and which include large dead or living trees with nesting hollows. There has been speculation that harvesting mountain ash forests by clearfelling and regenerating them following slash-burning will lead to a loss of nutrients and a consequent loss of productivity. Nutrient cycling in mountain ash is shown to be resilient to disturbance. Rapid uptake of nutrients by the regenerating forest, immobilization of nutrients by microorganisms, and increased rates of nitrogen fixation are processes which lead to the conservation of nutrients following stand-replacing fires. There is no evidence of productivity decline following bushfire or timber harvesting. Another concern about forest harvesting is that there will be a reduction in carbon storage. The break-even point for E. regnans plantations yielding short-lived products (e.g. paper) is 37 years and for E. regnans forests grown for sawn timber, 60 years. Harvesting forests on rotations of 80-120 years will therefore result in an increase in carbon storage; however, it would take several rotations to restore carbon storage equivalent to that of old-age forest. Much of the literature on disturbance illustrates the difficulties of dealing with traditional and sometimes deeply entrenched concepts of how plant communities develop and the nature of the end-state of development. Development of mountain ash forest fits within Egler's model of initial floristic composition; there is no stable and self-perpetuating end-point, the climax is probably no more than the state where species change is immeasurably slow, and maximum diversity and productivity are maintained by random periodic disturbance. Does this set of conclusions provide the basis for management of the forest? The management of diversity in heath is discussed as an example; the issue is less contentious than in forests since no commercial product is harvested. Coastal heath on soils of poor fertility in Victoria also follows the model of initial floristic composition; diversity and productivity are maintained by fire, decreasing markedly within 20-50 years of disturbance. Management can use fire to maintain a mosaic of regenerated heathland to accommodate the range of responses of fauna and flora to disturbance, thereby maximizing diversity. The solution of maintaining diversity through an intermediate level of disturbance is well-established in the ecological literature; through disturbance, an equilibrium is never reached and higher diversity is maintained. In the managed forest, management dictates the disturbance regime (frequency, size and intensity) which must be fitted to the attributes, or life histories, of the organisms to be managed. This paper presents the view that timber harvesting in Australian forests is ecologically sustainable and that the effects of management can be contained within the framework of those caused by natural disturbance. Given that each plot in the forest differs from all other plots and that none is at steady state, a solution for the management of diversity is to use the whole of the forest estate (parks, stream reserves, catchment reserves, old-age forest, forests of different ages resulting from past fires and logging) so that diversity of the estate, rather than diversity of each plot, is maximized.",,"disturbance; eucalypt forest; fire; management; resilience; Australia; Eucalyptus marginata; Eucalyptus regnans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028163220

Rises of the level of these lakes present severe flooding hazards to developments on the lake bed. Effective planning for development of these lake beds requires a knowledge of the lake-level fluctuations that should be anticipated and also the effect of wind, earthquakes, and human activity on flooding. The historic record of fluctuations of the closed-basin lakes of the Great Basin of the western United States is too short to adequately define the recurrence intervals of high lake levels. Geomorphic evidence can supplement the historic record. Great Salt Lake is the largest closed-basin lake in the Great Basin and its lake bed has been the most extensively developed. In the 1980s the level of Great Salt Lake rose dramatically in response to a period of much above-average precipitation. The resulting flooding caused extensive damage to developments on the lake bed and posed serious dilemmas to Federal, state and local governments. Studies subsequent to the flooding reveal how geomorphic evidence can supplement the historic record and provide sufficient understanding of the lake's flooding hazard to guide development and planning. Under the climatic conditions that have existed for the past several thousand years, the still-water level of Great Salt Lake can be expected to rise to near the historic highstand, or slightly above, about once every one hundred years. Wind action extends flooding in some locations to elevations 2 m above the still-water elevation of the lake. If an understanding of flooding hazards guides the planning and engineering of developments on and around the lake, losses from future high-lake cycles can be significantly reduced. © 1994.",,"climate change; flood; geomorphology; hazard; USA, Utah, Great Salt Lake; Climate; Drainage; Flooding; Great Salt Lake, Utah; Lakes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028666877

This manifests itself in some of the most serious threats to mankind, such as global climatic change, environmental degradation, food shortage, hunger, poverty, and migration. It is the purpose of this editorial essay to make a contribution toward a reduction of some of these threats, notably those from climatic change. Specifically, I present a tractable climatic and environmental protection strategy which is designed to give concrete answers to such seemingly simple questions as: What has to be done? (This depends e.g. on the concentration stabilization objective of the Rio Climate Convention, and the global warming ceiling of the Enquete-Commission of the German Parliament). By whom does it have to be done? (This addresses the secret of a successful protection strategy which involves a fair burden sharing among the world's countries). When does it have to be done? (This discusses the problem of setting tractable, i.e. differentiated and binding emission targets). How can it be done? (This relates to individual countries, states, and municipalities. It is demonstrated for Germany how her commitment of a 25 to 30% CO2 reduction by 2005 can be achieved.) Moreover, the question is addressed: How many people and how much fossil fuel use can our planet stand? The major result is that without self-restraint climate and ecosystem protection cannot be maintained, because it is incompatible with trends in the wasteful fossil fuel use in the North and strong population growth in the South. Finally, a plea is made to share responsibility on the road toward a sustainable future. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027977496

The interrelationships between these poising mechanisms turn out to be strictly hierarchical. In the presence of antimycin A, an inhibitor of ferredoxin-dependent cyclic electron transport, the reduction of both, oxaloacetate and nitrite, but not that of oxygen restores CO2 fixation. When oxaloacetate and nitrite are added at low concentrations simultaneously during steady-state CO2 fixation, the reduction of nitrite is clearly preferred over the reduction of oxaloacetate, but CO2 fixation is not influenced. Nitrite reduction is not decreased upon addition of oxaloacetate, but vice versa. This is due to the regulation of NADP-malate dehydrogenase activation by electron pressure via the ferredoxin/thioredoxin system on the one hand, and by the NADPH/(NADP+NADPH) ratio (anabolic reduction charge, ARC) on the other hand. Thus the closing of the 'malate valve' prevents drainage of reducing equivalents from the chloroplast (1) when a low ARC indicates a high demand for NADPH in the stroma and (2) when nitrite reduction reduces the electron pressure at ferredoxin. The 'malate valve' is opened when cyclic electron transport is inhibited by antimycin A. Under these conditions the rate of malate formation is higher than in the absence of the inhibitor even in the presence of oxaloacetate, thus indicating that the regulation of the 'malate valve' functions at various redox states of the acceptor side of Photosystem I. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","CO2 assimilation; cyclic electron flow; malate valve; nitrite reduction; poising mechanisms; redox state",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028313722

From the center-to-limb behavior of the 7270-Å and 8900-Å CH4 bands, the stratospheric methane mixing ratio is limited to f(hook)CH4,3 &lt; 1.7 × 10-3, with a nominal value of f(hook)CH4,3 = 3.5 × 10-4, one to two orders of magnitude less than pre-Voyager estimates, but in agreement with a number of recent ultraviolet and thermal infrared measurements, and largely in agreement with the tropopause mixing ratio implied by Voyager temperature measurements. Upper limits to the stratospheric haze mass column abundance and 6190-Å and 8900-Å haze opacities are 0.61 μg cm-2 and 0.075 and 0.042, respectively, with nominal values of 0.20 μg cm-2 and 0.025 and 0.014 for the 0.2-μm radius particles preferred by the recent Voyager PPS analysis of Pryor et al. (1992, Icarus 99, 302-316). The tropospheric CH4 haze opacities are comparable to that found in the stratosphere, i.e., upper limits of 0.104 and 0.065 at 6190 Å and 8900 Å, respectively, with nominal values of 0.085 and 0.058. This indicates a column abundance less than 11.0 μg cm-2, corresponding to the methane gas content within a well-mixed 3% methane tropospheric layer only 0.1 cm think near the 1.5-bar CH4 condensation level. Constraints on the single-scattering albedos of these hazes include (1) for the stratospheric component, 6190-Å and 8900-Å imaginary indices of refraction less than 0.047 and 0.099, respectively, with 0.000 (conservative scattering) being the nominal value at both wavelengths, and (2) CH4 haze single-scattering albedos greater than 0.85 and 0.50 at these two wavelengths, with conservative scattering again begin the preferred value. However, conservative scattering is ruled out for the opaque cloud near 3 bars marking the bottom of the visible atmosphere. Specifically, we find cloud single-scattering albedos of 0.915 ± 0.006 at 6340 Å, 0.775 ± 0.012 at 7490 Å, and 0.803 ± 0.010 at 8260 Å. Global models utilizing a complete global spectrum confirm the red-absorbing character of the 3-bar cloud. The global-mean model has ∼7.7 times greater stratospheric aerosol content then the Equatorial Region. An analysis of stratospheric haze precipitation rates indicates a steady-state haze production rate of 0.185-1.5 × 10-14 g cm-2 sec-1, in agreement with recent theoretical photochemical estimates.

Overall, CO/CO2 emission ratios from the mix of fossil fuel combustion sources have been reduced by about half during 1976–1990. Also, the tropospheric abundance of hydroxyl radical (OH), which is the main sink for CO, is proposed to have increased globally by about 1.0±0.8% yr−1 [Prinn et al., 1992]. We use a simple two‐box model to examine the impact of shrinking emissions and increasing OH on the global abundance of CO.

Adsorption measurements indicate that less than 1% of the dye can be accommodated on the particles ruling out surface area effects. Further the size parameter of these particles is too small to allow for any morphological resonances. The colloidal solutions were pumped with pulses from a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm. The fluorescence from the colloidal solutions was collected and sent to an optical multichannel analyzer as well as through a monochromator to a fast photodiode. The wavelength integrated fluorescence of the pure dye as a function of pump energy exhibited a strong saturation while the emission for the colloid however exhibited almost no saturation behavior. When the energy of the excitation pulses was increased, the unpolarized emission from the colloid at λ approx. 617 nm grew rapidly and narrowed as shown in Fig. 1. The λ approx. 617 nm peak emission plotted against pump energy shows a linear behavior with a well defined threshold for the change in slope efficiency at 617 nm. Careful examination of data obtained via Q-switched mode-locked pumping reveals that distinct slope changes (marked as A, B and C in Fig. 2) take place over the entire excitation range. At low pump pulse energies, the emission spectrum of the pure rhodamine 640 perchlorate dye solution exhibited a linewidth of 36 nm as compared to the 76 nm width of the colloidal solution containing ρ = 8.4 × 1010/cm3. However as the pump energy was increased, the lineshape data revealed that at the same pump energy where the first slope change in the input-output behavior is observed, the emission linewidth collapses rapidly to ≤4 nm for the colloidal solution whereas it remained unchanged for the pure dye. This data supports the view that quasi-steady-state laser behavior is taking place in the disordered dye-colloidal system. Excitation with a train of 80 picosecond pulses also revealed a threshold behavior in the temporal characteristics of the output. When the pump pulse energy was below those required for the onset of laser action, the peak emission at 614 nm exhibited a long 4-ns decay identical to that observed in the pure dye solutions at all pump energies. When the pump pulse energy was increased beyond the threshold point, a sharp spike appeared which was shorter than the 300 ps system resolution. Further increasing the energy resulted in only the sharp spike and a nearly complete recovery between pulses in the modelocked and Q-switched train.

Insertion of the endoscope caused measurable changes in auditory brain stem response latency and amplitude. Distortion product otoacoustic emission amplitudes were reduced an average of 6 dB with greater loss close to the round window. Frequencies above 18 kHz, corresponding to the region of endoscopy, were not evaluated in this preliminary study and are suspected to have sustained more damage.

Protonation (CF3CO2H) of the 'side-on' bonded dinuclear vinylidene complexes [Mo2{μ-σ:η2-(4e)-C=CR2}(CO) 4(η-C5H5)2] (R = H or Me) afforded the bridged μ-vinyl complexes [Mo2{OC(O)CF3}(μ-CH=CR2)(CO) 4(η-C5H5)2], whereas a similar reaction of one of the isomers of [Mo2{μ-σ:η2-(4e)-C=C(Ph)Me}(CO) 4(η-C5H5)2] afforded the isomerie complexes [Mo2{OC(O)CF3}{μ-CH=C(Me)Ph}(CO) 4(η-C5H5)2] and [Mo2{OC(O)CF3}{μ-CH=C(Ph)Me}(CO) 4(η-C5H5)2]. Deuterium-labelling experiments and extended-Hückel molecular-orbital (EHMO) calculations suggest that these reactions involve delivery of a proton by CF3CO2H to the α-carbon of the vinylidene complex in a direction perpendicular to the plane containing the β-carbon substituents. Protonation of the α-carbon is also implicated in the reaction of [Mo2{μ-σ:η2-(4e)-C=CMe2}(CO) 4(η-C5H5)2] with HBF4·Et2O or CF3SO3H where the products are the unusual cationic species [Mo2{μ-σ:η2-CH2C(Me)CH 2}(CO)3(η-C5H5)2] [X] (X = BF4 or CF3SO3). The same cations are also produced by α protonation of the μ-allylidene complex [Mo2{μ-σ:η3-CHC(Me)CH2}(CO) 4(η-C5H5)2].

In the solid state the complex conta ins an unusual bonding mode for a dinuclear allyl complex, the CH2C(Ph)CH2 fragment being bonded via η2 co-ordination to one molybdenum atom and a three-centre two-electron interaction between one of the CH2 groups of the allyl and both metal atoms, which are bonded to each other by a formal triple bond. In solution this cation and the related methyl-substituted species show dynamic behaviour resulting in equivalencing on the NMR time-scale of the two anti-and two syn-protons of the allyl ligand. The reaction of diazomethane with [Mo2{μ-σ:η2-(4e)-C=CR2}(CO) 4(η-C5H5)2] (R = H or Me) has also been studied. The reactions lead respectively to the formation of the μ-allene complexes [Mo2(μ-η2CH2=C=CR2)(CO) 4(η-C5H5)2].

Ethanol was found to interact strongly with both phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) bilayers, giving 2H NMR quadrupolar splittings for CH3CD2OH between 6.3 and 9.4 kHz. The quadrupolar splittings for ethanol in gel-phase lipids remained well resolved and were not significantly larger than those in the Lα phase, suggesting that little or no ethanol was bound in the hydrocarbon interior of the bilayer. Ethanol binding significantly altered the orientation of the lipid headgroups, as shown with headgroup-deuterated PC bilayers. The entire lengths of the acyl chains were significantly disordered by the ethanol interaction, evidenced by significant reductions in the 2H NMR order parameters of the chains. The disordering corresponds to an increase in the area per lipid by an estimated 6% with one ethanol molecule per lipid, and a total of 18% with a second ethanol per lipid. This pronounced area increase is presumably caused by the disruption of lipid packing in the rigid region of the glycerol backbone rather than in the acyl chains, since the order of hydrocarbon chains is not affected to a significant degree by incorporation of alkanes and long-chain alcohols into the hydrocarbon interior. From these data it was concluded that ethanol interacts with phospholipid bilayers at the lipid-water interface (consisting of the headgroup, glycerol backbone, and uppermost chain methylene groups) rather than in the hydrocarbon interior. An interfacial binding of ethanol that is also capable of disordering the entire length of the acyl chains could explain the small ethanol-induced fluidization of membrane lipids that has been reported frequently in the literature. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

The bacterial metabolism of pyruvic acid produces either acetyl phosphate, H2, and CO2 or acetyl phosphate and formic acid. Reactions involving the production of acetyl phosphate from pyruvic acid are described as “phosphoroclastic reactions.” Phosphoroclastic reaction is associated only with the reversible transformation of pyruvic acid to acetyl phosphate, H2, and CO2. Enzymes of the phosphoroclastic reaction are localized in the cytoplasm and are constitutive in SRB. The phosphoroclastic reaction is usually conducted in 1- to 3-ml volumes, using stoppered cuvettes or tubes flushed with purified N2. Activity of the reaction can be measured by following specific substrates and products of the reaction. Reduced ferredoxin generated by the phosphoroclastic reaction may interface with thiosulfate reductase, bisulfite reductase, and other reactions in which sulfur compounds are used as electron acceptors by the SRB. An important product of the phosphoroclastic reaction is the generation of molecular hydrogen as it represents a most efficient means of electron consumption. The metabolism of molecular hydrogen by SRB is important because most can use H2 as an electron donor to support growth. © 1994, Elsevier Inc.

The focus primarily has been on the outlook for alternatives to the petroleum products. In this spectrum alcohol manufacture from biomass has attracted a large attention all over the world which could be used as an alternative source to petrol or in blends with petrol. The National Research Council (NRC) has substantially emphasized on the reduction of CO2 emissions and the other so-called green house gases. The NRC committee also recommends better evaluations of the processes for converting the biomass / lignocellulosic wastes to ethanol that will lessen the U.S. dependence on foreign oil Among the factors behind the move to bio-based materials are the environmental concerns, the availability of abundant, renewable agricultural and. forest resources that are both inexpensive and under-utilized. © 1994, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

In order to determine the extent of fatty acid metabolism alterations, we measured steady state [14C]palmitate oxidation and the incorporation of [14C]palmitate into the neutral lipid pool in a rat model of adriamycin cardiomyopathy. Isolated hearts from control rats and rats treated with adriamycin were perfused with 1.2 mmol/l of [14C]palmitate for 30 min to achieve steady state oxidation measured as [14C]O2 production: then perfused with 1.2 mmol/l of unlabelled palmitate. Hearts were killed early (0-5 min) or late (10-30 min) after the [14C]palmitate perfusion, to determine incorporation into the neutral lipid pool, and neutral lipid pool utilization. In the control group steady state oxidation was reached in 10 min ([14C]O2 production = 580 ± 61 nmol/min/g dry wt) of perfusion. In the adriamycin treated group, mean CO2 production was significantly reduced at 10 min (329 ± 44 nmol/min/g dry wt, P &lt; 0.01 v control). At 30 min, [14C]O2 production in the treated group was not significantly different than controls (521 ± 65 nmol/min/g dry wt v 617 ± 36 nmol/min/g dry wt, P = N.S.). The incorporation of [14C]palmitate into the neutral lipid pool measured in the early subgroup was significantly reduced for adriamycin treated hearts v controls (7.2 ± 0.6 v 12.0 ± 1.4 μmol/g dry wt respectively, P &lt; 0.01). In the control group14C labelled neutral lipid reduced with time to 8.4 ± 1.1 μmol/g dry wt (P &lt; 0.05) in the late group. The adriamycin group demonstrated no significant change between early and late measurements. In conclusion, in adriamycin cardiomyopathy: (1) there is significant delay in achieving steady state palmitate oxidation, although the steady state rate is near normal; (2) palmitate incorporation into the neutral lipid pool is reduced; (3) neutral lipid pool utilization may also be reduced. These data suggest impaired uptake of palmitate into the cell in adriamycin cardiomyopathy, with a relatively maintained capacity for oxidative metabolism. © 1994 Academic Press Limited.","Fatty acids; Isolated rat heart model; Neutral lipid pool; Oxidative metabolism; Triglycerides, Adriamycin cardiomyopathy; [14C]-Palmitate","doxorubicin; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cardiomyopathy; controlled study; fatty acid metabolism; heart muscle metabolism; intraperitoneal drug administration; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Animal; Doxorubicin; Fatty Acids; Hemodynamics; In Vitro; Kinetics; Lipids; Male; Myocardial Diseases; Oxidation-Reduction; Palmitates; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028349006

The model yields an expression for the emission rates in the form of a one-dimensional integral that has to be calculated numerically. The solution is based on the quasienergy wave function of the ground state. The approach is very significantly facilitated by suppressing the harmonic components of the wave function at the position of the zero-range potential. This approximation is found to be very accurate except for the third harmonic. In spite of the simplicity of the model, the harmonic spectrum exhibits a very involved structure, occasional harmonics being strongly suppressed, with cusps and spikes for certain evenly spaced intensities. The latter are due to channel closings for the same intensities in above-threshold ionization. The harmonics near and beyond the cutoff of the plateau are amenable to a completely analytical approximation. This approximation shows how the classical model of Krause, Schafer, and Kulander [Phys. Rev. Lett. 68, 3535 (1992)] is embedded in a fully-quantum-mechanical description. Results are also given for the harmonic production rates in an elliptically polarized laser field; they display fair agreement with recent measurements. The model should adequately describe harmonic emission by negative ions with just one bound s state. Moreover, it also gives a fair description of harmonic emission by an atom, particularly if the ground-state energy of the zero-range potential is adjusted not to the binding energy of the atom, but rather to the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state. The reason why this is appropriate is found in lowest-order perturbation theory, which sheds some light on the physical origin of the plateau. © 1994 The American Physical Society.",,"Approximation theory; Atoms; Electrons; Fourier transforms; Ions; Laser beams; Light polarization; Mathematical models; Perturbation techniques; Quantum theory; Three dimensional; Binding energy; Dipole moment; Ground state; High order harmonic generation; Ponderomotive energy; Quasienergy wave function; Zero range potential; Harmonic generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028480087

A semi-continuous flow apparatus with an on-line gas Chromatograph was designed and constructed for conducting experiments to obtain high pressure supercritical fluid-liquid phase equilibrium data for binary and ternary systems. Isothermal P-x-y data were obtained for CO2/benzene, CO2/cyclohexane, CO2/acetonitrile, CO2/benzene/cyclohexane and CO2/benzene/acetonitrile systems up to the mixture critical pressure. Ternary data were obtained with three initial concentrations of liquid mixture to investigate the potential of using supercritical CO2 in breaking or shifting the benzene/acetonitrile and benzene/cyclohexane azeotropes. The analyses of the experimental data indicated that for the CO2/benzene/cyclohexane system at 42.3°C and a pressure of 1.926 MPa, the benzene/cyclohexane azeotrope was shifted from 50.0 mol% cyclohexane to greater than 71.2mol% cyclohexane (on a CO2-free basis). Similarly, in the case of the CO2/benzene/acetonitrile system at 45.3°C and 2.326 MPa, the benzene/acetonitrile azeotrope shifted from 54.3 mol% benzene to greater than 70.3 mol% benzene. These systems are among the few documented shifts in azeotropic composition attained using supercritical fluids. For the Peng-Robinson equation of state with the one-parameter mixing rule, relative errors of the order of 15% in the prediction of bubble point pressures were encountered at higher pressures, i.e. in the near-critical region. At lower pressures, however, the fit results were in agreement with the experimental bubble point pressures. Excellent representation of binary supercritical fluid-liquid phase behavior for these systems was obtained up to the mixture critical point when pressure- and composition-dependent mixing rules were incorporated. Although the two-parameter mixing rules provided very good descriptions of the two-phase envelope for the ternary mixtures, it was unable to predict any shift in the azeotropic composition (on a CO2-free basis) in the presence of supercritical CO2. © 1994.","azeotropic separations; composition-dependent mixing rule.; equation of state; experiments; pressure-dependent mixing rule; SCF fluid-liquid high pressure; supercritical fluids; two-parameter mixing rules","Acetonitrile; Azeotropes; Benzene; Carbon dioxide; Composition effects; Equations of state; Flow of fluids; Gas chromatography; Paraffins; Pressure effects; High pressure supercritical fluid-liquid phase equilibrium; Mixture critical pressure; On line gas chromatograph; Peng-Robinson equation of state; Semicontinuous flow apparatus; Phase equilibria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028391966

For those pollutants still showing a violation of the quality objectives for the Rhine in the year 1995, a range finding method is used, to predict the costs and impact of abatement measures exceeding BAT and BEP on the water quality of the Rhine. So, EVER is a management tool to prioritize the work to be done within the frame-work of the IRC, triggering the application of e.g. sophisticated calculation models for a selected number of priority pollutants. In EVER, the prognosis of the reduction of specific discharge rates for approximately forty priority pollutants is given for twelve sub-catchment areas for the year 1995. Fifteen of the selected pollutants will satisfy the water quality objectives in 1995. Twenty (half) of the selected pollutants will still violate the quality objectives at several monitoring locations. These twenty pollutants are the basis for priorities to be set within the frame-work of the IRC for phase 3 (1995-2000) of the RAP. For these pollutants, additional abatement measures exceeding BAT and BEP are selected in EVER for the manageable groups of sources (anthropogenic non-point sources, industrial sources and municipal sources). Each measure is analyzed separately for costs and effectiveness. Finally the results of this project are integrated into a matrix system which will enable us to select the most effective mix of pollution abatement measures at the lowest costs.For priority pollutants, the international Rhine Action Programme (RAP) aims to meet the quality objectives for the Rhine, set by the International Rhine Commission (IRC), by the year 2000. An assessment must be carried out to define additional measures exceeding best available technology (BAT) for point sources and best environmental practice (BEP) for diffuse sources for those priority pollutants still violating the quality objectives of the Rhine after implementing BAT and BEP only. To carry out the required assessments, an excessive amount of work and money is needed, including the application of sophisticated calculation models. For prioritizing reasons, the Institute for Inland Water Management and Waste Water Treatment (RIZA) initiated a project called EVER, which was conducted by DHV Water BV. EVER is the abbreviation of the Dutch equivalent for Effective Distribution of Emission Reductions (Effective Verdeling van Emissie Reducties). The aim of this project is to carry out a first and crude evaluation of the impact of abatement measures (BAT and BEP), as set by the IRC for the period 1985-1995. For those pollutants still showing a violation of the quality objectives for the Rhine in the year 1995, a range finding method is used, to predict the costs and impact of abatement measures exceeding BAT and BEP on the water quality of the Rhine. So, EVER is a management tool to prioritize the work to be done within the frame-work of the IRC, triggering the application of e.g. sophisticated calculation models for a selected number of priority pollutants. In EVER, the prognosis of the reduction of specific discharge rates for approximately forty priority pollutants is given for twelve sub-catchment areas for the year 1995. This prognosis is used to predict concentrations at eight international monitoring locations in the Rhine basin, using the discharges and concentrations of the year 1985 as a reference. The predicted concentrations for the year 1995 are compared with the (preliminary) water quality objectives as set by the IRC. The results indicate, that for six of the selected pollutants the number of available data is too small for sound predictions. Fifteen of the selected pollutants will satisfy the water quality objectives in 1995. Twenty (half) of the selected pollutants will still violate the quality objectives at several monitoring locations. These twenty pollutants are the basis for priorities to be set within the frame-work of the IRC for phase 3 (1995-2000) of the RAP. For these pollutants,additional abatement measures exceeding BAT and BEP are selected in EVER for the manageable groups of sources (anthropogenic non-point sources, industrial sources and municipal sources). Each measure is analyzed separately for costs and effectiveness. Finally the results of this project are integrated into a matrix system which will enable us to select the most effective mix of pollution abatement measures at the lowest costs. The result of the selected additional measures exceeding BAT and BEP shows that 17 pollutants will still violate the quality objectives.","Calamities; Emission reduction; Industrial sources; Micro-pollutants; Municipal sources; Non-point anthropogenic and natural sources; Nutrients; Prioritizing models; Rhine Action Programme; Surface water quality","Cost accounting; Environmental protection; Estimation; Mathematical models; Monitoring; River basin projects; Water pollution control; Water quality; Best available technology; Best environmental practice; EVER project; Range finding method; Rhine riverbasin; Rivers; conference paper; cost benefit analysis; data analysis; environmental impact assessment; Europe; Netherlands; pollution control; prediction; river; waste water management; water management; water quality; cost analysis; diffuse source; point source; pollution abatement; river water quality; water quality management; Europe, Rhine River; Rivers; Water Pollution; Water Quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028161405

The results are comparable to those of much larger, rack-mounted devices used on shore, or the multiple instruments used by Lloyd's Register on shipboard. Portable monitors are particularly useful for small vessels, and have been applied to hot exhausts directly out of turbochargers, instead of the usual smokestack measurements. The test protocol evolved during this study will be useful in monitoring diesel engine exhaust emissions, before and after application of emission reduction techniques to assess their efficacy. Initial shipboard testing was conducted on three 82-ft U.S. Coast Guard Cutters (WPBs). The test protocol used was one based on the ISO 8178 procedure (1), taking into account the speeds actually used by the vessels-their operating profile. Variables examined, aside from the effects of shaft rpm on the pollutant levels, were: water depth, current, effect of towing another boat, wind direction and sea state. Pollution was determined quantitatively as a function of power, and also fuel consumption. Shaft speed, as on larger vessels, showed the greatest effect on the pollutants-with much more scatter at lower speeds (<30% of full power). As expected, cold starts and accelerating transients had higher NOx levels than at steady state for short durations. © 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc,.",,"Chimneys; Diesel engines; Emission control; Exhaust systems (engine); Gas emissions; Ocean currents; Ship smokestacks; Emission reduction; Lloyd's registers; Multiple instruments; Pollutant levels; Portable instrument; Short durations; U.s. coast guards; Wind directions; Water pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072438388

In fact, in such environment, the retransmissions caused by the higher layers protocols can cause serious congestion problems. As a case study, the interconnection of a Gbit/s CRMA LAN through an ATM-based WAN is here considered. An Integrated Flow and Access Control (IFAC) protocol is proposed which exploiting the characteristics of the CRMA access scheme regulates the emission of cells towards the CRMA/ATM InterWorking Unit so that its buffer resources are not saturated. The emission of the ATM stations is controlled via a backpressure mechanism. The capacity of the InterWorking Unit buffer is virtually increased by utilizing the network latency as well as the station buffers. The protocol effectiveness has been validated through a simulation analysis. On the basis of the obtained results a study on the IWU buffer dimensioning has been carried out. In particular, the minimum buffer needed to carry a given load has been determined. Moreover, some criteria have been given to properly fix the capacity to be allocated through the ATM interface.",,"Buffer circuits; Frequency allocation; Interfaces (computer); Local area networks; Optimization; Performance; Queueing theory; Telecommunication traffic; Wide area networks; Asynchronous transfer mode; Backpressure mechanism; Buffer sizing; Cell loss; Cyclic reservation multiple access; Integrated flow and access control; InterWorking unit; Network protocols",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028026537

Two transition states, a ""cis-gauche"" and a ""trans-anti"", have been calculated. Both transition states are characterized by a charge imbalance in the sense that charge derealization into the carbonyl group of the incipient product enolate ion lags behind proton transfer or charge localization on the a-carbon of the reactant enolate ion is ahead of proton transfer. The imbalance for the cis-gauche TS, which is a fully optimized structure, is larger than that for the trans-anti TS. This is a consequence of only partially optimizing the structure of the trans-anti TS by constraining the α-carbon to a planar geometry; hence, the trans-anti TS represents a model for a more delocalized transition state. At the MP2/6-311+G∗∗ level, the cis-gauche TS is 10.5 kcal/mol lower in energy than the trans-anti TS. Possible reasons why the less delocalized and more imbalanced cis-gauche TS is more stable than the more delocalized trans-anti TS are discussed. The reaction paths implied by the imbalanced transition states are conveniently described by means of 6-corner, hexagonal More O'Ferrall-Jencks diagrams. Corners 1 and 4 define the reactants and products, respectively; corners 2 and 3, which are 13 kcal/mol above the reactants/products, represent a hypothetical intermediate with the geometry of the acetaldehyde with the negative charge localized on the a-carbon (""aldanion""); and corners 5 and 6, which are 25.4 kcal/mol above the reactants/products, are approximated by the polarized structure H+CH2=CH-O-with the geometry of the enolate ion (""enaldehyde""). The trans-anti TS also shows a structural imbalance in the sense that C-C π-bond formation in the incipient product enolate ion is somewhat ahead of proton transfer; no such imbalance is found for the cis-gauche TS. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

The program goals were to: (1) control CO emissions to less than 150 ppm, (2) achieve smokeless cold start-up of the unit, (3) limit steam flow fluctuations to less than 10% of the average and (4) reduce combustible matter in ash. Natural gas cofiring was found to have a significant impact on CO emissions. The CO emissions were controlled to less than 50 ppm when cofiring natural gas at 0.47 to 0.63 Nm3/s (60,000 to 80,000 SCFH), corresponding to 29.3 to 35.6% of the total heat input. This compares to RDF baseline CO emissions of 530 to 1950 ppm. More moderate natural gas inputs of 0.24 to 0.47 Nm3/s (30,000 to 60,000 SCFH) resulted in CO emissions in the 60 to 550 ppm range. During start-up with gas, the average and maximum stack gas opacities were 8% to 22%, compared to average and maximum opacities of 20% and 61% with coal as the primary start-up fuel. The emitted stack gas was clear during gas start-up and black during coal start-up. Steam load fluctuations were evaluated in terms of the standard deviation (STD) in steam output over the test period. Gas cofiring, under optimum conditions, decreased the steam load STD to 7% from 16% during optimum baseline RDF firing. Baseline steam load STD as high as 25% was measured, with wider fluctuations occurring during periods of low average steam output. Carbon in ash was low (bottom ash under 1.5%, fly ash under 6%) for both cofiring and baseline operation. A modest reduction in carbon in ash due to natural gas cofiring was observed. The gross boiler efficiency increased by 3% to 5.0% during gas cofiring at a rate of 0.14 to 0.31 Nm3/s (18,000 to 40,000 SCFH). Natural gas cofiring also resulted in a reduction in emissions of SO2, CO2, hydrocarbons (HC), and polychlorinated dibenzopdioxins and furans (PCDD/PCDF). The reductions in SO2 and CO2 emissions are due to differences in fuel composition, natural gas has no sulfur and a lower carbon to hydrogen ratio. Reductions in CO, HC and PCDD/PCDF emissions are due to improved burnout of combustible matter in the furnace.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon monoxide; Firing (of materials); Gas emissions; Gas fired boilers; Hydrocarbons; Natural gas; Opacity; Refuse derived fuels; Steam; Sulfur dioxide; Fuel composition; Municipal waste incinerator; Natural gas cofiring; Refuse derived fuel incinerator; Standard deviation; Refuse incinerators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028045850

Aerojet has developed a system that can dispose of these types of materials in a three-step process that meets all environmental regulatory requirements. Step 1 is the removal of the energetic material from its container, if required, using high pressure water. Step 2 involves macerating the material in water to facilitate desensitization of Class 1.1 and Class 1.3 energetic materials prior to incineration (Step 3) which is structured around a dual chamber, fixed hearth incinerator designed to operate under negative pressure to eliminate fugitive emissions. This incinerator is a two-stage, controlled- air unit equipped with tandem liquid scrubbers capable of limiting particulates to less than 1.0 micron with a 95% efficiency at 0.5 micron, a design requirement imposed by its originally intended use in the nuclear industry where high efficiency particulate adsorber (HEPA) filters were required on the output to ensure the capture of radioactive particles. Adapting the basic design to handling energetic materials principally involved the selection of different refractory materials; the original design produced a clean burning, low emissions incinerator capable of handling a variety of combustible solid and liquid feed streams. Additional improvements in emissions levels were made possible by using orthogonal experimental arrays and analyses based on Taguchi Methods®. This approach provided the needed insight into the effects of controllable factors on emissions to permit optimization of the operating parameters for the incinerator. Combustion efficiencies of 99.98+%, destruction and removal efficiencies (DRE) of 99.99+%, and emissions levels well below regulatory limits have been consistently observed which demonstrates the efficacy of this incinerator design and of the experimental approach used for operational optimization.",,"dioxin; explosive; furan derivative; nitrogen oxide; tetrachloroethylene; trichlorobenzene; air pollution; air quality; combustion; conference paper; hazardous waste; incineration; pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028240527

The assay is based on the observation that fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurs between donor (fluorescein) and acceptor (hexachlorofluorescein) fluorophores that are in close proximity due to their covalent attachment to the 3′ and 5′ ends of the complementary strands of a duplex oligodeoxynucleotide. FRET results in a reduction in the fluorescence emission intensity of fluorescein in the duplex DNA substrate relative to that observed for fluoresceinlabeled single stranded DNA. Therefore, an enhancement of fluorescein fluorescence (λex = 492 nm; λem = 520 nm) occurs upon helicase-catalyzed unwinding of the duplex DNA and separation of the complementary strands. The fluorescence assay is extremely sensitive, allowing DNA unwinding reactions to be monitored continuously at DNA concentrations as low as 1 nM in a fluorescence stopped-flow experiment. We demonstrate the use of this DNA substrate in pre-steady state, single turnover studies of duplex DNA unwinding catalyzed by the Escherichia coli Rep helicase, monitored by fluorescence stopped flow. We show that the fluorescence enhancement monitors Rep-catalyzed DNA unwinding by comparisons with identical kinetic studies carried out using rapid chemical quench-flow techniques. Single turnover kinetic studies performed at 1 nM DNA as a function of excess Rep concentration show that Rep-catalyzed unwinding of an 18 base pair duplex containing a 3′-ss-(dT)20 tail is biphasic and can be described by the sum of two exponential terms. The observed rate constant of the first phase is independent of [Rep] (20–300 nM) and measures the rapid single turnover unwinding of the duplex DNA by Rep dimers bound in productive complexes (1.3 ± 0.2 s−1; 23 ± 3 base pairs s−1 at 25.0 °C). The observed rate constant for the second phase increases linearly with [Rep], reflecting DNA unwinding that is limited by a Rep binding event occurring with a bimolecular rate constant of (1.8 ±0.1) x 105 M−1 s−1, which may reflect the rate constant for Rep dimerization on DNA. Kinetic competition studies indicate that both Rep subunits are bound stably to the DNA substrate in the productive complex that is unwound in the fast phase. The results of these kinetic studies are consistent with an active, rolling mechanism for Rep-catalyzed unwinding of DNA [Wong, I., &amp; Lohman, T. M., (1992) Science 256, 350]. This fluorescence assay should greatly facilitate further mechanistic studies of helicase-catalyzed DNA unwinding. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

Rather large fluid fluxes are required, however, for this type of transport to be significant in terms of dissolution and precipitation of minerals. Before diagenetic processes are attributed to pore water flow, semi-quantitative calculation of flow rates and duration of flow should be attempted. Heat flow in sedimentary basins is normally dominated by conduction, except on a local scale. The upwards pore water flux due to compaction is on average smaller than the subsidence rate, and the thermal anomalies caused by compaction are moderate in modern basins. Dissolution and precipitation of minerals which are in equilibrium with the pore water occur when the flow is oblique relative to the isotherms. Due to the low solubility/temperature gradient of the common silicate and carbonate minerals, very large fluxes of pore water are required to transport significant volumes of mass in solution. The greatest potential for transporting solids and creating secondary porosity is during meteoric water flow, because the flow rate then may be several orders of magnitude higher than what is typical for compaction-driven flow. Quartz overgrowth corresponding to 3% of the rock volume requires a total flow of 10 8cm 3 cm -2 if the silica is introduced by vertical compaction-driven flow from a source outside the sandstone. Pore water flow precipitating quartz due to cooling will dissolve carbonate cement at a much higher rate. An external import of silica through the flow of water would be expected to cement up the most permeable pathways, such as fractures and well-sorted permeable sand beds. In the case of carbonate cement the solubility gradient is negative and upwards flowing and cooling pore water would cause dissolution rather than precipitation. Also in the case of carbonate rocks, large-scale mass transfer such as dolomitization is easier to explain as occurring at relatively shallow depths rather than during deeper burial. Ore minerals like galena have a steep solubility/temperature gradient, but concentrated precipitation requires rapid cooling of hot water. Such conditions are most likely to be met when hot fluids are cooled near the surface. © 1994 The Geological Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000808580

We have developed a novel affinity approach to purify P450 102 in a single chromatographic step and have studied the spectroscopic, catalytic, nucleotide binding, and crystallization properties of the highly purified enzyme. B. megaterium ATCC 14581 was grown to high cell density, and P450 102 was purified rapidly and in high yield by chromatography on adenosine-2′5′-diphosphate agarose from crude cell-free extract. The cytochrome bound to the column with remarkable avidity, in contrast to the significantly weaker binding observed for NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. Chromatographic behavior also showed that the cytochrome bound NADP+-type nucleotides more tightly than any other cellular polypeptide. The purified protein was electrophoretically homogeneous and had essentially theoretical contents of FAD, FMN, and heme. Optical spectra showed the expected heme and flavin absorption bands, and three previously undescribed charge-transfer-type absorptions were characterized. Molar extinction coefficients in the oxidized, fully reduced, and ferrous carbonyl states have been determined; notable is the large soret extinction in the ferrous carbonyl state (ε449nm = 143,500 M-1 cm-1). Final preparations were active in the oxidation of a wide variety of substrates. Of the C14 alkyl compounds studied, tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide showed the highest substrate-dependent oxidation of NADPH, followed by myristate and myristyl alcohol; however, myristate exhibited the lowest Km value.

The rate of methane formation was measured at 1 atm and the state of the working catalyst was characterized by XPS immediately after reaction. With the exception of AlOx, each of the oxides was found to enhance the rate of CO methanation relative to that observed over unpromoted Rh. The maximum degree of rate enhancement occurs at an oxide coverage of approximately half a monolayer. AlOx retards the formation of methane in direct proportion to the oxide coverage. FeOx behaves in a manner identical to that of AlOx in the case of CO2 hydrogenation, whereas all of the other oxides studied produce a maximum degree of methanation rate enhancement at an oxide coverage of half a monolayer. The enhancement of CO and CO2 hydrogenation is attributed to the formation of Lewis acid-base complexes between the oxygen end of adsorbed CO (or H2CO formed during the reaction) and anionic vacancies present at the edge of the oxide-metal boundary. The degree of enhancement of CO and CO2 hydrogenation is found to increase with the average oxidation state of the metal in the oxide overlayer. This trend is attributed to the direct relationship between Lewis acidity of an oxide and the oxidation state of the metal in the oxide.

Historical data and General Circulation Model (GCM) output of daily CP corresponding to the present (IxCO2) and doubled atmospheric CO2 (2xCO2) concentration are taken as inputs. Time series of both local and areal BMDI are simulated and their statistics are calculated. Under the dry continental climate of eastern Nebraska a highly variable spatial response to climate change has been obtained. Most of the local and the areal average drought indices reflect a somewhat wetter and a more variable climate under the 2xCO2 conditions. The results may be sensitive to the GCM used. The methodology can be used elsewhere to estimate statistically the impact of global climate change on local/regional drought.",,"Atmospheric movements; Climatology; Mathematical models; Atmospheric circulation patterns; Bhalme Mooley drought index; Drought; General circulation model; Stochastic link; Climate change; Change; Climate; Drought; Local/Areal; atmospheric carbon dioxide; atmospheric circulation model; climate change; drought index; rainfall deficit; USA, Nebraska",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028534315

Participation in such a regime is expected to hinge on the ""fairness"" of the distributional consequences. We find that initial permit allocations by population and/or GDP are unlikely to induce participation by most countries of Eastern Europe and FSU because of the net costs involved. We identify a set of initial allocations that would at least compensate these countries. A fair treatment of the countries in Western Europe (WE) is here one which equalizes net costs per GDP. For a wide set of cost functions for carbon emission reductions, the cost gains that WE would reap from a tradeable permit system relative to unilateral reductions by WE as a group are found to be on the order of 85 percent. This would imply, among other things, a significant increase in WE's capacity to make further emissions reductions. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Carbon emissions reductions; equity; tradeable permits","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Economics; Environmental protection; Geographical regions; International law; Reduction; Carbon emissions reductions; Cost functions; Equity; Global warming; Permit allocations; Tradeable permit treaty; Gas emissions; carbon emission; emission control; permit allocation; tradeable permit; Europe; USSR",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028450117

The emissions include leaching, run-off and erosion losses of nitrogen and phosphorus, volatile losses of ammonia, and farm waste discharges. Farm waste discharges and nitrate leaching from agricultural fields have received considerable attention during the last few decades, but more recently the remaining loss categories have also been recognized as substantial contributors of nutrients to the environment. Environmental targets have been set in the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) Ministerial Declaration of 15 February 1988, stating that a significant reduction (e.g. 50%) of the nutrient load to the Baltic Sea shall be reached before 1995. A similar target for the Oslo and Paris (OSPARCOM) Convention waters has been set by the North Sea ministers, while the EU Nitrate Directive expresses an environmental standard by setting an upper limit to nitrate concentrations in groundwater. It is argued here that in most instances only marginal reductions in agricultural emissions will be achieved under the current policies before 1995 (or later). Exceptions are seen in transition economy countries where fertilizer consumption and livestock production have decreased significantly. As agriculture is a major source of nutrients to convention waters, the overall 50% reduction target will not be met. Furthermore, it is argued that there is scope for a considerable reduction of losses from agriculture and that the instruments to achieve the objectives are readily available. Measures should focus on the total input of nutrients to the agro-ecosystems and not so much attempt to regulate specific management practices. The more prominent instruments include the reduction or alteration of agricultural subsidies, market considerations and the use of environmental taxes (on fertilizers and nutrients in animal manure) combined with in-depth structural regulations. It is, however, necessary to generate further political willingness to ensure decisions and successful implementation of the various measures-a process which requires public attention. © 1994.",,"ammonia; ground water; nitrate; nitrogen; phosphorus; runoff; agriculture; atlantic ocean; conference paper; economics; environmental protection; germany; leaching; nutrient; poland; policy; pollution control; scandinavia; sea pollution; tax; ussr; waste disposal; water standard; Animalia; agricultural pollution; environmental legislation; environmental policy; marine pollution; nutrient loss; nutrients; pollution control; Baltic; Baltic Sea; Germany; North Sea; Poland; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028666036

In addition, environmental discussions are making the public increasingly sensitive and statutory environmental requirements are impeding the implementation of industrial planning and decision-making processes. In order for exploration for and production of hydrocarbons to remain calculable, economically and ecologically reasonable solutions must be found which are acceptable to ail concerned. This necessitates competent communication and coordination and a high degree of cooperation both within the company and vis-à-vis residents, authorities, ministries, interest groups and partners. Within the scope of these activities, environmental concerns for BEB can be roughly grouped into three main categories - permit procedures/legislation - emissions/recultivations - liability claims. The entrepreneurial challenge in solving these tasks necessitates an environmentally-oriented management and a change of strategy towards a preventive-protective approach which take into account ecological aspects and thus Co-responsibility for environmental quality in an appropriate manner. The present paper describes two examples of this structural change, the first initiated by the lawmaker and the second by the company itself. With the introduction of the Environmental Impact Assessment as an instrument of preventive environmental policy, this change is required by law for specific public and private industry projects. From the example of a pipeline project, the resulting consequences for planning and the permit procedure are shown. The second example presents a programme aimed at analyzing the relationships between SO2 emissions from natural gas production in South Oldenburg areas and the (vegetational) damage to forests in the same region. © 1994 The Executive Board of the World Petroleum Congress Published by John Wiley & Sons.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054415721

Of particular concern is air pollution. During the late 1980s the nations involved in the Montreal protocol discussed the possibility of an international 'law of the atmosphere' (Graedel and Crutzen, 1989). Although a universal law was not forthcoming many industrialised nations and states have legislation defining acceptable present and future limits of emissions. In recent years the contributory role of various nitrogen oxides - known collectively as NOx - to the formation of acid rain, the greenhouse effect and smog has been widely acknowledged. As with many other pollutants the major source of NOx is fossil fuel combustion, especially in automobile engines. To combat NOx and other pollutants exhaust emissions control technologies have been developed. However, a major drawback with emission control is that there is often a fuel economy penalty to pay and although the concentration of one pollutant may be decreased another is increased. Moreover, while present techniques are adequate they will not satisfy future regulations. Therefore it is important to understand the mechanisms of NOx formation, how to control its production and emission and how future regulatory limits can be met.

Emission in the region 200-600 nm is found to result from two- or three-photon processes involving short-lived (≤ 20 ns) excited species. In the case of PBr3, emission is observed from D, D′ and E states of Br2 formed either by direct multiphoton dissociation of PBr3 or by 248 nm excitation of Br2 formed by single-photon dissocation of PBr3. The corresponding processes are energetically inaccessible for PCl3 and no emission from molecular chlorine is observed. There are additional emission features in both photolysis systems that do not correspond to any reported states of X2, PX or PX2 (XCl or Br) and it is suggested that these features might be from previously unreported states of the phosphorus dihalides (PCl2 and PBr2). For both PCl3 and PBr3, we observe an excitation that is resonant with the 248 nm laser line which shows a progression with a spacing of 387±5 and 140±10 cm-1, respectively. This is attributed to 248 nm excitation of a vibrationally excited species created in a ground or low-lying electronic state by 248 nm photolysis. For PBr3, we suggest that the pumped state could either be the A′ state of Br2 or else the ground state of PBr2 where the observed separation would correspond to the bending frequency, ν2. For PCl3, we can discount excitation of PCl2 and there is not previously reported state of PCl or Cl2 that can be involved. © 1994.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21344486645

Second, plant physiological process models characterize resource use and partitioning, particularly net carbon gain, at the plant and stand scales. Regression residuals from empirical spatial models were analysed to define regional factors - including geomorphology and geology, drainage basin configurations, summer seasonal solar radiation, snow potential and soil moisture potential - affecting model performance. The two modelling approaches offer different perspectives on vegetation pattern that can be integrated for complementary, multiscale analyses linking pattern and process at the alpine treeline ecotone.

In order to minimize the environmental impact of purging, it is vital that purge rates should be set at the lowest level consistent with safe operations. The methods which are currently available for determining these minimum rates are empirical and may be overly conservative; therefore, it is important to develop a more robust basis on which to calculate the required gas flows. To this end, a reduced-scale Rayleigh-scattering investigation of purging flows has yielded two-dimensional concentration maps for a range of purge rates and crosswind velocities.

(+44-734) 723030, United Kingdom","A range of alumina-supported platinum catalysts have been prepared and investigated for the selective reduction of nitrogen monoxide in the presence of a large excess of oxygen. Steady-state microreactor experiments have demonstrated that these catalysts are very active and selective for the reduction of nitrogen monoxide by propene at temperatures as low as 200°C. There does not appear to be a simple correlation between the activity for nitrogen monoxide reduction and the platinum surface area. Instead it is found that there is a very good inverse correlation between the maximum nitrogen monoxide reduction activity and the temperature. The most active catalysts for selective nitrogen monoxide reduction are those that generate activity at the lowest temperature. The technique of temporal analysis of products (TAP) has been used to obtain detailed mechanistic data about the selective nitrogen monoxide reduction reaction on an alumina-supported platinum catalyst. Using carbon monoxide, hydrogen or propene as reductant it has been demonstrated that the predominant mechanism for selective nitrogen monoxide reduction involves the decomposition of nitrogen monoxide on reduced platinum metal sites, followed by the regeneration of the active platinum sites by the reductant. In the decomposition step it has been shown that oxygen from nitrogen monoxide is retained on the surface of the platinum and blocks the surface for further adsorption/reaction of nitrogen monoxide; it has been observed that oxidised platinum catalysts are not active for the nitrogen monoxide reduction reaction. Under typical operating conditions, propene is a far more efficient reductant than either carbon monoxide or hydrogen. The greater efficiency of propene as a reductant is explained on the basis of the additional reducing power of the propene molecule, which can react with as many as nine adsorbed oxygen atoms, ensuring that 'patches' of reduced platinum are available for nitrogen monoxide adsorption/reaction. A small additional activity of reduced platinum in the presence of propene, which is not observed when carbon monoxide or hydrogen is used as reductant, has been explained on the basis of a second mechanism involving the carbon-assisted decomposition of nitrogen monoxide at sites on the reduced platinum adjacent to adsorbed carbon-containing moieties, believed to be fragments from adsorbed propene molecules. A model for the selective reduction of nitrogen monoxide on alumina-supported platinum catalysts is presented which is capable of explaining all the results obtained in this work and in the published literature on this subject. © 1994.","Lean-burn engines; Mechanism; Nitric oxide reduction; NOx; Platinum/alumina; Temporal analysis of products","Adsorption; Alumina; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Catalyst supports; Decomposition; Hydrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Platinum; Propylene; Reduction; Thermal effects; Nitrogen monoxide; Reductant; Temporal analysis of products; Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028466917

CARB emissions standards are already in place, as shown in Table 1, while EPA is still considering legislation. Overhead valve (OHV) engines and those near the upper end of the power limit for small engines, 18.6 kW (25 horsepower), will be able to meet these new regulations much easier than the lower power engines and those of side valve design. Side valve, or L-head engines, have relatively higher emissions levels and will require a greater effort to meet regulations. One of the reasons that L-head engines produce higher levels of exhaust emissions is due to relatively high combustion chamber surface-to-volume ratios compared to OHV engine combustion chambers. There are also areas in the combustion chamber that have difficulty sustaining a flame front and hence, combustion is quenched before burning all of the fuel/air mixture. This results in high hydrocarbon (HC) production. This work was conducted, using Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) internal research funding, to improve HC emissions by optimizing combustion chamber shape. Tests were performed on a 3 kW (4.0 hp), single-cylinder, air-cooled, L-head gasoline engine using special instrumentation to determine flame front arrival at the edges of the combustion chamber.

This formation consists of horizontally bedded alluvial sediments, represented by light gray, coarse- to fine-grained quartz sand, with cross-bedding marked by ochre, red and pink alteration, and to a minor extent by marsh deposits, represented by laminated and spotted shale. The typical topography consists of mesas north of the left margin of the Orinoco River (the Musinacio and Mapire Mesas). To the north of the mesas there is a topography of low hills covered by blocks of ferruginous crusts. A typical tropical savanna climate exists in the region, with a strong dry season which lasts 4-6 months, followed by a rainy season with excess humidity. The dominant erosional process is scarp retreat, due to the action of the savanna climate on the lithology of the partly unconsolidated sediments; it has formed deep canyons in the headwaters, and is magnified by tectonic uplift and the lowering of the regional base level. However, some topographic forms have been preserved due to the hardening of the sands by iron oxides.

Upon cessation of oscillations and return of light or CO2 to the stable median level, stomatal conductance also returned to a steady state, matching that before oscillations were initiated.

The purpose of these teams is to employ comprehensive data sets on projects aimed at improving our subsurface predictive capability. The results are predictive techniques which address and mitigate exploration and exploitation risks. In production, for example, a high resolution sequence stratigraphic framework has been modelled for the Cormorant Field using 2D fluid flow simulation and these have then been compared with traditional lithostratigraphic correlations. Predictive benefits are quantifiable and substantiated by reservoir experience. In the Viking Graben most remaining exploration potential is within deep (> 3500 m) high pressure, high temperature Jurassic traps. By isolating the main controls on reservoir quality, namely: facies, pore fluid type, pressure history and sedimentary provenance, the areas of highest remaining deep potential may be identified. The work has provided a hierarchy of the controls on reservoir quality in the North Sea. In the Central North Sea, an area underlain by mobile salt, defective top seal and fault seal limit Jurassic entrapment. An important pre-requisite to understanding fault and bed seal properties is accurate definition of the hydrocarbon system using pressure and geochemical data, together with regional carrier bed maps. Mechanical trap failure via hydraulic fracturing occurs at high pore pressures where the effective stress approaches zero. It is at this time, additional stresses due to buoyant salt forces affect the seal, the entire hydrocarbon charge may be lost. Predicting such sites requires accurate pressure prediction and stratigraphic forecast together with a measure of late strain across the closure. By combining specialist skills with local basin expertise and building an accurate quality-controlled database, the processes governing hydrocarbon movement, trapping and producibility can be recognized and quantified. The anticipated result is improved drilling success. © 1994 The Executive Board of the World Petroleum Congress Published by John Wiley & Sons.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054385393

In the USA, OSHA is responsible for enforcing regulations concerning personal exposure to toxic substances in the workplace. There are regulations or permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) for at least 50 compounds which can be considered as inorganic gases and vapours. The development or evaluation of numerous sampling and analytical methods for inorganic gases and vapours has been stimulated by the need to determine compliance with these PELs. The validation of a sampling method for OSHA use requires extensive testing within a laboratory setting and, if possible, field studies to assure effectiveness. This paper includes a summary of some of the sampling techniques used for inorganic gases and vapours, and an example of a field test evaluating commercially available products for mercury sampling. Classical sampling methods for OSHA compliance purposes are discussed as well as new approaches such as impregnated carbon bead or passive monitors. In addition, a sampling system which captures both the vapour and the particulate phase is currently in use. Sampling systems and the effect moisture (or lack of it) has on collection of some inorganic gases and vapours is discussed. A sampling strategy employing detector tubes is also included.

On behalf of the Engine Manufacturers Association, emissions from a Detroit Diesel Corporation Series 60 at local test conditions (barometer 98.9 kPa), and two simulated altitudes, Denver (82.6 kPa) and Mexico City (77.9 kPa) were examined using a special altitude simulation CVS. Transient torque output and full load steady-state torque, for this turbocharged aftercooled engine, decreased slightly with increasing altitude. Although, the DDC Series 60 compensates for variation in barometer, transient composite emissions of HC, CO, CO2, smoke, and particulate matter generally increased with increasing altitude for both transient and steady-state operation. No significant change in transient composite NOx emissions with altitude was noted during transient testing, but NOx emissions slightly decreased with increasing altitude for steady-state operation. Peak smoke opacity determined in the snap-smoke test procedure increased approximately 80 percent when apparent barometric pressure was decreased from 98.9 kPa to 77.9 kPa.

We found that similar VOC species were present in commutes and in office except that chloroform and 1,1,1-trichloroethane were only present in offices. The in-vehicle VOC concentrations in Taipei were about 2-30-times higher than the levels in many western cities. The VOC concentrations in commute varied only with different commuting vehicles. The in-vehicle VOC concentrations were not affected by either time-of-day or route-of-traffic.

An indirect approach was adopted to estimate vehicular emission exposure to Guanzhou bicycle commuters. Four bus routes were selected as typical commuting routes. Concentrations of NOx and CO as well as traffic volume, vehicle speed, ground-level wind speed, and direction were measured at monitoring points set up along the routes of typical street links passing through areas of various land uses. CO and NOx were recognized to be two major vehicular emission pollutants. The average CO exposure levels of Guangzhou bicycle commuters ranged from 3.7 μL/L to 8.2 μL/L. Few CO samples exceeded the Chinese national assessment standard. No adverse effect on health was expected. The average NOx exposure levels of Guangzhou bicycle commuters ranged from 0.13 μL/L to 0.26 μL/L. More than half of the NOx samples exceeded the Chinese national assessment standard.

Intracellular recording and stimulation were made from guinea pig trigeminal motoneurons (TMNs) in brain stem slices. Electrophysiological properties were examined and the underlying currents responsible for motoneuron excitability were investigated by the use of current clamp and single electrode voltage clamp (SEVC) techniques. 2. The voltage responses to subthreshold hyperpolarizing or depolarizing current pulses showed voltage- and time-dependent inward rectification. SEVC analysis demonstrated that the hyperpolarizing inward rectification resulted from the development of a slowly occurring voltage-dependent inward current activated at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. This current persisted in solutions containing low Ca2+/Mn2+, tetraethylammonium (TEA), and Ba2+, whereas it was reduced by 1-3 mM cesium. The depolarizing inward rectification was mediated by a persistent sodium current (I(Na-P)) that was completely abolished by bath application of tetrodotoxin (TTX). 3. Action potential characteristics were studied by intracellular stimulation with brief current pulses (&lt;3 ms) in combination with ionic substitutions or application of specific ionic conductance blocking agents. Bath application of TTX abolished the action potential, whereas 1-10 mM TEA or 0.5-2 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) increased, significantly, the spike duration, suggesting participation of the delayed rectifier and A-current type conductances in spike repolarization. SEVC analysis revealed a TEA-sensitive sustained outward current and a fast, voltage-dependent, transient current with properties consistent with their roles in spike repolarization. 4. TMN afterhyperpolarizing potentials (AHPs) that followed a single spike consisted of fast and slow components usually separated by a depolarizing hump [afterdepolarization (ADP)]. The fast component was abolished by TEA or 4-AP but not by Mn2+, Co2+, or the bee venom apamin. In contrast, the slow AHP was readily reduced by Mn2+, Co2+, or apamin, suggesting participation of an apamin-sensitive, calcium- dependent K+ conductance in the production of the slow AHP. SEVC analysis and ionic substitutions demonstrated a slowly activating and deactivating calcium-dependent K+ current with properties that could account for the slow AHP observed in these neurons. 5. Repetitive discharge was examined with long depolarizing current pulses (1 s) and analysis of frequency-current plots. When evoked from resting potential (about -55 mV), spike onset from rheobase occurred rapidly and was maintained throughout the current pulse. At higher current intensities, early and late adaptations in spike discharge were observed. Frequency-current plots exhibited a bilinear relationship for the first interspike interval (ISI) in ~50% of the neurons tested and in most neurons tested during steady-state discharge (SS). The mean slopes for the first ISI of the primary and secondary range firings were 56 and 117 Hz/nA and 16 Hz/nA for the primary range during SS discharge. 6. Bath application of inorganic calcium channel blockers (Mn2+, Co2+) or apamin increased the maximum SS frequency and slope of the frequency-current plots for all neurons tested, suggesting a role for a calcium-dependent K+ conductance in control of repetitive discharge. 7. The present study indicates that intrinsic cellular properties, in addition to timing of synaptic inputs, must be considered when discussing the factors that control motoneuronal excitability and burst-pattern formation during jaw movements.",,"animal tissue; article; electrophysiology; guinea pig; jaw movement; motoneuron; nerve excitability; nerve potential; nonhuman; priority journal; trigeminal nerve",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028158778

A linear programming modeling framework is developed for the three electricity regions of India (western, southern, and northern) for different emission reduction levels for the four pollutants CO2, SO2, NOx, and fly ash.

The results provide a methodical basis for optimization of optics and artifact reduction.

In the model, the PEPcase-dependent C4-cycle was described in terms of CO2 concentration in the mesophyll space using Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the activity of PEPcase was related to the incident PAR to take account of the influence of light on the activity of C4-cycle processes. The CO2 refixation by Rubisco in the bundle sheath was described using a widely accepted C3 photosynthesis model. The model assumes a steady state balance among CO2 diffusion from surrounding atmosphere into the mesophyll space, CO2 transport into the bundle sheath by the C4-cycle, CO2 refixation by the C3-cycle in the bundle sheath, and CO2 leakage from the bundle sheath. The response to temperature of photosynthesis was incorporated via the temperature dependence of model parameters. The photosynthesis model was coupled with a stomatal conductance model in order to predict leaf photosynthesis rates at different atmospheric conditions. The empirical model of Ball et al. (1987) was adopted and slightly modified to describe responses in stomatal conductance. The coupled model was parameterized for the C4 grass Andropogon gerardii grown in both ambient (350 ppm) and elevated (700 ppm) CO2 atmospheres. The key parameters of the model were estimated by fitting the model to the measured data using non-linear regression. The model was validated by comparison the predicted photosynthetic response to PAR in both CO2-pretreatments with the measured data from an independent gas exchange experiment. The predicted photosynthesis and stomatal conductance matched the measured data quite well for both atmospheric CO2-pretreatments. At 25°C, the estimated maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco Vcm,25, potential electron transport rate Jm,25 and quantum efficiency α were increased by CO2 enrichment. The maximum PEPcase activity Vpm,25 was lower in elevated CO2. The model predicted that the light-saturated leaf photosynthesis will increase by about 10% with the rising of atmospheric CO2 from 350 to 700 ppm at 30°C, and that the optimal temperature of photosynthesis will shift from 37 to 38.5°C. The estimated slope of the stomatal conductance model was increased by atmospheric CO2 enrichment. Stomatal conductance was significantly reduced by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. © 1994.","Andropogon gerardii; C4 grass; CO2 enrichment; Photosynthesis; Stomatal conductance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028150234

The experimental arrangement uses a 7-ns 266-nm light pulse to populate the lowest 4f5d state, and a spatially overlapped, time-sequenced pulse from a frequency-tunable dye laser to induce transitions from that excited state. The excited-state-absorption (ESA) spectrum covering the 900-300-nm probe wavelength range is characterized by two broad peaks centered at 700 and 350 nm on a slowly rising background. The peak ESA cross section at 355 nm is (1±0.1)×10-17 cm2. The position, shape, and strength of the spectrum suggest that the terminal states of the ESA transitions are the second 4f5d state of Pr3+ and the conduction band of the host lattice. The ESA measurements have been extended to transitions from the 3P0 and 1D2 excited states of the 4f2 configuration of Pr3+ as well.

The angular resolution and spatial coverage of our survey are compatible with the existing CO (J = 1 → 0) survey of this region by Sanders et al., which we use for comparison. We identify 34 molecular clouds in our map region; their relationships between size and line width and between virial mass and luminosity are consistent with the relationships seen in CO (J = 1 → 0) emission. However, we note that previous studies have shown considerable variation in these relationships; we attribute much of this variation to differences in their cloud definition algorithm and statistical method. We find that the median ratio of integrated emission in the two lowest CO transitions for the clouds in our sample is I(2 → 1)/ I(1 → 0) = 0.69, implying that the typical emitting region in the line of sight contains cold gas that is not actively star-forming. Our conclusion that the molecular ring emission is not dominated by star-forming regions is consistent with other large-scale studies of the Milky Way. Our distributions of cloud size and temperature also imply that relatively massive molecular clouds that lack star formation, such as Maddalena's cloud, are not rare in the inner Galaxy.","Galaxy: structure; ISM: clouds; ISM: molecules; Radio lines: ISM; Stars: formation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044257151

However, the mechanisms accounting for the reduction of gastric mucosal blood flow have not been defined. The current study aimed to test the hypothesis that decrease of gastric mucosal blood flow in rats is the result of changes of systematic blood pressure and/or platelet aggregation. 5-HT (given i.p. 5 or 10 mg/kg) time and dose dependently reduced gastric mucosal blood flow and systematic arterial blood pressure; it also potentiated ethanol-induced mucosal damage. Methysergide (a 5-HT2-receptor blocker) pretreatment alleviated the decrease of gastric mucosal blood flow and lesion formation but not the systemic blood pressure. Also in the 5-HT-treated animals, the mucosal oxygen (O2) and haemoglobin levels as well as the systematic blood CO2 were reduced, but the blood O2 was increased. The latter two parameters correlated with an elevation of the respiratory rate. The blood platelet count was not affected by 5-HT pretreatment. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) dose dependently induced a similar degree of platelet aggregation in platelet rich plasma fractions in the saline and 5-HT-treated rats in vitro. 5-HT in the concentrations of 1 or 10 μM, promoted the platelet aggregation produced by ADP. However, this action was attenuated in the 5-HT-pretreated rats, indicating that tachyphylaxis of 5-HT action on platelet aggregation could occur. It is concluded that the depression of gastric mucosal blood flow by 5-HT is caused by the decrease of systemic blood pressure and gastric vascular constriction but not by the induction of platelet aggregation in vivo. © 1994.","5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin); Adenosine diphosphate; Blood gas; Blood pressure; Gastric mucosal blood flow; Methysergide; Platelet aggregation","adenosine diphosphate; alcohol; carbon dioxide; hemoglobin; methysergide; oxygen; serotonin; animal cell; animal experiment; arterial pressure; article; blood gas; breathing rate; concentration response; controlled study; dose time effect relation; drug antagonism; drug potentiation; hemodynamics; intraperitoneal drug administration; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; stomach mucosa blood flow; stomach mucosa lesion; subcutaneous drug administration; thrombocyte aggregation; vasoconstriction; Adenosine Diphosphate; Animal; Blood Gas Analysis; Blood Pressure; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Ethanol; Gastric Mucosa; Hemodynamics; Injections, Intraperitoneal; Male; Methysergide; Platelet Aggregation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Regional Blood Flow; Respiration; Serotonin; Stomach Ulcer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028294430

If local mixture is too rich or lean, incomplete combustion occurs. This can play a major role in unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. Fuel-air mixture distribution depends on in-cylinder swirl and turbulence and is directly related to intake manifold configuration, fuel delivery system design and combustion chamber shape. Understanding the spatial mixture distribution may help improve the design of these aforementioned components. Consequently, a more complete combustion process may result, and emissions reduced. A method that measures the emission of CH and C2 radicals via the use of an optical fiber bundle was used in this research to map the mixture uniformity in the combustion chamber. The intensity ratio (I C2/ICH) was correlated to the fuel-air equivalence ratio. The mixture distribution measured was then correlated with the hydrocarbon emission sequence. The exhaust gas was sampled by a port mounted sampling valve and analyzed by a FID. Two fuels, propane and Indolene, were used with a Tecumseh horizontal shaft L-head engine. For both fuels, high hydrocarbon emissions early in the exhaust process were identified as resulting from locally overrich mixture in the valve region of the chamber. For propane, the hydrocarbon content of the gases leaving the cylinder last, was independent of mixture distribution and was likely due to wall quenching. On the other hand, for Indolene, mixture mal-distribution was found to contribute to the hydrocarbon emission late in the exhaust process. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air engines; Air intakes; Carbon monoxide; Combustion chambers; Combustors; Cylinder configurations; Diesel engines; Engine cylinders; Fuels; Mixtures; Optical fibers; Propane; Carbon monoxide emissions; Combustion chamber shape; Fuel-air equivalence ratio; Fuel-delivery systems; Hydrocarbon emission; Incomplete combustion; Mixture distributions; Unburned hydrocarbons; Gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072417815

In this study, we use collocated AVHRR and ERBE measurements from the same satellite in order to understand the effect of cloud optical properties on the radiative balance ofthe earth-atmosphere system. © 1994 SPIE.",,"Atmospheric radiation; Climate change; Particle size; Remote sensing; Tropics; Cloud optical depth; Cloud optical properties; Cloud radiative forcing; Global climate changes; Information concerning; Radiative energy balance; Radiative interactions; Science objectives; Optical properties",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076798495

We therefore aimed to quantify total and regional deposition of nebulized aerosol in children of widely differing age. Twelve infants (median age 0.8 yrs, range 0.3-1.4 yrs) who were asleep, and eight older children (median age 10.8 yrs, range 6.3-18.0 yrs) with cystic fibrosis were studied. Radiolabelled normal saline aerosol was generated by a Turret nebolizer, with a driving now of 9 l min-1. All subjects inhaled aerosol via the nasal route, whilst the older children undertook a second study with inhalation via the oral route. Following aerosol inhalation, planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans were obtained. For the nasal route, total lung deposition was lower in infants (median 1.3%, range 0.3-1.6%) than in older children (median 2.7%, range 1.6-4.4%). For the older children inhaling via the nasal or oral route, there was no influence of age on lung, upper respiratory tract, or the sum of upper respiratory tract and lung deposition. We conclude that the dose of a nasally inspired aerosol reaching the longs of infants who are asleep is approximately half that for older children, when the nebulizer is operating at 9 l min-1. Age does not affect deposition of nasally or orally inspired aerosols in older children.","Aerosol deposition; Age; Children","antibiotic agent; adolescent; aerosol; age; article; child; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; cystic fibrosis; drug administration; drug therapy; female; forced expiratory volume; human; infant; male; priority journal; Administration, Inhalation; Administration, Oral; Aerosols; Age Factors; Child; Cystic Fibrosis; Female; Humans; Infant; Lung; Male; Sodium Chloride; Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028566346

Similarly sequences of recharge to an unconfined aquifer in eastern England were the basis of deriving its yield/storage behaviour. Then, taking scenarios of the year 2030 rainfall and evaporation, provided by the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, reductions in yield were calculated to be 5–15% below present‐day values. For direct supply reservoirs, greater percentage reductions in yield were found to apply to the south‐east region, as compared to the north‐west. The results from the aquifer example are interpreted on a novel basis which allows an immediate comparison with the surface reservoir examples. Coastal sea‐water intrusion was modelled for three common geological conditions (i) the Grimsby Chalk (confined), (ii) the Brighton Chalk (unconfined), and (hi) the Otter Valley Sandstone (unconfined). In all three cases the effect of a possible 0.6 m rise in mean sea level was shown to have only a marginal effect on sustainable yields, which reduced by about 1.5%. Estuarine fresh‐salt water interfaces are important to the abstraction regime of freshwater intakes in the lower reaches of rivers. The effect of a 0.6‐m sea‐level rise on the saline interface location at high tide was evaluated by hydrodynamic computational models. Only a minor inland shin of the interface was found, less man 800 m in the Thames tideway and less than 500 m in the Lune estuary. The Severn estuary is exceptional in having its saline interface move 3.5 km landwards for the same 0.6‐m rise in mean sea level. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

Strain PCC 7942 is deprived of an essential macronutrient such as nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorus, cellular phycobiliprotein and chlorophyll contents decline. The level of β-carotene declines proportionately to chlorophyll, but the level of zeaxanthin increases relative to chlorophyll. In nitrogen- or sulfur-deprived cells there is a net degradation of phycobiliproteins. Otherwise, the declines in cellular pigmentation are due largely to the diluting effect of continued cell division after new pigment synthesis ceases and not to net pigment degradation. There was also a rapid decrease in O2 evolution when Synechococcus sp. Strain PCC 7942 was deprived of macronutrients. The rate of O2 evolution declined by more than 90% in nitrogen- or sulfur-deprived cells, and by approximately 40% in phosphorus-deprived cells. In addition, in all three cases the fluorescence emissions from Photosystem II and its antennae were reduced relative to that of Photosystem I and the remaining phycobilisomes. Furthermore, state transitions were not observed in cells deprived of sulfur or nitrogen and were greatly reduced in cells deprived of phosphorus. Photoacoustic measurements of the energy storage capacity of photosynthesis also showed that Photosystem II activity declined in nutrient-deprived cells. In contrast, energy storage by Photosystem I was unaffected, suggesting that Photosystem I-driven cyclic electron flow persisted in nutrient-deprived cells. These results indicate that in the modified photosynthetic apparatus of nutrient-deprived cells, a much larger fraction of the photosynthetic activity is driven by Photosystem I than in nutrient-replete cells. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","cyanobacteria; cyclic photophosphorylation; nutrient deprivation; photoacoustic spectroscopy; photoinhibition; Photosystem I",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028251852

Material was selected from coals, paper coals, coal balls, oil-shales and shales and included cuticles from stems and leaves, periderm from stems and rooting systems, spore walls, algal cell walls and 'resin' rodlets. Chemical analyses were undertaken using Curie-point pyrolysis-gas chromatography (-mass spectrometry) (Py-GC-(MS)) and 13C solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to ensure a detailed understanding of the plant material which was analysed chemically. This study has emphasized those plants, plant tissues and organs which are known to have been dominant or major contributors to Carboniferous coals and coal-bearing sequences: arborescent lycophyte periderm (Diaphorodendron stems and Stigmaria rhizomorphs); pteridosperm cuticles (medullosan (e.g. Alethopteris) and Karinopteris), lycophyte stem cuticle (Eskdalia) and arborescent lycophyte spores (megaspores and microspores). Several algal cell walls (Tetraedron, Tasmanites and Gloeocapsomorpha) and the 'resin' rodlets derived from medullosan pteridosperm petioles have also been analysed. Results show that all of these elements (except resins) contain (or are dominated by) highly resistant, highly aliphatic macromolecules which have the potential to yield, upon catagenesis, n-alkanes which are found in crude oils. Resins potentially contribute cyclic hydrocarbons to crude oils. Combining all this evidence it is concluded that Carboniferous coals are oil prone and that explanations for the absence of oil-pools derived from such coals must be sought in geological or exploration factors and not in the nature of the coals themselves. A review of coal-forming floras through time, and of suggested terrestrially sourced oils and their parent coals, leads us to conclude that high molecular weight components of higher plant materials have potentially made a major contribution to oils sourced from coals and coal-bearing strata over a long period of geological time (Devonian onwards). Cell walls of freshwater algae have made a comparable contribution since the Ordovician. The oil-generating potential of each coal or organic-rich sediment will depend upon a combination of depositional environment and the floristic and chemical composition of the source vegetation and its component plants and plant parts. © 1994 The Geological Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042167908

These emissions are caused by filamentous algae (Cladophora spp., Enteromorpha spp.) which accumulate on the downwind shores, and decay under anoxic conditions. On-site pilot experiments were used to test the effectiveness of two methods of controlling H2S emissions: Harvesting the shoreline accumulation of filamentous algae and the use of a barrier (“phytofence”) to prevent accumulation of algae onshore. Replicate experimental plots were set up along a portion of the downwind (east) shore. Atmospheric H2S concentrations above the phytofence plots were significantly lower than above both control and harvest plots. In addition, total dissolved sulfide was significantly lower and dissolved oxygen significantly higher in the phytofence plots than in control and harvest plots. Thus, a phytofence may be a viable method for reducing H2S emissions. Harvest plot H2S emissions, total dissolved sulfide, and dissolved oxygen concentrations were not significantly different from control plots. Removal of filamentous algae to significantly reduce the H2S emissions is impractical early in the season due to large amounts of algae involved and the difficulty of harvesting; it is impossible later in the season because of the decomposed state of the algae. Harvesting is not a viable method for reducing H2S emissions from these evaporation ponds. © 1994 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Filamentous algae; Harvesting; Hydrogen sulfide; Phytofence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952515145

The N-terminal half of the ADR1 protein was shown to contain three separate transactivation domains, including one (TADI) that encompasses the zinc finger DNA-binding domain. While TADII and TADIII were shown to be functionally redundant in activating ADH2 expression, deletion of only TADIII impaired ADR1 control of glycerol metabolism genes. None of these activation domains appeared to be carbon source regulated when separated from the ADH2 promoter context. Interspersed among these activation domains were two regions which, when removed, increased ADR1 activity; one was localized to the site of ADR1(c) mutations (residues 227 to 239) that allow glucose-insensitive ADH2 expression. The 227-to-239 region blocked ADR1 activity independently of the TAD present on ADR1, ADR1 DNA binding, and specific ADH2 promoter sequences. In addition, this region inhibited the function of a heterologous transcriptional activator. These results are consistent with the existence of an extragenic factor that binds the ADR1(c) region and represses ADR1 activity and suggest that other factors are responsible for aiding ADR1 in the carbon source regulation of ADH2.",,"glycerol; transcription factor; article; DNA binding; DNA transcription; gene control; gene deletion; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; repressor gene; transactivation; yeast",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028012045

In general, these guidelines recommend or require the use of upperbound “point” estimates for numerous exposure parameters. This methodology yields a single risk estimate, which is intended not to underestimate the true risk and may significantly overstate it. This paper describes a risk assessment of a facility’s airborne emissions using a probabilistic approach, which presents a range and distribution of risk estimates rather than a single point estimate. The health risks to residents living near a food processing facility, as estimated using techniques recommended by California AB2588, are compared to the results of a probabilistic analysis. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) were identified as the emitted chemicals of concern. The point estimate method recommended by CAPCOA resulted in estimates that were greater than the 99.99th percentile risk predicted by the probabilistic analysis. As shown in other assessments of persistent airborne chemicals, secondary or indirect exposure pathways (i.e., ingestion of beef, ingestion of cow’s milk, and ingestion of mother’s milk) ratherthan inhalation, were the greatest contributors to risk. In this analysis, the probability distributions for the cancer potency factor and ingestion of cow’s milk had the largest impact on the results of the 33 exposure factors considered. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; air pollution; article; cancer risk; environmental exposure; environmental protection; food processing; health hazard; health status; human; milk; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028657604

Our total sample consists of 79 objects that are well matched in luminosity and redshift, which should allow unbiased comparison of their spectral properties. We confirm recent results that radio-loud objects have, on average, narrower and stronger C IV γ1549 and C III] γ1909 emission lines than radio-quiet objects. This is likely the effect of larger average intermediate-line and/or narrow-line regions in radio loud objects, including a relative excess of emission on very extended (∼100 kpc) scales. We additionally find that radio-loud objects show a significantly wider range in the asymmetry of the C IV γ1549 profile than radio-quiet objects, with cases of both redward and blueward asymmetry. By contrast, radio-quiet objects almost exclusively show blueward asymmetry in this line, and cases of strong redward asymmetry appear to be limited to steep-spectrum objects. Statistically, there is a closer correspondence between the emission-line properties of radio-quiet and flat-spectrum objects than between either of these subclasses and steep-spectrum objects, whose mean emission-line properties differ strongly from those of the radio-quiet sample. This result is similar to that found for the properties of the optical emission lines in low-redshift objects and is not easily understood under the proposed unified models of the flat- and steep-spectrum sources. We also find that 20%-30% of radio-loud objects show narrow (∼1000 km s-1) emission in He II γ1640. No cases of such emission are found among radio-quiet objects.

These 1 to 3 cm-thick ironstone layers formed at about the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary during rapid sea-level rise, which began about 16,000 years ago and within about 8000 years brought the bottom of the shelf from a water depth of less than 30-100 m or more. A rapid vertical transition from circalittoral deposits characterized by a coastal detritic community with calcareous algae to ironstones rich in iron-managanese pisoids or glaucony and containing planktonic foraminifera, siliceous sponge spicules and echinoderm remains, indicates sediment starvation during rapid drowning of the shelf. The crisis of the sedimentary system and the local ironstone formation at sites of favourable morphology were triggered by major paleogeographic changes during final deglaciation at the close of the Pleistocene, leading to modified circulation patterns and chemistry of sea-water, reduced carbonate productivity below the photic zone, and strong activity of northward-directed Tyrrhenian currents intruding onto the outer shelf. Abundance of organic matter transported from the drowned volcanic islands and diminished oxygenation, due to both increasing water-depth and sluggish vertical circulation, were responsible for local reducing micro-environments, as testified by the formation of pyrite, leaching of carbonate bioclasts, and growth of microbial mats. Offshore sedimentation did not resume until the last 2000-4000 years, when the deeper-water and finer-grained Ponza glauconitic ironstone was covered by a thin veneer of silty clay deposited on the uppermost slope, beneath the mudline. The shallower and coarser-grained Ventotene winnowed pisoidal hardground, instead, is probably still forming today under the action of strong northward directed marine currents sweeping the shelfbreak free of sediment. © 1994.",,"ferriferous hardground; ironstone; ironstone formation; palaeobiology; Pleistocene/Holocene hiatus; Pleistocene/Holocene hiatuses; sea water chemistry; seawater chemistry; sedimentary environments; shelfbreak; sulphate reduction; Italy, Pontian Islands; Tyrrhenian Sea, Pontian Islands Margin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028254349

To determine proportions of platform origin and of plankton origin of carbonate mud, two reference sediments were collected: (1) back-reef carbonate mud from the Young Reef area (Great Barrier Reef); and (2) Late Miocene chalk from the Loyalty Basin, off New Caledonia. Through their biofacies and mineralogical and geochemical characters, these reference sediments were used to distinguish the proportions of platform and basin components in carbonate muds of 25 core samples from Hole 817A. Two ""origin indexes"" (i1 and i2) relate the proportion in platform and basin materials. The relative sedimentation rate is inferred from the high-frequency cycles determined by redox intervals in the cores. Bulk carbonate deposited in each core has been calculated in two ways with close results: (1) from calcimetric data available in the Leg 133 preliminary reports (Davies et al., 1991); and (2) from average magnetic susceptibility of cores, a value negatively correlated to the average carbonate content. Vertical changes in sedimentation rates, in carbonate content, in origin indexes and in ""linear fluxes"" document the evolution of sediment origins from platform carbonates, planktonic carbonates and insoluble material through time. These data are augmented with the variations in organic-matter content through the 817A succession. The observed changes and their interpretation are not modified by compaction, and are compatible with major paleogeographic events including drowning of the Queensland Plateau (Middle Miocene-Early Pliocene) and the renewal of shallow carbonate production, (1) during the Late Pliocene, and (2) from the Early Pleistocene. The birth and growth of the Great Barrier Reef is also recorded from 0.5 Ma by a strengthening of detrital carbonate deposition and possibly by a lack of clay minerals in the 4 upper cores, a response to trapping of terrigenous material behind this barrier. In addition, a maximum of biological silica production is displayed in the Middle Miocene. These changes constrain the time of events and the sequence-stratigraphy framework some components of which are transgression surface, maximum flooding surface and low-stand turbidites. Sedimentation rates and material fluxes show cycles lasting 1.75 Myr. Whatever their origin (climatic and/or eustatic) these cycles affected the planktonic production primarily. The changes also show that major carbonate variations in the deposits are due to a dilution effect by insoluble material (clay, biogenic silica and volcanic glasses) and that plankton productivity, controlling the major fraction of carbonate sedimentation, depends principally on terrigenous supplies, but also on deep-water upwelling. Accuracy of the method is reduced by redeposition, reworking, and probable occurrence of hiatuses. © 1994.",,"Cainozoic; carbonate platform; carbonate sediments; palaeoenvironments; palaeogeography; provenance; sedimentation; Australia, Queensland; Coral Sea, Townsville Basin, ODP Site 817; Pacific, Townsville Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028582939

The two regions are very closely matched in terms of their Mediterranean‐type climates, landforms, soil types and disturbance regimes. On both continents, matched sites on all substrata (siliceous sand, quartzite, laterite, limestone and calcareous sand) support sclerophyllous shrublands with a similar mix of growth forms. Soils from all substrata in both Australia and South Africa are extremely nutrient‐poor except for the calcareous sands where high levels of phosphorus were recorded. Contrary to expectations, Australian soils are not generally less fertile than their South African counterparts. The frequency of species in different leaf consistence categories was similar on the two continents, as was the leaf specific mass of overstorey shrubs from all substrata. Woody plants with leaf spines are significantly more frequent on Australian nutrient‐poor substrata. Among woody plants, species with canopy‐stored seed are significantly more frequent on Australian nutrient‐poor sites, whereas species with bird‐dispersed fruits and inter‐fire germination are significantly more frequent on South African limestone and calcareous sand. There was good evidence for convergence between the two continents in the frequency of other seed biological traits. The study indicates strong convergence between Australian and South African shrublands in the frequency of a wide range of traits relating to plant form and function. Examples of non‐convergence are probably due to regional and historical processes rather than differences in the contemporary physical environments of the two study areas.

Under this paradigm, the measure of compliance will be determined entirely by the costs of compliance, weighed against the probability of being caught in violation multiplied by the consequences of being caught. This supposition is often made without empirical support. This paper presents an empirical analysis of compliance with United States air pollution control regulations. Compliance was obtained from an EPA data base, broken down both by state and by industrial source category, and was analyzed through regression analysis that utilized several economic explanatory variables. The results suggest that corporate ability to pay is a significant factor in explaining compliance. There is some evidence that higher costs reduce compliance, though not so directly as might be expected.

The radiative forcing - the increase in equivalent CO2 concentrations from 1985-2035 specified in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenario A - was identical in all four 50-year integrations. This approach to climate change experiments is called the Monte Carlo technique and is analogous to a similar experimental set-up used in the field of extended range weather forecasting. Despite the limitation of a very small sample size, this approach enables the estimation of both a mean response and the ""between-experiment"" variability, information which is not available from a single integration. The use of multiple realizations provides insights into the stability of the response, both spatially, seasonally and in terms of different climate variables. The results indicate that the time evolution of the global mean warming signal is strongly dependent on the initial state of the climate system. While the individual members of the ensemble show considerable variation in the pattern and amplitude of near-surface temperature change after 50 years, the ensemble mean climate change pattern closely resembles that obtained in a 100-year integration performed with the same model. In global mean terms, the climate change signals for near surface temperature, the hydrological cycle and sea level significantly exceed the variability among the members of the ensemble. Due to the high internal variability of the modelled climate system, the estimated detection time of the global mean temperature change signal is uncertain by at least one decade. While the ensemble mean surface temperature and sea level fields show regionally significant responses to greenhouse-gas forcing, it is not possible to identify a significant response in the precipitation and soil moisture fields, variables which are spatially noisy and characterized by large variability between the individual integrations. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.",,"climate change; GCM; greenhouse effect; greenhouse warming; Monte Carlo method; ocean/atmosphere model; radiative forcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028572823

To further examine the linkage between above- and belowground C and N cycles at elevated CO2, we grew clonally propagated cuttings of Populus grandidentata in the field at ambient and twice ambient CO2 in open bottom root boxes filled with organic matter poor native soil. Nitrogen was added to all root boxes at a rate equivalent to net N mineralization in local dry oak forests. Nitrogen added during August was enriched with 15N to trace the flux of N within the plant-soil system. Above-and belowground growth, CO2 assimilation, and leaf N content were measured non-destructively over 142 d. After final destructive harvest, roots, stems, and leaves were analyzed for total N and 15N. There was no CO2 treatment effect on leaf area, root length, or net assimilation prior to the completion of N addition. Following the N addition, leaf N content increased in both CO2 treatments, but net assimilation showed a sustained increase only in elevated CO2 grown plants. Root relative extension rate was greater at elevated CO2, both before and after the N addition. Although final root biomass was greater at elevated CO2, there was no CO2 effect on plant N uptake or allocation. While low soil N availability severely inhibited CO2 responses, high CO2 grown plants were more responsive to N. This differential behavior must be considered in light of the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of soil resources, particularly N which often limits plant growth in temperate forests. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","CO2; gas exchange; nitrogen; Populus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51249168882

The monoclonal antibody anti‐epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr)antibody‐425, against the epidermal growth factor receptor, has the potential to bind specifically to gliomas and not normal brain tissue.1–3 A prospective study was conducted (1986–1988) to evaluate the use of Indium‐111 (111In)‐labeled anti‐EGFr‐425 in the localization of gliomas before radioimmunotherapy with Iodine‐125 (125I)‐labeled anti‐EGFr‐425. Methods. Twenty‐eight patients with intracranial neoplasms were injected intravenously with an average dose of 2.2 mCi 111In‐labeled anti‐EGFr‐425. Planar and single‐photon emission computed tomography scans were performed after 48 and 72 hours. Control studies also were performed in two cases with 111In‐labeled Co 17‐1A (a, *I antibody to colorectal cancer) and in one case with unlabeled 111In chloride. Results. The immunoscintigraphic findings were generally in good agreement with computerized tomographic findings. The definitive diagnosis was established by biopsy findings: 23 gliomas (1 Grade I, 5 Grade II, 6 Grade III, and 11 Grade IV), 1 meningioma, and 4 metastatic lesions. The localization of gliomas with 111In‐labeled anti‐EGF‐425 had a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.60 and an accuracy of 0.90. Conclusion. Immunoscintigraphy with 111‐In labeled anti‐EGFr‐425 can be useful in the management of malignant gliomas, especially before radioimmunotherapy with 125I‐labeled anti‐EGFr‐425. Cancer 1994; 73:884–9.

The principle of steady state diffusion and its application to four limiting cases of practical interest are surveyed. In addition, the combination of a waste body with a surrounding barrier layer is considered. By comparing steady state diffusion to the non-steady situation, its advantage factor can be derived. Similarly, the use of a barrier is defined in terms of an advantage factor.

MVDP mRNA is induced over a period of 24h and maximal induction is about 25-fold. Treatment of cells with cycloheximide completely abolished the observed androgen effect suggesting that the induction of the MVDP gene by androgens depends on continuous protein synthesis.

The acetylene is found to bind quite weakly to the palladium atom and inserts with an activation barrier of 17 kcal mol-1. The geometry of the transition state corresponds to a monohapto coordination of the acetylene. No intermediate seems to be involved on the reaction path, at least for the C2H2 system. The effects of substitution of one hydrogen atom by more electron attracting substituents and of a CH group by a metal organic entity are briefly analysed.

The Energy-Economy model computes total energy use, with a focus on final energy consumption in end-use sectors, based on economic activity levels and the energy conservation potential (""end-use approach""). The Industrial Production and Consumption model computes the future levels of activities other than energy use, which lead to greenhouse gas emissions, based on relations with activities defined in the Energy-Economy model. These two models are complemented by two emissions models, to compute the associated emissions by using emission factors per compound and per activity defined. For investigating energy conservation and emissions control strategy scenarios various techno-economic coefficients in the model can be modified. In this paper the methodology and implementation of the ""Energy-Industry System"" models is described as well as results from their testing against data for the period 1970-1990. In addition, the application of the models is presented for a specific scenario calculation.

The rate is based on the federal test procedure (FTP), which represents typical driving conditions for an urban vehicle trip. In current practice, however, links instead of trips are used to estimate both VMT and many of the travel characteristics needed as inputs to MOBILE. For example average link speeds are provided as input to MOBILE in current practice, although trip speeds might be more appropriate, given the FTP basis of MOBILE emission factors. A different approach to application of emissions factors from MOBILE is presented. The approach is based on trips rather than on links and therefore more consistent with the trip basis used to develop MOBILE's emissions factors. The approach also allows development of data on travel characteristics from travel model output and travel survey data in a straightforward manner and does not require the special efforts to account for missing VMT needed in the link-based approach. However its most important advantage over the link-based approach is that it facilitates estimation of impacts of transportation control measures on non-VMT MOBILE inputs such as cold-start percentages, vehicle mix, and trip length distribution.",,"Environmental protection; Estimation; Mathematical models; Speed; Temperature; Urban planning; Vehicles; Emission factors; Emission rate; Federal test procedure; Transportation control measures; Urban vehicle trip; Vehicle mile of travel; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028531517

In this study the response of the catalyst is measured after step changes in the CO, 13CO and O2 concentration in order to reveal the reaction mechanism and the concentration of active sites. Special attention was given to the behaviour of the catalyst under conditions changing from net oxidization to net reduction, as this is representative for realistic exhaust gas conditions. It was found that the catalyst goes through an oxidation/reduction cycle under these conditions. The activity of the catalyst in an oxidizing gas feed following the reducing gas feed is initially higher than the steady-state activity. The surface reaction is rate determining under oxidizing and reducing conditions, but the removal of CO2 from the catalyst surface also affects the overall rate of the reaction. It is found that 27% of the surface copper is covered with CO and CO2 in a reducing reaction mixture, i.e., 5% CO and 1.5% O2 in He. This amount is 18% in an oxidizing reaction mixture. CO readsorbs rapidly at the catalyst surface, but CO2 which desorbs via a concerted reaction mechanism with O2, hardly readsorbs at the catalyst surface. © 1994.",,"Air pollution control; Alumina; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Catalyst activity; Copper compounds; Desorption; Gas adsorption; Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; Surfaces; Copper chromium oxide; Surface reactions; Catalysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028482126

Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439, United States","For the past twenty years, energy and environmental analysts in the U.S. have been searching for ways to improve urban air quality and make the country less vulnerable to supply and price volatility in the world oil market. To improve urban air quality, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a number of state air-quality agencies favor controls on emissions of non-methane hydrocarbons, which are one of the main contributors to ozone formation, and which are emitted along the entire fuel production-and-use chain, from drilling for oil through oil refining and gasoline marketing, to vehicle tailpipe emissions. To reduce oil consumption, some analysts and policy makers have suggested that the fuel economy of motor vehicles be increased substantially. These policies-to control emissions in order to improve air quality, and to increase fuel economy in order to reduce oil consumption-have always been considered separately in the U.S. In this paper we connect emission reduction policy with fuel-economy-improvement policy. We also examine a related issue: Does the side benefit of lower emissions due to improved fuel economy mean that fuel economy standards should be set even higher? Typically, when analysts estimate how high fuel economy standards should be, they compare the extra costs of efficiency-improving technology (including perhaps such things as reduced safety and performance) with the benefits of reduced fuel consumption. Such cost-benefit analyses have indicated an ""optimal"" level of fuel economy (where benefits balance costs) of between 30 and 40 mpg, depending on assumptions and methods. However, the analyses done to date have not counted the potential reduction in emissions as a benefit of improved fuel economy. We do so here, by assuming that the value of a ton of emissions eliminated by higher fuel economy is equal to the cost of controlling (eliminating) that ton by traditional control means. We find that adding the value of emission reductions to the benefit side of the cost-benefit analysis justifies raising fuel economy standards by an additional one mile per gallon only. © 1994.",,"cost- benefit analysis; emission control; energy efficiency; fuel economy; motor fuel; USA; Air pollution control; Air quality; Automotive fuels; Costs; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Hydrocarbons; Ozone; Public policy; Societies and institutions; Standards; Cost benefit analysis; Emission reduction policy; Motor vehicle fuel economy; Price volatility; Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028665525

With increasing potassium loadings at temperatures where either a deactivating two. dimensional carbon or a filamentary carbon was formed, the catalytic activity passed through a maximum and then decreased. With relatively high K-doses there was less coking in the presence of steam; the growth of filamentary carbon was then largely reduced. Characterization of the coked catalysts by temperature-programmed oxidation and SEM disclosed quite different roles of alkali: at lower contents, associated with alumina, potassium facilitates the formation of filamentary carbon and minimizes the generation of coke precursors, whereas at higher contents it acts as a poison for both hydrogenolysis and coking reactions. In all cases, the alkali promoted the catalytic oxidation of the carbon deposits. Because of its localization, the alkali could also modify the nickel-carbon interface in carbon filaments. © 1994 Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001462898

In the northern hemisphere, domestic heating and the supply of hot water are the cause of a great part of these emissions. This paper presents a discussion of the potential of various compression and absorption heat pump systems for reducing the CO2 emissions. A comparison with cogeneration systems or furnaces is presented. Compared to a standard oil fired furnace, the CO2 emission is only slightly reduced by using a state of the art compression heat pump and electricity from a coal fired power plant. Yet there is a way to reduce emissions significantly even when coal is used as fuel. The combination of coal fired cogeneration plants with compression heat pumps is a very efficient way to decrease the emission level for heating systems. For gas fired absorption heat pumps or engine driven heat pumps the CO2 emission is smaller still. In the future, compression heat pumps can make contribution to CO2 reduction either by using CO2 free or CO2 low electricity, or by improving the COP to values better than 4.0. Some results for different combined heating and refrigeration systems are presented. In this case, advanced absorption cycles or compression-absorption cycles can reduce the CO2 emission by up to 75%, compared to presently used standard systems. © 1994.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Refrigeration; Waste heat utilization; Absorption heat pump systems; Coal fired power plant; Compression heat pumps; Emissions reduction; Heat pump systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028428716

Hourly carbon monoxide and ozone measurements are reported here for the Mace Head site on the Atlantic coast of the Republic of Ireland, for the three-year period from 1990 to 1992. Evidence is found for the advection of air masses containing elevated concentrations of carbon monoxide, from the continent of Europe to the Mace Head site, particularly when the wind flow is easterly and southeasterly. Using the simultaneous measurements of man-made halocarbons and daily wind sector allocations, it has been possible to identify the Northern Hemisphere baseline carbon monoxide concentration at 53 N of 128 ± 4 ppb and show that there has been a significant trend to increasing concentrations over the three-year period amounting to about 0.8 ppb yr-1. The European source strength for carbon monoxide has been quantified as 128 kg head of population yr. in excellent agreement with literature emission inventories. A downward trend in European CO emissions of about 13% yr-1 has been detected, presumably reflecting the steady reduction due to motor vehicle emission regulations. Over the period from March 1987 to December 1992, the continent of Europe has been shown to be a small, net ozone sink of 2.6 2.8 ppb over all of those occasions when European air flowed out over the Atlantic Ocean over Mace Head. A box model analysis of the observed simultaneous summertime carbon monoxide and ozone concentration variations points to between 1.7 and 7 ozone molecules being produced per NOx molecule oxidised. © 1994.","carbon monoxide; emissions; Halocarbons; measurements; methane; ozone","1990-1992; carbon monoxide; measurements; methane; ozone; Ireland, Mace Head; Carbon monoxide; Coastal zones; Mathematical models; Methane; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Wind; Air mass advection; Ground level ozone; Man made halocarbons; Atmospheric composition; carbon monoxide; halocarbon; ozone; air pollution; article; environmental monitoring; ireland; marine environment; photochemistry; pollution control; priority journal; troposphere; wind; Myristica fragrans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028501524

Management of these lands with a wide range of existing, site-specific, integrated, agroforest systems represents a significant global opportunity to reduce the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Establishment of extensive agricultural, agroforest, and alternative land-use systems on marginal or degraded lands could sequester 0.82-2.2 Pg carbon (C) per year, globally, over a 50-year time-frame. Moreover, slowing soil degradation by alternative grassland management and by impeding desertification could conserve up to 0.5-1.5 Pg C annually. A global analysis of biologic and economic data from 94 nations representing diverse climatic and edaphic conditions reveals a range of integrated land-use systems which could be used to establish and manage vegetation on marginal or degraded lands. Promising land-use systems and practices identified to conserve and temporarily store C include agroforestry systems, fuelwood and fiber plantations, bioreserves, intercropping systems, and shelterbelts/windbreaks. For example, successful establishment of low-intensity agroforestry systems can store up to 70 Mg C/ha in boreal, temperate and tropical ecoregions. The mean initial cost of soil rehabilitation and revegetation ranges from $500-3,000/ha for the 94 nations surveyed. Natural regeneration of woody vegetation or agro-afforestation establishment costs were less than $1000/ha in temperate and tropical regions. The costs of C sequestration in soil and vegetation systems range from $1-69/Mg C, which compares favorably with other options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Although agroforestry system projects were recently established to conserve and sequester C in Guatemala and Malaysia, constraints to wide-spread implementation include social conditions (demographic factors, land tenure issues, market conditions, lack of infrastructure), economic obstacles (difficulty of demonstrating benefits of alternative systems, capital requirements, lack of financial incentives) and, ecologic considerations (limited knowledge of impacts and sustainability of some systems). © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Raman scattering measurements, which probe the crystallinity of the film surface, indicate that nitrogen implantation reduces the finite crystallographic order in the pristine carbon films. The absence of molecular vibrations in the infrared absorption spectra of the films argues against a polymeric structure of the ion-implanted films. Spectroscopic ellipsometry experiments determine the change in the optical constants of the carbon film due to nitrogen implantation. Electrical de conductivity measurements are interpreted within the framework of a schematic density of states picture of graphitic Tr-electrons in an amorphous carbon system. Taken collectively, the optical and electrical measurements suggest that nitrogen implantation increases the density of localized states within the 1.5 eV bandgap of the quasi-amorphous carbon film, thereby reducing the bandgap and increasing the conductivity of the nitrogen-implanted films. © 1994, Materials Research Society.

Relatively modest inputs in health care can lead to considerable health gain. This has economic implications in a climate of reducing resources for health care internationally. However at a population level, better health may result from inputs in sectors other than health, particularly education, housing and higher employment rates.

The bicarbonate ions did not interfere with Cu2O film formation but the Cu2+ ions were stabilized by the complexing action of CO2-3anions. In phosphate solutions, copper dissolved in the range of potentials associated with the Cu(I) oxidation state and the Cu(II) compound on the surface resulted in an extensive passivation region. In both solutions, a higher ion concentration caused an increase in the anodic current, suggesting that the copper ions were stabilized by the complexing action of the electrolyte. The copper oxidation current in a bicarbonate solution was higher than that observed in a phosphate solution of the same concentration. The thickness of the Cu(II) film rather than the Cu(I) layer appears to be the important factor related to the stability of the passive layer on the copper surface. The shift in the breakdown potential toward more positive values indicates that both bicarbonate and phosphate ions inhibit localized corrosion due to the presence of chloride ions. Their protective effect depends on the concentration of each anion, although the concentration of chloride ions necessary for pitting is larger in phosphate solutions than in bicarbonate solutions. In both solutions, long-term immersion of copper under anodic polarization results in the precipitation of a protective coating. © 1994 Chapman &amp; Hall.",,"Carbonates; Complexation; Copper compounds; Electrolytes; Film growth; Ions; Oxidation; Passivation; Phosphates; Pitting; Protective coatings; Solutions; Anion concentration; Anodic current; Bicarbonate solutions; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028419498

The collision systems investigated are Bq+, Cq+ (q=2-5) and Oq+, Fq+ (q=3-6) projectiles impacting on helium and Cq+ (q=2-5) ions impacting on neon and argon targets. Laboratory electron emission angles between 10°and 60°were studied. Under the assumption that the cross sections scale with the square of an effective projectile charge, Zeff(É,θ), the scaling was investigated as a function of emitted electron velocity and angle. For distant collisions (low-energy electron emission), we find that Zeff(É,θ)>q for small q. For the highest values of q investigated, Zeff(É,θ) was found to be smaller than the net projectile charge q. The effective projectile charges may be subject to a systematic underestimation since they were determined by referencing the partially stripped ion impact data to fully stripped boron, rather than proton, impact cross sections. In the binary-encounter region, the present data confirm previously observed features-namely that the emission increases as q decreases.

Nitrogen regeneration driven by simple mass-specific excretion constants seems to overestimate the role of bacteria in the regeneration process. Quantitative assessment of the link-sink question, in which the original loop models are grounded, requires sophisticated analysis of size-based trophic structures. The effects of recycling complicate calculation of the link between bacteria or dissolved organic matter and mesozooplankton, and indirect effects show that the link might be much stronger than simple analyses have suggested. Examples drawn from a series of oceanic mixed layer plankton models are used to illustrate some of these points. Single-size class models related to traditional P-Z-N approaches are incapable of simulating bacterial biomass cycles in some locations (e.g., Bermuda) but appear to be adequate for more strongly seasonal regimes at higher latitudes. © 1994 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001472297

The experimental program included low-frequency torsional stress-strain loops and torsional resonant column tests, providing values of shear moduli for shear-strain amplitudes from 0.0004% to 0.1%. At all values of strain amplitude, the reduction of shear modnli caused by the presence of gas bubbles was greater than predicted by a theoretical elastic expression. This pattern of behavior was attributed to the formation of local yield zones around the gasbubble cavities during consolidation prior to shear testing (a phenomenon that would also occur in-situ within offshore sediments). The results of the research program suggest that reductions in shear moduli of up to 50% could be caused by relatively small volumes of gas bubbles, occupying just a few percent of the total soil volume. This would have considerable significance for the displacements of offshore foundations constructed on sediments containing undissolved gas. © ASCE.",,"Bubble formation; Shear stress; Gas-bubble cavities; Kaolin containing methane bubbles; Shear testing; Theoretical elastic expression; Methane; Gases; Kaolin; Methane Bubbles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028669196

Ohe initial higher rate of turnover of PS II in viva is accounted by the fact that (i) PS I contains only about one-third of total chlorophylls, (ii) about 90% of light harvesting a/b protein (LAC) which accounts for about 50% of the total chlorophylls, remains associated with PS II as PS II-LHC II complexes (PS IIα and (iii) the ratio of PS II/PS I is always greater than unity, in the range of 1-2 : 1 under different environmental regimes. Ohe initial preferential feeding of PS II, due to its larger antenna, is bound to result in faster rate of turn over of PS II than PS I, leading to higher rate of reduction of an intersystem carrier than the rate of its oxidation by PS I. Ohe light dependent phosphorylation of a 'mobile' and small pool (-20%) of LHC II of PS IIα (possibly located at the edge of appressed regions of the membranes) increases the repulsive forces of LHC II resulting in its migration to non-appressed region associating itself with PS 1.

Several experimental approaches have provided evidence which suggest that (i) phosphorylation of LAC II involves interaction of cyt b5-f complex with LAC II kinase and the interaction of QA with cyt b5-f complex and (ii) different kinases may be involved in phosphorylation of LHC II versus PS II polypeptides. Ohe major purpose of light dependent LAC II phosphorylation and its consequent migration close to PS I appears to balance the rate of cyclic versus non-cyclic photophosphorylation.

The analysis is cast both in a full master-equation treatment and in a Floquet treatment of an atom driven bichromatically in vacuum, the latter allowing for an interpretation of the full calculation.

The most recent computer models of future climatic changes resulting from increasing carbon dioxide emissions are discussed in relation to the possible impacts that the predicted climatic shifts may have on the distribution and abundance of the main allergenic pollen types. The probable repercussions of these changes on the patterns and incidences of seasonal allergic rhinitis are considered. This study focuses on pollen from Betula, the Poaceae, Ambrosia, Parietaria and Olea, but also examines the implications of climatic change for other aeroallergens, including those from various crops such as Brassica species (oil‐seed rape) and Helianthemum (sunflowers). In the case of natural distributions, the response of the plants to climatic changes are viewed in relation to the potential migration rates of the species. For agricultural crops, shifts in the location of productive areas involve agricultural economics both at the national and European community levels. In addition to broad regional impacts, this study examines the influence of increasing ultraviolet radiation on pollen production over various areas of Europe, and considers the effect of changing airflow trajectories on the long‐range transport of pollen with pollution from central and northern Europe into Scandinavia.

The objective of the study has been to prepare a priority action programme to pre-feasibility level to control and reduce the present pollution of the Baltic Sea from the Vistula River Basin and Baltic Coast of Poland in line with the 1990 Balde Sea Declaration. This includes a target objective of the adoption of measures by the countries in the region to reduce the 1987 emission levels by 50 percent by 1995. The municipal wastewater from about 1 3 of the population in Poland is not treated at all, and most of the existing treatment is of low efficiency. Also most of the industrial plants have high pollution discharge loads. Nitrogen runoff is the most obvious problem from the agriculture. The yearly discharge of nitrogen to the Baltic Sea is in the order of magnitude 100,000 tons. Phosphorus is also discharged in large quantities, as most of the sewage treatment plants are not constructed for chemical or biological phosphorus removal. Actions proposed for implementation to the year 2000 are described, primarily for protection of the Baltic Sea. These actions include mainly treatment plants for removal of phosphorus, nitrogen and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), but also heavy metals and persistent organic substances. All major polluting industries should also take steps in order not to exceed accepted pollution levels.

We found that the cell permeant carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide (ACTZ), increased pneumostomal opening and ventilation during normocapnia (2-3% CO2) and decreased the rate of pneumostomal response to step changes in CO2 (4.5%), but did not changed the steady-state ventilatory response to elevated CO2 (4.5%) compared to the inactive ACTZ analogue, N2-substituted 2-acetylamino-1,3,4-thiadiazole (Cl 13850). In contrast, the cell impermeant carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, quarterny ammonium sulfonilamide (QAS), had no effect on the pneumostomal response to CO2 compared to Cl 13850. Using Hansson's histochemical technique to stain for carbonic anhydrase activity, we identified a small number of neurons in the subesophageal ganglia that exhibited carbonic anhydrase activity. Some of these cells were in the region of CO2-sensitivity. In conclusion, carbonic anhydrase inhibition slows the ventilatory response to rapid changes in CO2, but does not affect the intrinsic ability of H. aspersa to respond to CO2.

Our results show that the higher than second-order contributions from the poles are of vital importance for the nuclear magnetic shieldings and of less, but not negligible, importance for the static polarizabilities. As the order of the poles is decreased the SOPPA isotropic shieldings approach the results obtained within second-order perturbation theory (MP2), especially for CO, N2, and F2. This behavior is not as pronounced for the C shielding of CH 4 and for polarizabilities. For the shieldings we obtain the best agreement with MP2 (and experiments) when the poles are calculated as Hartree-Fock energy differences using frozen ground state orbitals, and for the polarizabilities when the poles are calculated in the random phase approximation and Tamm-Dancoff approximation. © 1994 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9344226379

On geological time scales there is profound evidence of the importance of phytoplankton photosynthesis in biogeochemical cycles. It is generally assumed that present phytoplankton productivity is in a quasi steady-state (on the time scale of decades). However, in a global context, the stability of oceanic photosynthetic processes is dependent on the physical circulation of the upper ocean and is therefore strongly influenced by the atmosphere. The net flux of atmospheric radiation is critical to determining the depth of the upper mixed layer and the vertical fluxes of nutrients. These latter two parameters are keys to determining the intensity, and spatial and temporal distributions of phytoplankton blooms. Atmospheric radiation budgets are not in steady-state. Driven largely by anthropogenic activities in the 20th century, increased levels of IR- absorbing gases such as CO2, CH4 and CFC's and NOx will potentially increase atmospheric temperatures on a global scale. The atmospheric radiation budget can affect phytoplankton photosynthesis directly and indirectly. Increased temperature differences between the continents and oceans have been implicated in higher wind stresses at the ocean margins. Increased wind speeds can lead to higher nutrient fluxes. Throughout most of the central oceans, nitrate concentrations are sub-micromolar and there is strong evidence that the quantum efficiency of Photosystem II is impaired by nutrient stress. Higher nutrient fluxes would lead to both an increase in phytoplankton biomass and higher biomass-specific rates of carbon fixation. However, in the center of the ocean gyres, increased radiative heating could reduce the vertical flux of nutrients to the euphotic zone, and hence lead to a reduction in phytoplankton carbon fixation. Increased desertification in terrestrial ecosystems can lead to increased aeolean loadings of essential micronutrients, such as iron. An increased flux of aeolean micronutrients could fertilize nutrient-replete areas of the open ocean with limiting trace elements, thereby stimulating photosynthetic rates. The factors which limit phytoplankton biomass and photosynthesis are discussed and examined with regard to potential changes in the Earth climate system which can lead the oceans away from steady-state. While it is difficult to confidently deduce changes in either phytoplankton biomass or photosynthetic rates on decadal time scales, time-series analysis of ocean transparency data suggest long-term trends have occurred in the North Pacific Ocean in the 20th century. However, calculations of net carbon uptake by the oceans resulting from phytoplankton photosynthesis suggest that without a supply of nutrients external to the ocean, carbon fixation in the open ocean is not presently a significant sink for excess atmospheric CO2. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","biogeochemical cycles; oceans; photoacclimation; Photosystem II nutrient limitation; phytoplankton quantum efficiency of photosynthesis",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001297070

After reviewing possible radiation mechanisms we conclude that, given the probable conditions in the flaring region, the radio emission is gyrosynchrotron radiation and the X-ray emission is thermal bremsstrahlung. The thermal X-ray source must lie in the stellar chromosphere, but the apparent absence of plasma absorption at radio frequencies indicates that the radio source is located high in the coronal loop.

Ventilation rates were increased, at a minimum, to meet the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) standard, Ventilation for acceptable Indoor Air Quality (ASHRAE 62-1989). This paper presents the results and the preliminary evaluations which led to the team's decision to implement this technology. Factors considered include energy penalties, comfort, indoor air quality (IAQ), building shell tightness, and equipment costs. Cost benefit of heat recovery ventilation was also considered. Earlier results of the SEP team's efforts have indicated a severe ventilation problem within the schools of the United States. An integrated approach to radon mitigation in schools and other large buildings which control radon as well as improve overall IAQ should be the goal of radon remediation where practical. Two cases studies are presented where HVAC technology was implemented for controlling radon concentrations. One involved the installation of a heat recovery ventilator to depressurise a crawl space and provide ventilation to the classrooms which previously had no mechanical ventilation. The other involved the restoration of a variable air volume system in a two-storey building. The HVAC system's controls were restored and modified to provide a constant building pressure differential to control the entry of radon.

These textures have been modelled using petrogenetic grids for reactions in the CaO‐Al2,O3‐SiO2‐CO2 system, but with reduced mineral activities to account for additional components in real mineral compositions. Such fixed‐composition reduced‐activity grids are strictly valid only at the point in P‐T‐aCO2 space where an assemblage last equilibrated, and do not show the true positions of reactions away from this point because mineral compositions change with reaction progress. In this case, however, mineral compositions close to end‐member values and low extents of reaction progress mean that compositional change was limited and the grids are good approximations to true pseudosections over the entire P‐T‐aco2 range of interest. The grids show that the textures are consistent with near‐isobaric cooling from about 850 to 700d̀ C at 7 kbar, a P‐T path compatible with thermobarometric studies of other lithologies from the area. Phase relationships indicate that CO2 activities were buffered by the local mineral assemblage during peak and retrograde metamorphism, either under fluid‐absent conditions or within a non‐pervasive fluid phase. Previous studies of garnet coronas in scapolite‐wollastonite calc‐silicates have used qualitative grids based on limited experimental data to invoke garnet growth during water infiltration at high temperature, but the grids used here show that garnet coronas can form on cooling, without any need for water influx.

The early stage of this climatic transition from ∼16 to 14.8 Ma was marked by major short term variations in global climates, East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) volume, sea level, and deep ocean circulation. In the later stage from ∼14.8 to 12.9 Ma, climatic developments included major growth of the EAIS and associated Antarctic cooling, a distinct increase in the meridional temperature gradient, large fluctuations in sea level followed by a global sea level fall, and important changes in deep water circulation, including increased production of Southern Component Water. East Antarctic ice sheet growth and polar cooling also had large effects on global carbon cycling and on the terrestrial biosphere, including aridification of mid-latitude continental regions. Increased stability of the EAIS after 14.8 Ma represents a crucial step in the establishment of late Neogene global climate systems. What controlled these changes in polar climates and the East Antarctic ice sheet? Deep ocean circulation changes probably played a major role in the evolution and variation in polar climates, as they have throughout the Cenozoic. Oxygen and carbon isotopic evidence for warm, saline deep water production in the eastern Tethyan/northern Indian Ocean indicates that meridional heat transport to the Antarctic inhibited Cenozoic polar cooling and EAIS growth during the early middle Miocene from ∼16 to ∼14.8 Ma. Inferred competition between warm low-latitude sources (derived from the eastern Tethyan-northern Indian Ocean) and a cold high-latitude source (Southern Component Water) from ∼16 to 14.8 Ma may have been associated with instability in the Antarctic climate and cryosphere. Reduction of warm, saline deep water flow to the Southern Ocean at ∼14.8 Ma may have decreased meridional heat transport to the Antarctic, cooling the region and leading to increased production of Southern Component Water. These middle Miocene climatic and cryospheric changes in the Antarctic had profound effects on marine and terrestrial climates.

Therefore, most studies of predictive behaviour are based on models which, when unconstrained by data, are often worse than no model at all. Geochemistry and environmental isotope geochemistry are techniques well suited for hydrological investigations of potential sites of nuclear waste isolation and for constraining predictive models. Stable isotopes constitutive of the water molecule (2H and 18O) may give information on the origin of the water, especially 2H which is practically uninvolved in isotope exchange with rock‐forming minerals. Variations in stable isotope contents can be related to palaeohydrological and palaeoclimatic conditions whereas 3H is indicative of recent recharge. The 13C content of dissolved carbon is related to its origin(s) and the 14C activity gives a time‐scale. However, the initial carbon isotope contents can be modified by various diagenetic effects such as precipitation/dissolution of secondary calcite and oxidation of reduced carbon. The heavy isotope content of the Total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (TDIC) cannot be interpreted without a detailed knowledge of the carbon chemistry and of the mineralogy and isotope contents of secondary carbonates. Species of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), with high molecular weights (HMW) can generally be attributed to soil derived compounds. Their 14C content may be measured by AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) thus providing an estimate of the time elapsed since recharge took place. Chlorine‐36 is an interesting potential tool for dating old ground waters because of its long half‐life (301 kyr) and its hydrophilic behaviour. It can be also produced in situ in significant amount if the rocks are rich (some tens of ppm) in U and Th. In such cases, this time dependent build‐up provides a more systematic radiochronometer of CI‐ residence time in the rock than the decay of cosmic input 36CI, provided no Cl‐ is leached from the rock. The isotopic composition of aqueous sulphur compounds depends on their origin and on their diagenetic evolution. The redox reactions of SO2‐4 reduction or of S2‐ oxidation are marked by strong isotope effects especially when generated by bacteria. Sulphate reduction by organic matter is a potential source of dissolved inorganic carbon and may thus interfere with 14C age interpretations. After discussion of the possible age and origin of waters and solutes, some scenarios of evolution of local and regional palaeohydrological conditions are proposed. Examples are given with special emphasis on detailed results from the Fennoscanian shield (Stripa project), and from northern Switzerland. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

On the basis of differences in primary sequence motifs providing the cluster ligands and upon structural differences elucidated by X-ray crystallography, we now propose that the presently known, soluble diiron-oxo proteins can be grouped into two classes, I and II. Class I contains hemerythrin, myohemerythrin, and, possibly, purple acid phosphatase. Class II contains ribonucleotide reductases, bacterial hydrocarbon hydroxylases (methane monooxygenase, toluene-4- monooxygenase, and phenol hydroxylase), rubrerythrin, and stearoyl-ACP desaturases. Through the use of resonance Raman spectroscopy, we have detected symmetric (vs = 519 cm−1) and asymmetric (vas = 747 cm−1) vibrational modes in the castor stearoyl-ACP Δ9 desaturase, which are typical of oxo-bridged diiron clusters. These frequencies shift by -18 and -34 cm−1, respectively, in H2 18O, proving that the bridging ligand is readily exchangeable with solvent (t1/2 = 7 min). Calculation of an ~ 123° Fe-O-Fe angle from the position of vs and vas and from the 18O-dependent shift in these frequencies suggests that the diiron-oxo cluster in the desaturase is triply bridged in the diferric state. In the diferrous state, the two iron sites of the cluster are structurally inequivalent, as shown by differential temperature dependence of the Mössbauer quadrupole splittings. For the class II diiron-oxo proteins, primary sequence alignments reveal conserved amino acid residues which act as iron cluster ligands, participate in a hydrogen-bonding network, and are potentially involved in O2 binding and activation. Based on this conservation, a structural model for the stearoyl-ACP Δ9 desaturase active site is proposed that has strong similarity to both ribonucleotide reductase and methane monooxygenase. However, after single turnover of the diferrous state with 18O2, 18O is not detected in the oxo bridge of the castor desaturase. This is in contrast to the outcome observed for ribonucleotide reductase, suggesting the desaturase and ribonucleotide reductase differ in certain aspects of their respective O2-activation reactions. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

The oxidation of the depositing species was determined from the deposition rate dependence on P0land the P0ldependence of the positive secondary ion emission from the sputtering targets. Films deposited at high po2(Po2greater than the critical partial pressure for oxidation of the Pb target surface) were fully oxidized, and they formed the pyrochlore phase during annealing. The low P0lconditions (Po2 less than or equal to the critical partial pressure for oxidation of the Pb target surface) caused sputtering of incompletely oxidized Pb species, and the resulting oxygen deficient films produced phase-pure perovskite. The formation of the pyrochlore phase at high pq 2and the perovskite phase at low pq2is independent of Pb content within the film; the phase formation is dependent on the oxidation state of the Pb, which is sensitive to both the Po2 and the sputtering rate of the Pb. A perovskite/pyrochlore phase formation model (PPFM) that incorporates annealing time, temperature, and heating rate, and thin film oxygen deficiency was developed to explain the formation of the perovskite and pyrochlore phase during postdeposition annealing of PLT thin films. © 1994, Materials Research Society.

One tool that has been developed to aid regulators in both deciding an appropriate course of action and to demonstrate the desired reductions in mobile emissions is EPA's Mobile 5a emission estimation model. In our study, Mobile 5a has been used to examine the effects of regulatory strategies, as applied to the Northeast United States, on vehicle emissions under worst-case ozone-forming conditions. We examined the effects of the following mandatory and discretionary measures: inspection and maintenance (I/M), enhanced I/M, anti-tampering, reformulated gasolines (RFG I &amp; 11), Federal Tier I &amp; II vehicle standards, California's program of emission standards (LEV, ULEV, ZEV), Stage II refueling, and on-board vapor recovery (VRS). The rank order of effectiveness, for pollutant reduction, of these measures depends on the pollutant and the time period chosen. Two time periods are of interest, near-term (1993-2000) and far-term (2000-2010). In terms of non-methane organic gas (NMOG) emission reductions in the near-term, RFG I is the most effective measure followed by enhanced I/M and then regular I/M with less effectiveness attributable to the remaining programs. In the long-term the benefits from RFG I &amp; II on NMOG emissions are still present; however, they are overshadowed by those from I/M programs and Tier I vehicles. The NO x situation is different due to the smaller benefit of reformulated gasolines on NOx emissions. In the short-term the largest benefits come from I/M programs with those from Tier I vehicles emerging by the year 2000. In the long-term regular I/M and Tier I vehicles are the most significant measures with fewer benefits from enhanced I/M. The results we obtain indicate that the adoption of the California vehicles in the Northeast instead of Tier I vehicles, with the other requirements of the 1990 CAAA, would not provide any emissions benefits before the year 2005. This is due, primarily to the reduced benefits of I/M assumed in Mobile 5a for California cars. In accordance with this result, the sensitivity of the aggregate fleet emissions to the possible phase-in date of the California cars is small. A separate finding is that the in-use aggregate-fleet emissions of light-duty trucks are not attenuated by fleet rollover as substantially as those of the light-duty passenger cars. Additionally, the relative growth rate in vehicle miles traveled for light-duty trucks is much higher. Thus, the relative contribution of light-duty trucks to vehicle emissions is predicted to increase. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Aggregates; Air quality; Air quality standards; Automobiles; Compliance control; Emission control; Exhaust gases; Fleet operations; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Regulatory compliance; Trucks; Clean air act amendments; Degree of reduction; Emission estimation model; Inspection and maintenance; National ambient air quality standards; Relative contribution; Relative growth rate; Vehicle-miles traveled; Reformulated gasoline",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072441174

Contessa) was grown with a nitrogen supply that was just sufficient to support maximal biomass production. The third leaves from 14-to 21-d-old plants were harvested and net photosynthesis allowed to attain steady-state rates at an irradiance of either 250 or 700 μmol·m-2·s-1. Nitrogen in the form of either KNO3, KNO2 or NH4Cl was then supplied to the leaves through the transpiration stream. In all cases the addition of the nitrogen source resulted in an approximate doubling of the total amino-acid content of the leaves within 1 h. The glutamine pool increased to ten times the level found in control leaves in the light in the absence of added nitrogen. Glutamine accounted for about 21-24% of the total amino-acid content in leaves fed with 40 mM NH4Cl. Nitrate caused a rapid, but transient inhibition of the rate of net CO2 assimilation, accompanied by an increase in the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and a decrease in the maximum extractable activity of sucrose-phosphate synthase. This demonstrates that the activities of phospho-enolpyruvate carboxylase and sucrose-phosphate synthase are modulated by NO3-in the C4 plant maize, in a similar manner to that observed in C3 plants. Nitrite or ammonium feeding resulted in decreased rates of CO2 assimilation for as long as the nitrogen source was supplied. In all cases the degree of inhibition was greatest at high irradiance and least at low irradiance, even though the total amino-acid contents of the leaves were comparable at the time when maximum inhibition of CO2 assimilation occurred. Measurements of chlorophyll-a fluorescence showed that the quantum efficiency of PSII decreased and non-radiative dissipation of excitation energy increased as CO2 assimilation was inhibited by nitrate or nitrite. These metabolites had no direct effect on thylakoid PSII-based electron transport. Ammonium ions weakly inhibited O2 evolution at high concentrations. The addition of nitrogen (KNO3-, KNO2 or NH4Cl) caused a significant decrease in the phosphorylation state of the light-harvesting chlorophyll-a/b-binding protein of the thylakoid membranes. We conclude that the response of photosynthetic carbon assimilation and electron transport in maize is essentially similar whether nitrogen is supplied in the form of nitrate, nitrite or ammonium, with the noteworthy exception that the nitrogen-induced inhibition of photosynthesis is transient when leaves are supplied with NO3-but sustained when NO2-or NH4+is provided. We suggest that the observed modulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and sucrose-phosphate synthase is mediated by the increase in the endogenous level of glutamine. Furthermore, the transient nature of the inhibition of CO2 assimilation in the case of NO3-, but not NO2-or NH4+, may be due to regulation of nitrate reductase. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Chlorophyll-a/b-binding protein complex; Nitrogen assimilation; Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; Photosynthesis; Sucrose phosphate synthase; Zea (photosynthesis)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028118156

Because it occurs in more one quarter of all cases, it should be anticipated during intubation and the initial phase of ventilator management, especially in high-risk patients such as those with hypercarbic COPD. The cause of LTH is probably multifactorial, and potential mechanisms include preexisting volume depletion, right ventricular compromise, auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and catecholamine reduction during CO2 washout. The frequency of LTH after intubation has implications for intubation procedures, ABG monitoring, ventilator adjustment, and fluid and vasopressor resuscitation. © 1994.","Critical care-mechanical ventilation; emergency department; endotracheal intubation-complications; intensive care unit","adult; arterial gas; article; artificial ventilation; blood pressure monitoring; endotracheal intubation; female; fluid therapy; heart arrest; human; hypotension; incidence; lung insufficiency; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; priority journal; treatment planning; Anoxemia; Blood Gas Analysis; Blood Pressure; Carbon Dioxide; Emergencies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Fluid Therapy; Human; Hypercapnia; Hypotension; Incidence; Intubation, Intratracheal; Lung Diseases, Obstructive; Male; Middle Age; Monitoring, Physiologic; Prospective Studies; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Insufficiency; Resuscitation; Risk Factors; Vasoconstrictor Agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028291502

We focus on the chemical and electronic structure of the organoaluminum complexes. Special emphasis is put on a comparison between results at the local spin density approximation and ab initio Hartree-Fock levels. In unmetallized polyenes, the density functional method provides a very good description of the carbon-carbon bond lengths of conjugated systems; in the case of hexatriene, it reproduces the bond dimerization in very good agreement with experimental measurements. Upon metallization, a strong covalent interaction between aluminum and carbon is found. The Al-C bond formation induces an interruption of the bond alternation pattern and reduces the π-conjugation in the oligomer, in qualitative agreement with photoelectron spectroscopy data and previous theoretical results at the Hartree-Fock level. Notably, the π-electron levels in the organoaluminum complexes maintain delocalization. In contrast to Hartree-Fock results where an aluminum atom binds to a single carbon, the interactions calculated with the local spin density approximation lead to (i) formation of multicenter aluminum-carbon bonding; (ii) near planarity of the polyene molecule; and (iii) a lower degree of charge transfer from the metal atom to the polymer. © 1994 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004365162

In order to identify hydrocarbons derived from phytoplankton, the isotopic compositions expected for biomass of autotrophic organisms living in surface waters of both localities were calculated based on the concentrations of CO2(aq) and the isotopic compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon. These calculated values are compared to measured δ values for particulate organic carbon and for individual hydrocarbon compounds. Specifically, we find that lycopane is probably derived from phytoplankton and that diploptene is derived from the lipids of chemoautotrophs living above the oxic/anoxic boundary. Three acyclic isoprenoids that have been considered markers for methanogens, pentamethyleicosane and two hydrogenated squalenes, have different δ values and apparently do not derive from a common source. Based on the concentration profiles and isotopic compositions, the C31 and C33 n-alkanes and n-alkenes have a similar source, and both may have a planktonic origin. If so, previously assigned terrestrial origins of organic matter in some Black Sea sediments may be erroneous. © 1994.","anoxic sediments; Black Sea; Cariaco Trench; diploptene; dissolved inorganic carbon; lycopane; methanogens; particulate organic carbon; pentamethyleicosane; squalene","Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Hydrocarbons; Isotopes; Marine biology; Methanogens; Particles (particulate matter); Autotrophic organisms; Carbon isotopic composition; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Particulate organic carbon; Phytoplankton; Predictive isotopic biogeochemistry; Natural water geochemistry; anoxic basins; biogeochemistry; hydrocarbons; isotopic compositions; Black Sea; Caribbean Sea, Cariaco Trench; carbon; carbon dioxide; hydrocarbon; article; bacterium; biology; biomass; chemistry; Europe; mass fragmentography; metabolism; microbiology; NASA Discipline Exobiology; Non-NASA Center; phytoplankton; sea; sediment; NASA Discipline Exobiology; Non-NASA Center; Bacteria; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Environmental Microbiology; Europe; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Geologic Sediments; Hydrocarbons; Marine Biology; Oceans and Seas; Phytoplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028668412

We developed a 5° × 5° longitude-latitude resolution model of the biosphere in which the global distributions of the major biospheric variables, i.e. the vegetation types and the main carbon pools and fluxes, are determined from climatic variables. We defined nine major broad vegetation types: perennial ice, desert and semi-desert, tundra, coniferous forest, temperate deciduous forest, grassland and shrubland, savannah, seasonal tropical forest and evergreen tropical forest. Their geographical repartition is parameterized using correlations between observed vegetation type, precipitation and biotemperature distributions. The model computes as a function of climate and vegetation type, the variables related to the continental biospheric carbon cycle, i.e. the carbon pools such as the phytomass, the litter and the soil organic carbon; and carbon fluxes such as net primary production, litter production and heterotrophic respiration. The modeled present-day biosphere is in good agreement with observation. The model is used to investigate the response of the terrestrial biosphere to climatic changes as predicted by different General Circulation Models (GCM). In particular, the impact on the biosphere of climatic conditions corresponding to the last glacial climate (LGM), 18 000 years ago, is investigated. Comparison with results from present-day climate simulations shows the high sensitivity of the geographical distribution of vegetation types and carbon content as well as biospheric trace gases emissions to climatic changes. The general trend for LGM compared to the present is an increase in low density vegetation types (tundra, desert, grassland) to the detriment of forested areas, in tropical as well as in other regions. Consequently, the biospheric activity (carbon fluxes and trace gases emissions) was reduced. © 1993.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide fixation; climate; conference paper; environmental temperature; forest; greenhouse effect; model; precipitation; soil; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028366316

Because there were no available exhaust emission test data on which emission reduction goals could be based, Caltrans funded a test program to acquire gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions data, along with smoke opacity data, from two state-of-the-art intercity passenger locomotives. The two passenger locomotives (an EMD F59PH and a GE DASH8-32BWH) were tested at the Association of American Railroads Chicago Technical Center. The EMD locomotive was eqiupped with a separate Detroit Diesel, Corporation (DDC) 8V-149 diesel engine used to provide 480 V AC power for the trailing passenger cars. This DDC engine was also emission tested. These data were used to quantify baseline exhaust emission levels as a challenge to locomotive manufacturers to offer new locomotives with reduced emissions. Data from the two locomotive engines were recorded at standard fuel injection timing and with the fuel injection timing retarded 4 deg in an effort to reduce NOx emissions. Results of this emissions testing were incorporated into the Caltrans locomotive procurement process by including emission performance requirements in the Caltrans intercity passenger locomotive specification, and therefore in the procurement decision. This paper contains steady-state exhaust emission test results for hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) from the two locomotives.

During the summer the most populated regions of Canada frequently record ozone concentrations that exceed the one-hour average maximum acceptable air quality objective of 82 parts per billion (ppb). In 1988 the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment agreed to develop a federal/provincial management plan to control nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound emissions to reduce ozone concentrations in all affected regions of the country. In addition to the proposed interim control measures, the plan recommended that studies be undertaken to acquire the information necessary to develop sound control strategies. This report represents one of those studies and provides a summary of ground-level ozone measurements for eastern Canada for the 1980 to 1991 period with an emphasis on seasonal variations, trends, and occurrences of high concentrations. Southwestern Ontario experiences the highest maximum hourly ozone concentrations and the greatest frequency of hours greater than the 82 ppb acceptable objective. Urban sites have the highest frequencies of ozone concentration measurements in the < 10 ppb range, while rural and remote sites show peaks in frequency distribution in the 20 to 30 ppb range. Trend analysis of summertime (May to September) average daily maximum ozone concentration showed no consistent pattern for eastern Canadian sites during 1980 to 1991. Sites in Montreal showed statistically insignificant downward trends while sites in Toronto showed small but statistically significant upward trends. These ozone-increasing trends are associated with reductions in nitric oxide concentrations. At all sites there was large year-to-year variability in peak ozone levels and in the frequency of hours with ozone concentrations above the maximum acceptable objective.",,"nitric oxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; air sampling; article; Canada; priority journal; seasonal variation; summer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028025407

Electrophilic additions of HBF4·OEt2 and MeOSO2CF3 to the neutral σ-alkynyl complexes yield the cationic vinylidene complexes [Ru- (═C═CR2R1)(η5-C9H7)L2]+ (R2 = H, Me), which have been isolated as tetrafluoroborate or triflate salts in good yields.

In the structure of the cationic complex the dimethylvinylidene ligand is almost linearly bound to the Ru atom (Ru─C(1)─C(2) = 173.7(6)°) with an Ru─C(1) distance of 1.839(7) Å and the ruthenium—vinylidene chain Ru═C═C lying out of the mirror molecular plane (conformational angle (CA) = 22.2(4)°). The coordination around the Ru atom is completed by two P atoms from the triphenylphosphine ligand and a η5-bonded indenyl ligand with the benzo ring orientated trans to the vinylidene group. The structure shows distortions of the five-carbon ring from planarity with hinge angle (HA) and fold angle (FA) values of 8.1(6) and 13.1(6)°, respectively, and a pronounced slip-fold value of 0.197(7) Å. Extended Hückel molecular orbital calculations were used to rationalize the preferred “trans” orientation of the indenyl ligand with respect to the vinylidene group. 1H, 31P{1H), and 13C{1H} NMR spectra are discussed. 13C{1H} NMR data are used for the calculation of the indenyl distortion parameters, showing that the distortion of the η5-indenyl coordination in the solid state is maintained in solution. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

A detailed facies analyses of 25 cores from the Upper Freeport Limestone in western Pennsylvania (Armstrong and Indiana Counties) identified four facies associations containing thirteen separate facies: rudstone-limestone (Association A), rudstone-laminated limestone (Association B), laminated limestone (Association C), and coal - siliciclastics (Association D). We interpreted them, respectively, as shallow, high energy lacustrine margin (A); littoral to sublittoral lacustrine (B); offshore lake (C); and vegetated swamp and marsh (D). The depositional environment is envisaged as an anastomosed channel system surrounded by extensive wetlands containing adjacent densely vegetated swamp and marsh areas and freshwater, carbonate-producing lakes. Lakes developed in the topographic lows of the alluvial plain, protected and filtered from siliciclastic deposition by vegetated swamps. These lakes were small in size (several square km), shallow, and stratified, as indicated by the abundance of laminated facies. They were hydrologically open, and interconnected by surface and ground waters. Carbonate production in this lacustrine system was not triggered by evaporative concentration but by biogenic algal production. Carbonates were continually being recycled, both physicochemically and biologically, within the depositional system. Various early diagenetic processes, including brecciation, pedogenesis and recrystallization, masked original evidence for transport mode. The Upper Freeport Limestone contains numerous features of palustrine carbonates, and provides a case study for one end-member of freshwater carbonate models, characterized by a very short period of subaerial exposure. Small-scale climatic changes or autocyclic processes such as small topographic differences, changes in local drainage patterns, and fluvial dynamics may have controlled Upper Freeport lake level changes. Facies analysis does not support a climate forcing as a control for cyclothem development of non-marine sequences during the Pennsylvanian. Tectonic and autocyclic processes better explain the evolution of these wetland (lacustrine/alluvial) systems with its associated coal formation. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","carbonate; cyclothem; lacustrine; Pennsylvania; Upper Freeport; wetland","carbonate; coal; cyclothem; lacustrine deposit; Pennsylvanian; Upper Freeport Formation; USA, Appalachia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028602202

Simultaneously, membrane parameters such as modulated chlorophyll fluorescence, oxidation of P700 in the reaction centre of photosystem I, and apparent changes in absorbance at 535 nm were recorded. After light-regulated enzymes were activated at a high irradiance, illumination was changed. About 3 min later (to maintain the previous activation state of enzymes), leaves were shock-frozen and freeze-dried. Chloroplasts were isolated nonaqueously and analysed for ATP, ADP, inorganic phosphate, NADPH and NADP. Observations made under the chosen conditions differed in some important aspects from those commonly observed when leaves are illuminated in air. (i) Not only assimilation, but also the phosphorylation potential [ATP]/([ADP]·[Pi]) increased hyperbolically with irradiance towards saturation. In contrast, the ratio of NADPH to NADP did not change much as irradiances increased from low to high photon flux densities. When ATP, the phosphorylation potential and the assimilatory force, FA (the product of phosphorylation potential and NADPH/NADP ratio), were plotted against assimilation, ATP increased relatively less than assimilation, whereas the phosphorylation potential increased somewhat more steeply than assimilation did. A linear relationship existed between assimilation and FA at lower irradiances. The assimilatory force FA increased more than assimilation did when irradiances were very high. Differences from previous observations, where FA was under some conditions higher at low than at high rates of carbon assimilation, are explained by differences in flux resistances caused not only by stomatal diffusion resistance but also by differences in the activity of light-regulated enzymes, (ii) The relationship between P700 oxidation and a fast absorption change with a maximum close to 520 nm on one hand and carbon assimilation on the other hand was largely linear under the specific conditions of the experiments. A similar linear relationship existed also between the quantum efficiency of electron flow through photosystem II and the quantum efficiency of photosystem I electron transport. (iii) Whereas the increase in non-photochemical fluorescence quenching, qN, was similar to the increase in assimilation, the relationship between light scattering and assimilation was distinctly sigmoidal. Light scattering appeared to be a better indicator of control of photosystem II activity under excessive irradiation than qN. (iv) The results are discussed in relation to the relative significance of chloroplast levels of ATP and NADPH and of the assimilatory force FA in driving carbon assimilation. From the observations, the proton/electron (H+/e-) ratio of linear electron transport is suggested to be 3 and the H+/ATP ratio to be 4 in leaves. An H+/e- ratio of 3 implies the existence of an obligatory Q-cycle in leaves. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Assimilatory force; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Light scattering; P700 oxidation; Photosynthesis (phosphorylation) potential; Spinacia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027974524

In E. hirsutum leaves at low temperatures (below 15 °C), leaf net CO2 assimilation, A, was stimulated by normal O2 compared with air containing 2% O2, while at high temperatures the inhibition of A by normal O2 via stimulation of the oxygenase function of RubisCo masked the stimulatory effect of O2 on A. As a consequence of stimulation of A, the non-cyclic electron flow rate always remained higher in normal air than in air with 2% O2. In P. vulgaris, switching to non-photorespiratory conditions by increasing CO2 concentration stimulated A but did not change electron transport rates, indicating that only the partitioning of electrons between CO2 and O2 was changed. Two methods used to estimate the total photosynthetic electron transport rate gave similar results. The validity of the technique used was also tested by estimation of the CO2/O2 specificity factor of RubisCo, S. In both species, the estimated values of S agreed with that of the literature, obtained using spinach enzyme in vitro within a wide range of temperature (18 to 32 °C). However, in E. hirsutum S was considerably higher at low temperatures (below 18 °C). Overall, our results suggest that in both species, at temperatures above 18 °C, carboxylation and photorespiration are the main processes consuming photosynthetic electrons, the processes of O2 reduction other than photorespiration being negligible. © 1994, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

The work focused on the development of metal-cored wires with varying carbon and molybdenum contents for submerged-arc (SA) welding. The series of SA welds produced with the metal-cored wires, in combination with a highly basic flux, provided better toughness than achieved using the reference electrode MIL 120S1.Optimum Charpy notch toughness was achieved with the intermediate carbon and molybdenum contents. In general, the results were attributed to the influence of weld metal chemistry on the final weld microstructure, specifically the formation of a relatively fine bainitic structure with some lath martensite and limited grain boundary ferrite in both the as-deposited and reheated weld metal regions. For increasing weld metal carbon (0.040- 0.090%) and molybdenum (0.45-0.700/0) there was an increase in yield strength, hardness and tensile strength. With increasing carbon there was refinement of the microstructure, increased evidence of lath martensite, reduced (to almost no) grain boundary ferrite, and greater carbide precipitation. Changes in microstructure were much less pronounced with variation in molybdenum. In addition, increasing carbon was found to reduce the upper shelf energy, attributed to the high weld metal yield strength and increase in carbide precipitation (enhanced microvoid coalescence). © 1993 Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy Pergamon Press Ltd.",,"Carbides; Carbon; Chemistry; Evaluation; Ferrites; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Molybdenum; Precipitation (chemical); Steel; Submerged arc welding; Welds; Basic flux; Fine bainitic structure; Metal cored electrodes; Metal cored wire; Optimum charpy notch toughness; Weld metal toughness properties; Yield strength; Welding electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028125474

Thermolysis of 3 in benzene at 60 °C occurs with loss of CO from the rhenium center and provides a (μ2-η3-CO2-bridged complex, 4a. Compound 4a has been characterized by X-ray crystallography (space group P21/n, a = 10.229(6) Å, 6 = 13.737(9) Å, c = 25.25(2) Å, β= 99.20(7)°, Z = 4, ϱcalc = 1.69 g cm-3, and R = 0.038). The structure shows that the rhenium atom has facial geometry and that the phosphorus ligands on iron and rhenium are anti; additionally, the plane of the CO2 ligand bisects the angle defined by the phosphorus, iron, and carbonyl carbon atoms. Exhaustive thermolysis of 3, in solution or in the solid state, leads to a different μ2-η3-CO2-bridged complex, 5b, in which the PPh3 and P(OEt)3 ligands have exchanged metal centers; 5b retains facial geometry at rhenium. Attempted thermolysis of 4a in the solid state under similar conditions resulted in no reaction. Studies of the thermolysis reactions of 3, in solution, under milder conditions revealed the presence of intermediate compounds, 4b and 5a, which isomerized to 5b as the final product. Compounds 4b and 5a also have facial geometry at rhenium. Partial thermolysis of 4a in solution, in the presence of CO, led to mixtures containing 4b, 5a, and 5b. Reaction of 4a with P(OEt)3 led to a new μ2-η2-CO2-bridged complex, 6; reaction of 4a with CO at room temperature afforded partial conversion to 3. Thermolysis pathways are proposed in which O–Re bond breaking in the µ2-η3 complexes is followed by ligand capture (CO or P(OEt)3), facial to facial rearrangement, or phosphorus ligand exchange between the two metal centers. The thermolysis reactions clearly demonstrate the robust nature of the CO2 bridging ligands in this series of compounds. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

To develop a method capable of quantifying the oxidative modification of proteins in pulmonary fluid obtained during routine suctioning of neonates receiving ventilation, thus providing an integrated assessment of antioxidant defenses. Design. Consecutive sample of neonates receiving ventilation. Setting. Neonatal intensive care unit. Patients. Twenty-six neonates receiving ventilation with a gestational age of 24 to 42 weeks, from whom 246 samples were collected and analyzed. Measurements and results. The carbonyl content in the lavage samples was measured by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine followed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Oxidation of proteins caused introduction of carbonyl groups into the side chains of the protein, providing a convenient and relatively specific marker of oxidative damage. On the first day of life, the initial protein-bound carbonyl for each neonate was usually low and consequently was not significantly related to birth weight, gestational age, or initial ventilatory requirements. Examination of the changes in pulmonary protein carbonyl in the first days of life revealed correlations of interest. In the first day of life, four neonates whose average inspired oxygen were <40% showed no increase in carbonyl content, whereas four neonates whose inspired oxygen was >40% showed an average increase in carbonyl of 51% (P < .001). Also, the need for ventilation >3 days was correlated with elevated carbonyl in those first 3 days. The carbonyl content averaged over the first 3 days was 0.13 ± 0.02 mol carbonyl/mol protein for the eight neonates receiving ventilation <72 hours, whereas the nine needing longer ventilation had a carbonyl content of 0.28 ± 0.03 mol carbonyl/mol protein (P < .05). Seven neonates were treated with dexamethasone because of ventilator dependence at 14 days of age. In these neonates, treatment was associated with a 50% reduction in carbonyl content within 48 hours (P < .02). Conclusions. Oxidative damage to pulmonary proteins can be quantitated in samples obtained during routine suctioning of neonates receiving ventilation. The amount of oxidatively modified protein may provide a quantitative assessment of oxygen toxicity and of pulmonary antioxidant defenses.","carbonyl assay; oxidative stress; oxygen toxicity; protein oxidation; ventilation of the neonate","carbonyl derivative; dexamethasone; oxygen; article; artificial ventilation; clinical article; human; human cell; human tissue; infant; newborn; oxidation; oxygen consumption; oxygen therapy; priority journal; protein defect; protein localization; protein modification; quantitative diagnosis; suction drainage; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Chronic Disease; Dexamethasone; Female; Human; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; Ketones; Lung; Lung Diseases; Male; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Phenylhydrazines; Proteins; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028347834

The electronically excited products HCl+ (A2∑+) were detected by means of the A 2∑+ →AT 2II1 optical emission. In some cases the spectra showed, at low collision energies, an enhanced excitation of specific vibrational HCl+ (A,υ′) levels: for C+, υ′ = 1; for O+, υ′ = 3 as well as υ′ = 1; and for F+, υ′ = 6. These levels are populated in near-resonant, slightly exothermic processes. Their rotational temperature was on the order of 600-700 K. For the other vibrational levels the excitation is off-resonance, mostly endothermic, and here the rotational temperature was 1000-4000 K. Corresponding data are also given for DCl. The selectivity for certain vibrational states is explained by crossings between the vibronic entrance and exit state energy surfaces, calculated from classical electrostatic multipole potentials. The cross sections for the near-resonant reactions decrease monotonically with increasing collision energy, while for the endothermic channels they rise steeply from threshold to a plateau. With argon ions the excitation function exhibits an unusual shape. Here the charge-transfer cross sections for all vibrational levels go through a maximum just above threshold, which is followed by a distinct minimum at about 10 eVc.m..

Based on the wealth of results from the program, the stresses directly or indirectly altered flows and transformations that control a plant's carbon, nutrient, and water balances; in turn, these stress-induced effects altered material uptake, biomass production, partitioning of dry matter at the whole-plant level, and the plant's ability to compete for limited resources in the environment.

In this work, a medium-duty engine was used to determine the potential benefits of using reformulated Diesel fuel with controlled composition. This particular engine technology is used approximately in more than 60% of the corresponding transport fleet. The fuel properties that received special attention were sulfur content (390-8670 ppm), aromatic content (9.8-32.6 wt %), cetane number (40-51.6) and distillation temperature for 90 % volume recovered T90 (307-350°C). Testing was conducted on the engine installed on a test bench and operated on a 4-mode cycle with two speeds and medium to high load. Data was taken on each mode and statistical procedures for averaging, weighting and analyzing, were applied to study engine operation. Combustion performance was observed based on a heat release analysis, comparing burning rates and ignition delay. Exhaust emissions of HC, CO, NOx and specific fuel consumption were determined. Particulates were measured using a mini-dilution tunnel technique using two separate filters for each measuring condition. Chemical analysis and detailed fuel characterization is used to explain the emissions results and the effects of fuel composition on emissions. The steady state testing allowed discrimination between fuel formulations. The absolute emissions and calculated reductions, were weighted using assumed service factors, indicating the importance of properly determining representative engine operating conditions for fuel comparisons. Hydrocarbons and CO were dependent on aromatic content with reductions as high as 11 % and 12 % respectively. NOx is linearly dependent on aromatic content in the conditions studied with reductions as high as 8 %. Specific fuel consumption can be reduced as much as 2.2 % due to increased combustion efficiency. The combined effects of aromatics, sulfur content and T90 on particulate emission rates was very dependent on the operating condition, these were similar for all fuels for higher fueling rates, where in-cylinder conditions favor soot oxidation. © 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Aromatic hydrocarbons; Aromatization; Chemical analysis; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Distillation; Ignition; Load testing; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Sulfur; Urban transportation; Combustion efficiencies; Combustion performance; Distillation temperature; Engine operating conditions; Fuel characterization; Heat release analysis; Measuring conditions; Specific fuel consumption; Fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072409844

In the case of the TMGa-AsH3-H· system, the residual carbon concentrations, measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry, in epitaxial layers grown at 490°C rapidly decreased along with an increase in the H2 flow rate in a low-flow region, and saturated at around 1 × 1018 cm-3 in a higher flow region.

Thermometry measurements of the outer wall of single-cell cavities reveal the field emission from localized sites and also the reduction in field emission by processing. Subsequent scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination of the RF surface at the emission/processed sites reveals 5-10 μm sized molten craters, micron sized molten particles of foreign elements, and sub-mm sized spots shaped like starbursts.

The present worldwide energy consumption exceeds already the level of 6000 Gigawatt. It is expected to further increase sharply from the rising demand of energy in the developing countries. This implies enhanced depletion of fossil fuel reserves. leading to further aggravation of the environmental pollution exerting adverse effects on the well being of man kind. Adding the dangers arising from the accumulation of plutonium fission products from nuclear reactors, the quality of life on earth is threatened unless renewable energy resources can be developed in the near future. Photovoltaics is expected to make important contributions to identify environmentally friendly solutions of the energy problem. One attractive strategy discussed in this lecture is the development of systems that mimic natural photosynthesis in the conversion solar energy for the fixation of carbon dioxide. The task to be accomplished by these systems is to harvest sun light to produce electricity or drive an uphill chemical reaction, such as the cleavage of water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can be subsequently employed to reduce carbon dioxide to produce fuels and chemical feed stocks. Learning from the concepts used by green plants we have developed a molecular photovoltaic device whose overall efficiency for solar energy conversion to electricity has already attained 10%.. The system is based on the sensitization of nanocrystalline films by transition metal charge transfer sensitizers. In analogy to photosynthesis, the new chemical solar cell achieves the separation of light absorption and charge carrier transport. Extraordinary yields for the conversion of incident photons into electric current are obtained, exceeding 90% for transition metal complexes within the wavelength range of their absorption band. Conventional photovoltaic cells for solar energy conversion into electricity are solid state devices do not economically compete for base load utility electricity production. The low cost and ease of production of the new nanocrystalline cell should be benefit large scale applications in particular in underdeveloped or developing countries. These regions of the earth benefit from generous sun shine rendering the availability of a cheap solar cell technology important in view of improving the quality of life and preserving natural resources. Quite aside from its intrinsic merits as a photovoltaic device, the nanocrystalline films development opens up a whole number of additional avenues for energy storage ranging from intercalation batteries to the formation of chemical fuels. These nanocrystalline systems will undoubtedly promote the acceptance of renewable energy technologies, not least by setting new standards of convenience and economy. © 1994.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Crystalline materials; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Photosynthesis; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Carbon dioxide fixation; Nanocrystalline solar cells; Sensitization; Transition metal charge transfer sensitizers; Solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028482423

Careful analysis of both lamp and sky spectra show the presence of self-absorption. The nature of the absorption is different for lamp and sky profiles, in the former case absorption occurs after emission, and in the latter absorption occurs in the incident radiation prior to emission. There is a further complication in the latter case, namely, the Doppler shift of the absorption is determined by the wind component in the direction of the Sun while the Doppler shift of the emission is determined by the wind component in the direction of viewing.

The heterocyclic peripheries of these targets possess heteroatom, hydrogen atom, and in-plane lone-pair electron loci specifically selected to match closely those of the pyrimidine ring portions of the naturally-occurring purines adenine, hypoxanthine, and guanine. According to 'H and 11B NMR spectral analyses, 2-4 are stable to facile hydrolysis, but not to facile hydration, which occurs in a 1,4-fashion to give zwitterionic adducts. In addition, these benzo-fused boron heterocycles form bis-methanol adducts simply upon warming in methanol solution. A single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the bis-methanol adduct (14) derived from 3 confirmed it to be a zwitterion comprised of tetrahedral borate anion and formamidinium cation molecular fragments. From NMR-based solution structure determinations made of 2-4 and a series of substituted derivatives, the facile 1,4-hydration property appears to be endemic to the 2,4,1 -oxaza- and diazaborine classes of boron heterocycles and is projected to imbue certain future imidazo[5,4-e] -fused members with the requisite aqueous solution structural features for ""transition-state"" analog inhibition of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4).

Preparation methods used include ion exchange to give excess levels of copper, solid state exchange, physical mixing of components, and impregnation. The combination of electron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy is shown to be very powerful and has allowed identification of six different copper species, differing in their environment, degree of aggregation, or location. Both the Auger parameter and XANES structure show particular sensitivity. The external surfaces of the as-prepared zeolites are highly enriched in copper oxide species, which however become well dispersed on pretreatment. In the exchanged zeolites X-ray absorption (EXAFS and XANES), ESR, and the observation of high XPS binding energies and unexpectedly low Auger kinetic energies show that copper becomes dispersed in the zeolite channels, in the form of both isolated, 5-fold coordinate ions and small clusters containing extralattice oxygen. The catalysts show varying activity for the reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen, which correlated with the dispersion of the copper within the zeolite. In the active catalysts both electron and X-ray spectroscopic measurements indicate that there is ready conversion between Cu(I) and Cu(II), and possibly between clusters and ions, depending on the atmosphere present. The Cu(II) state predominates under conditions relevant to lean-burn exhaust gas purification. Reduction in hydrogen results in metallic particles whose size and location depends on the reduction temperature. At 493 K, EXAFS indicates that small metallic clusters are formed within the zeolite channels, which nevertheless show electron spectroscopy relaxation parameters similar to Cu(I) species. On increasing the reduction temperature to 513 K, large metal particles are formed at the external surface of the zeolite. These are inactive in the lean NOx reaction but are partially reactivated under lean-burn conditions. © 1994 American Chemical Society.",,"Copper compounds; Crystal structure; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Reduction; Zeolites; Clusters; Selective reduction; Zeolite Cu-ZSM-5; Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028532163

The number of premises covered by smoke control orders emerges as the only quantifiable variable that reflects the impact of the Act. A number of alternative hypotheses are examined: first, that declining emissions have been the result of a process of social change; second, that declining emissions are a function of structural change away from the heavy industrial sector; and, third, that improvements in air quality are the product of technological improvements and rising energy efficiency. The results presented suggest that coal consumption, the changing paterns of industrial production and local authorities smoke control zoning are the most important determinants in the reduction of smoke emissions in the UK since the early 1960s. The effectiveness of the Act is borne out but the results suggest that its impact was through industrial rather than domestic premises. Social and structural changes are important contributory factors. -from Author",,"air quality; Clean Air Act (1956); empirical analysis; policy effectiveness; pollution control; smoke emission; UK",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041146571

Anaerobic fermentation of untreated and NaOH-treated Parthenium for CH4 production was investigated in 31 semi-continuous fermenters. The experiments included investigation of the effect of retention time, loading rate, feeding frequency and temperature on the steady-state methane production. Results showed that methane yield of 110 ml CH4 g-1 VS added and volumetric methane productivity of 456 ml CH4 l-1 day-1 were obtained for untreated Parthenium at 10 day retention time (HRT), 41.25 g VS l-1 and 30°C. The high lignin content of Parthenium was one of the factors accounting for the low methane yield. Alkali treatment of Parthenium with NaOH significantly enhanced the methane production and cellulose reduction. Results of pretreated fermenters indicated that, at low room temperature (24 ± 2°C), feeding could be done on alternate days, which procedure established a HRT of 20 days and 41.25 g VS l-1 concentration. At 35° and 40°C, the fermenters should be fed daily and operated at a HRT of 10 days and 41.25 g VS l-1. A maximum methane yield of 214 ml CH4 g-1 VS added and methane production of 883 ml CH4 l-1 day-1 were obtained at 10 day HRT and 40°C.

Colorado River water (CRW) and State project water [SPW] from Northern California were treated with ozone alone at applied dosages ranging from 1 to 4 mg/L and with PEROXONE at hydrogen peroxide/ozone (H2O2/O3) ratios of 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30. Ozonation of CRW with applied dosages of 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/L increased AOC concentrations from 70 μg G/L to 275, 350, and 224 μg C/L, respectively. Ozonation of SPW with an applied dosage of 4.0 mg/L elevated AOC concentrations from 70 to 522 μg C/L. In most cases, application of PEROXONE at an H2O2/O3 ratio of 0.05 increased production of AOC by up to 100% in comparison with the use of ozone alone; however, there was no clear relationship between PEROXONE ratios and AOC concentrations. Subsequent filtration through biologically active, dual-media anthracite/sand filters reduced AOC concentrations to levels that were lower than or equal to source - water AOC levels. Continuous chloramination at a dosage of 1.5 mg/L across the filters decreased AOC removal efficiency by 80%, indicating that biological activity is required for AOC reduction. Changing the application points of ozone from prefiltration to post-filtration resulted in at least threefold AOC increases over influent values for both source waters. Similar AOC increases were observed when the treatment process was altered to include both prefiltration and post-filtration ozone application. This indicates that even after biological filtration, there may be sufficient organic material remaining to produce AOC upon ozone or PEROXONE disinfection.

In the Earth carbon is in atmospheric CO2, limestone, other organic products, graphite and trace diamond; interstellar diamond, however, is ubiquitous. Diamond is well known for some unique physical and chemical properties, but it is perhaps less well known that the mineral is geologically ancient (3.3 Ga), that its origins are deep in the mantle (&gt; 180 km), and that diamonds are among the deepest solid objects to reach the surface of the Earth; rare diamonds are from the transition zone (400-670 km), and other diamonds possibly nucleated in the lower mantle (&gt; 670 km). Transport to the surface is in volatile (COHNS)-charged highly explosive kimberlite and lamproite volcanoes. These volcanoes are sited exclusively in the oldest (&gt; 1.7 Ga), tectonically most stable, and thickest (∼ 200 km) regions of crust and upper mantle lithosphere. The energetics required for volcanism are so exceptional and the sources so deep that possible connections between and among the core, geomagnetism, plumes and diamonds are explored. Some correlations are established and others are implied. The results are sufficiently enticing to propose that kimberlites and geographically and temporally associated carbonatites are continental recorders of plumes dating back to at least 2.8 Ga, and that some diamonds may have recorded core events dating back to 3.3 Ga, or possibly earlier. Peaks in kimberlite magmatic activity correlate, on average, with normal and reverse superchron and subchron behavior of the geomagnetic field. The time lag between magnetohydrodynamic activity in the core and kimberlite eruptive cycles at the Earth's surface is of the order of 25-50 Ma, consistent with the travel times modeled for the passage of plumes from D′' layer to the subcontinental lithosphere. Although the existence of plumes and the nature of D′' are debated, the correlations established for the past 500 Ma between and among superchrons, subchrons, kimberlites and entrained diamonds weigh heavily in favor of the following scenario: solid core growth, the consequent release of Si, O, C, H, S, K and possibly N and B to D′', disruption of D′' at some critically unstable threshold thickness (200-300 km), enhanced core convection and the stabilization of a constant non-reversing magnetic dipole field, rising plumes and subsequent volcanism. If protokimberlitic magma and entrainment begin at the core-mantle boundary, a number of geochemical and mineralogical anomalies in diamonds are at present best satisfied if D′' is invoked. These include but are not limited to intensely reduced (i.e., oxygen deficient) SiC, metallic Fe, an abundance of sulfides, silicate perovskite and wüstite-periclase mineral inclusions in diamonds. The most abundant source of diamonds is unequivocally from cratonic root zones with C possibly implanted by ancient plumes; eclogitic suite diamonds are equivocal, and diamonds transported from the transition zone and the lower mantle are best explained by entrainment in highly reduced plumes. Carbon in the overwhelming majority of diamonds appears to be primordial. By analogy with a chondritic Earth and chondrites, carbon was acquired during accretion in gaseous complexes, in the form of nanometer-size amorphous C, and as hydrocarbon particles; but carbon was possibly also added as crystalline nanodiamonds that served as seeds for subsequent diamond growth. © 1994.",,"carbonatite; core; diamond; Earth history; kimberlite; lamproite; mantle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028193268

This star is younger and more active than the Sun. Since no large-scale flare activity was evident in the simultaneous deep-survey EUV photometry, we simulated the spectrum using a solar active region differential emission measure (DEM) together with the plasma emissivity code of Mewe, Gronenschild, &amp; van den Oord (1985). The spectral simulation was normalized to the soft X-ray flux (0.1-2.4 keV) observed during the ROSAT all-sky survey and also the EUVE all-sky survey Lexan/B filter count rate to generate predicted counts in spectral bins in order to identify lines and line blends in the observed spectrum. The difference between these two normalizations was found to be less than 20%. We also compare both the observed and simulated spectra to the Capella observations of Dupree et al. (1993). The accuracy of the emission code and of this spectral simulation is demonstrated by its excellent fit to the high signal-to-noise ratio data in the short-wavelength spectrum of Capella. For χ1 Ori we conclude the following: (1) apart from the He II lines, we do not see many of the expected lines forming at log T ≤ 6.2; (2) in the range log T = 6.3-6.8 we find reasonable agreement with a spectrum simulating the DEM of a solar active region; and (3) material appears to be present at temperature as hot as log T = 7.2 (Fe XXIV).","Stars: coronae; Ultraviolet: stars; X-rays: stars",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044253034

Theoretical and experimental studies have shown that Δ can be negatively correlated with transpiration efficiency (W = seasonal total biomass production/seasonal transpiration) in C3 plants. Consequently, selection for low Δ (and high W) may be useful in breeding C3 plants for some water-limited environments. Development of effective breeding methods depends upon the extent of genotype × environment interaction (G × E) as it influences the consistency of genotypic ranking across environments. Sets of cowpea cultivars and lines were grown under contrasting water supply regimes in subtropical zones in Riverside, California, and Lubbock, Texas, and in tropical zones in Senegal. Leaf carbon isotope composition was measured and significant genotypic differences in Δ were observed in most trials with little G × E for trials within these regions. Genotypic rankings were quite consistent between wetter and drier environments and different years within these regions with significant correlation coefficients for genotypic means in most cases. However, when comparing Δ values between the two subtropical zones (California versus Texas), correlation coefficients for genotypic means only were moderate and not significant. Comparisons of Δ values between the tropical zone (Senegal) and the two subtropical zones indicated no consistency in genotypic ranking, and correlation coefficients for genotypic comparisons were very small. Apparently, G × E for Δ would not necessarily constrain cowpea breeding programs which aim at developing improved cultivars for specific target production regions, such as semiarid tropical Senegal. However, cowpea performance, with respect to Δ and W, would not be transferable to radically different production zones where attainment of high W may require different sets of genes. © 1994.","Cowpea; Transpiration efficiency; Variety trial; Vigna",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028151863

A substantial data base was developed on the composition of diesel emissions; the fate of these emissions in the atmosphere; and the effects of whole particles and their chemical constituents on microorganisms, cells, and animals. Since that time, a number of significant developments have been made in diesel engine technology that require a new look at the future acceptability of introducing significant numbers of light-duty diesel automobiles into the European and American markets. Significant engineering improvements have been made in engine design, catalysts, and traps. As a result, particle emissions and particle associated organic emissions have been reduced by about 10 and 30 times, respectively, during the past 10 years. Research studies to help assess the environmental acceptability of these fuel-efficient engines include the development of an emissions data base for current and advanced diesel engines, the effect of diesel emissions on urban ozone formation and atmospheric particle concentrations, the effect of fuel composition, e.g., lower sulfur and additives on emissions, animal inhalation toxicology studies, and fundamental molecular biology studies.","Catalysts; Diesel; Environment; Health effects; PAH; Particulate traps","diesel fuel; ozone; sulfur; air monitoring; air pollution; car; cell; chemical composition; conference paper; data base; diesel engine; environmental protection; Europe; exhaust gas; health hazard; human; microorganism; molecular biology; motor vehicle; nonhuman; particulate matter; pollution control; priority journal; technology; toxicology; United States; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028028445

The vehicle emissions were measured using the European Motor Vehicle Emissions Group (MVEG) cycle and the U.S. Federal (FTP 75) test procedures. Measured emissions included HC, CO, NO x and particulate mass (PM), C1 to C12 hydrocarbon species (here called light hydrocarbon or LHC), aldehydes, particulate composition and particle size distribution. The particulate composition measurements included soluble organic fraction (SOF), its oil and fuel sub-fractions, and the sulfate fraction. All passenger cars and the light-duty commercial vehicle tested complied with the current European Emissions Directive 91/441/EEC. Two passenger cars achieved the EEC Stage 2 levels, and one nearly met the 1994 Tier I U.S. Federal standards. The LHC accounted for between 35 to 78% of the total HC measured by the heated FID analyzer. Fuel and oil comprised between 12 and 30% of the PM emissions. The non-methane organic gases (NMOG) emissions and the LHC ozone reactivity from diesel cars were both about 50% less than those from gasoline cars. Of the non-regulated emissions, formaldehyde was generally below 0.009 g/km, and benzene emissions were below 0.0035 mg/km. The results were compared with European gasoline vehicles and the Current Gasoline Vehicle fleet of the U.S. Air Quality Improvement Program (AQIRP), and an assessment was made of the relative environmental impacts of gasoline and diesel vehicles. Over the last 20 years, there has been a substantial effort to lower the exhaust emissions from both diesel and gasoline passenger vehicles. Over the same period, the percentage of diesel passenger vehicles purchased in Europe has been increasing steadily(1)*. Lower operating(2) and maintenance costs, and better durability with equivalent drive performance appear mainly responsible for the increased diesel sales. However, even though both diesel and gasoline vehicles meet the current emission standards, questions have arisen about their relative impact on the environment(3). In addition, with future requirements for lower emissions, these questions will undoubtedly continue. The relative environmental impact of diesel and gasoline vehicles is still uncertain because there are relatively few published data on the emissions of current diesel vehicles and because the environmental impacts of the expected emissions are not clearly understood. Data on the regulated emissions for diesel passenger vehicles sold in Europe are available from the German Government:(4) starting in 1991. There are also published reports on regulated emissions from late 1980 and early 1990 diesel cars in the literature(5,6,7). Still there are few reports on the non-regulated emissions from current diesel vehicles(8,9,10). On the other hand, there are substantial published data on the regulated emissions of current gasoline vehicles(11). In addition, there are substantial data on the non-regulated emissions of gasoline cars, especially from the U.S. Air Quality Improvement Research Program (AQIRP)(12). The AQIRP emissions data included measurements of over 150 individual hydrocarbon and aldehydic compounds which allow estimates of the amount of urban ozone formed from the exhaust and of the atmospheric toxic compound levels. Diesel vehicles were not included in AQIRP. This paper reports on detail regulated and non-regulated emissions measurements for six 1992/93 model year diesel vehicles, including two Ford and four competitor vehicles. The emissions were measured on both the 1993 European MVEG cycle and the U. S. Federal test procedure. The U. S. AQIRP analytical methods were used for hydrocarbon and aldehydic speciation. The report discusses the regulated emissions from the six diesel vehicles compared to emissions standards, their contribution to urban ozone formation, toxic levels and global warming. It also compares the exhaust emissions of current diesel and gasoline vehicles to help clarify their relative environmental impact. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air quality; Automobiles; Commercial vehicles; Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Digital storage; Direct injection; Fleet operations; Gasoline; Global warming; Hydrocarbons; Ozone; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Sulfur compounds; Testing; Air quality improvement; Composition measurements; Diesel passenger vehicles; Emission characteristics; Federal test procedures; High speed direct injections; Motor vehicle emissions; Soluble organic fraction; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072429782

However, recent cloning of the two subunits of the DNA-binding form of the AH receptor has shown that this is not the case. These subunits, the AH receptor nuclear translocator protein (ARNT) and the ligand-binding AH receptor monomer, do not contain zinc finger DNA-binding domains, nor do they have any other sequence similarities with members of the above family. Instead, they both contain basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motifs and also another segment of sequence similarity, the ""PAS"" region. bHLH motifs in other transcription factors are known to function as dimerization and DNA-binding domains. Present experiments are directed toward understanding the mechanisms of action and the roles of the two subunits. © 1994.",,"aromatic hydrocarbon; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; dioxin; nuclear protein; receptor subtype; receptor subunit; steroid receptor; thyroid hormone receptor; transcription factor; chemical carcinogenesis; genotoxicity; human; ligand binding; nonhuman; priority journal; protein domain; review",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027948272

It has the approximate composition [Fe4IIIFe2III(OH)12][SO4 · 3H2O], and structurally belongs to the pyroaurite-sjögrenite group of layered hydroxides. From solution data, the standard free energy of formation of GRso4 is estimated to -4380 ± 4 kJ · mol-1. Using this value, the reduction of NO2- to N2O, N2, or NH4+ by GRso4 are thermodynamically spontaneous processes, both under standard state conditions and conditions which can exist in natural anoxic waters. In aqueous solutions at pH 7 and containing FeSO4, K2SO4, NaNO2, and freshly precipitated poorly ordered ferrihydrite two types of redox reactions between Fe(II) and NO2- are operating: (1) rapid reduction of NO2- when Fe2+ reacts with ferrihydrite to form GRso4 and (2) a slower reaction in which NO2- is reduced by Fe(II) in the GRso4 lattice. The major oxidation product is goethite (α-FeOOH). Thus, it appears that the reduction of NO2- by GRso4 is not kinetically hindered. If present in soils and sediments, green rusts may participate in abiotic reduction of NO2-. Further work is in progress to study the kinetics of reduction of NO3-by GRso4. This reaction also is thermodynamically spontaneous. © 1994.",,"free energy of formation; green rust; iron compound; nitrite reduction; sediment; soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028193680

A good correlation (r= 0.81, P &lt; 0.001) was found between physical separation of bacterial and picoalgal cells from fluorescence microscopy and the distribution of heterotrophic metabolic activity between different cell size fractions measured by uptake of 14C‐glucose.  Picoplankton community production was differentiated into the ‘absolute’ autotrophic production by picoalgae, corrected for overestimation due to retention of bacteria with the picoalgae, and the heterotrophic component, bacterial uptake of ‘extracellular organic carbon’ (EOC), derived from the entire phytoplankton community.  The heterotrophic contribution to picoplankton community production ranged from 88 to 1%, mean value 55% of total. Autotrophic picoplankton production was dominant in June and July, but in August and September heterotrophic uptake of EOC was the major input to picoplankton community production.  During the 3 months, the mean contributions to plankton production were autotrophic picoplankton 10.3%, heterotrophic bacterial uptake of EOC 9.7%, EOC in lake water 11.6% and phytoplankton (&gt;3μm) 68.3%.  Bacteria accounted for about half the picopfankton community production via uptake of EOC. Thus although autotrophic picoplankton were ubiquitous, it is likely that their contribution via primary production to the carbon balance of planktonic environments has been overestimated in previous studies.

These deposits comprise a high energy gravelly facies, a mobile sand sheet facies and a low energy muddy sand facies. Such a facies distribution conforms generally with the existing model of continental shelf tidal sedimentation, derived for the west European tidal seas. However, the carbonate rich and mainly warm water deposits of the Australian shelf differ from the mainly quartzose and temperate cold-water deposits of the European type case in terms of: (i) the role of seagrasses in trapping fine-grained sediment; and (ii) the relative importance of the production of carbonate mud by mechanical erosion of carbonate grains. Seagrasses in Spencer Gulf, Gulf of St Vincent and Torres Strait are located in regions of strong tidal currents, associated with bedforms and gravel lag deposits. Thus, in the case of tropical carbonate shelves, seagrass deposits containing fine-grained and poorly sorted sediments are located in close proximity to high energy gravel and mobile sand facies. In contrast, the European model (for temperate, siliciclastic shelves) places facies in a regional gradient with a wide separation (in the order of 50-100 km). Of the locations reviewed, the Gulf of St Vincent, Bass Strait, southern Great Barrier Reef, Torres Strait and Gulf of Carpentaria exhibit zones of carbonate mud accumulation. The production and winnowing of carbonate mud from the mobile sand facies is a factor that must be taken into account in the assessment of a sediment budget for this facies, and which is of relatively greater importance for carbonate shelves. Insufficient data are presently available from the macrotidal North West Shelf to test the applicability of the model to this region.© 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Carbonate sediments; Continental shelf; Seagrass; Siliclastic sediments; Temperate regions; Tidal currents; Tropical regions","carbonate sediments; shelf sedimentation; temperate regions; tidal currents; tropical regions; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028593277

Recent biochemical and molecular biological experiments have provided clear evidence for the existence of multiple auxiliary genes that facilitate nickel incorporation into urease and hydrogenase. Similarly, accessory factors are also likely to be required for the other two enzymes. One of the urease-related genes (ureE) encodes a cytoplasmic protein that has been purified and shown to bind nickel reversibly. We propose that the UreE protein serves as a nickel donor to urease apoprotein. A second urease-related auxiliary gene (ureG) possesses a sequence motif that is found in ATP- and GTP-binding proteins. We have shown that nickel incorporation into urease requires energy and speculate that the UreG protein may serve as an energy transducer, coupling the energy of NTP hydrolysis to metallocenter incorporation. The UreG protein is related in sequence to HypB, a protein that has been proposed to function in nickel processing in hydrogenases. Hence, the mechanisms for metallocenter biosynthesis in these two dissimilar enzymes may have evolved from a common nickel incorporation system. © 1994.","CO dehydrogenase; Hydrogenase; Methyl coenzyme M reductase; Nickel; Urease","carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; hydrogenase; nickel; oxidoreductase; urease; bacterial metabolism; conference paper; enzyme analysis; enzyme mechanism; nonhuman; priority journal; united states; Aldehyde Oxidoreductases; Bacteria; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Hydrogenase; Methanogens; Nickel; Oxidoreductases; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Urease",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028361635

To evaluate trends in blood lead levels among children in Chicago from 1968 through 1988, and to determine the impact of the changes in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) blood lead level of concern. Methods. We reviewed a systematic sample of blood lead screening records of the Chicago Department of Health Laboratory for high-risk children aged 6 months to 5 years. Median blood lead levels for each quarter of the years 1974 through 1988 were determined and regressed against mean air lead levels recorded at air-monitoring stations in Chicago during the same period. Results. Median blood lead levels declined from 30 μg/dL in 1968 to 12 μg/dL in 1988, and were strongly associated with declining average air lead levels (r = .8, P &lt; .001) from 1974 through 1988. A regression model using log-transformed data predicted a decline of 0.56 μg/dL in the median blood lead level with each 0.1 μg/m3 decline in the mean air lead level when the air lead level was near 1.0 μg/m3; the predicted slope was steeper at lower air lead levels. Despite the nearly 20-fold reduction in air lead levels, the median blood lead level of 12 μg/dL in 1988 indicates substantial continuing lead exposure. The CDC blood lead level of concern was lowered twice from 1968 to 1988, but due to the decline in blood lead levels, fewer than 30% of the children were above the level of concern throughout most of the study. Conclusion. Although substantial lead exposure persists in Chicago, reductions in airborne lead emissions seem to have contributed to a long- term decline in the median blood lead level of high-risk Chicago children.","air lead levels; blood lead level of concern; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; lead poisoning; screening; seasonality","lead; air pollution; article; child; environmental exposure; high risk population; human; lead blood level; lead poisoning; priority journal; screening; statistical model; united states; Age Factors; Air Pollutants, Environmental; Chicago; Child, Preschool; Ethnic Groups; Female; Gasoline; Human; Infant; Lead; Male; Regression Analysis; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028082424

Prolonged exposure to high CO2 relieved initially observed inhibition of photosynthesis at least partially. The sensitivity of carbon assimilation to high CO2 was different in different plant species. Acidification by CO2 (or subsequent alkalization) was detected by measuring rapid CO2-release from the tissue and by monitoring fluorescence of pH-indicating dyes which had been fed to the leaves through the petiole. The results indicate that two different mechanisms operate in leaves to achieve and maintain pH homeostasis. Rapid and efficient pH-adjustment is provided by proton/cation exchange across the tonoplast. Slower and less efficient regulation occurs by formation or consumption of base. In the presence of high CO2 concentrations, protons are pumped from the cytosol into already acidic vacuoles. In turn, vacuolar cations replace exported protons in the cytosol permitting bicarbonate accumulation and increasing the pH of the acidified cytosol. Similarly effective and fast proton/cation exchange relieves acid-stress in the chloroplast stroma and permits photosynthesis to proceed with high quantum efficiency or high light-saturated rates in the presence of CO2 concentrations which would, in the absence of fast cytoplasmic pH regulation, inhibit photosynthesis. By inference, proton/cation exchange must also occur across the mitochondrial boundary. After cytoplasmic pH adjustment in the presence of high CO2, removal of CO2 results in transient cytoplasmic alkalization and, subsequently, in the return of cytoplasmic pH values to levels observed prior to acid-stress. In addition to fast pH regulation by rapid proton/cation exchange across biomembranes, slow base production (e.g. NH3-formation) also contributes to relieving acid stress. Base produced in the presence of high CO2 is rapidly consumed after removal of CO2.Implications of the findings in regard to forest damage by potentially acidic air pollutants such as SO2 are briefly discussed. © 1994 The Japanese Society of Plant Physiologists (JSPP).","Acid stress; Fluorescent pH indicators; Leaves; PH regulation; Photosynthesis; Proton/cation exchange",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028156086

A significant factor in this respect is not only the conversion in the cold start phase, but also improvement of conversion at vehicle operating temperatures [1]. For example, in order to achieve ULEV values in compliance with Californian emission standards at an assumed raw engine out emission of 2.0 HC g/m, a conversion rate of 98 % in the overall testing is imperative [2]. Parallel to reduced emissions legislation will also require a lower specific fuel consumption [3]. The loss of engine power from increased exhaust gas back pressure in addition to larger space requirement for a catalytic converter in the engine compartment resulting from such measures are of critical importance. With the aid of a special method of structuring the channels, the so-called transversal structure (TS), it is possible to increase the effectiveness of the catalyst by increasing the transverse flow of the gas in the channels. The paper will demonstrate that by reducing the cell density, the increased pressure resulting from the TS design can be compensated for or even overcompensated by a simultaneous increase in effectiveness. The reduced heat capacity of the matrix structure demonstrated in this variant improves the light-off behaviour of the catalytic converter. The TS design also presents the possibility of reducing the catalyst volume for applications with restricted space allowances whilst retaining identical effectiveness. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Catalysts; Regulatory compliance; Specific heat; Catalytic conversion efficiencies; Emissions legislation; Engine compartments; Engine-out emissions; Operating temperature; Specific fuel consumption; Transversal structures; United States of America; Catalytic converters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072446250

This interactive vegetation climate model has been used to conduct two complementary CO2‐doubling experiments: an instantaneous 2 x CO2 simulation (15 years in total) and a fast, transiently increasing CO2 simulation (45 years in total). There are some differences in the predicted vegetation distributions and areas. However, there is agreement that in a warmed world the vegetation type termed ‘agriculture’ increases in area at the expense of deciduous needle‐leaf trees and short grass; and the tundra extent, already underestimated, decreases further whereas deserts and the deciduous broadleaf tree areas expand. The overall vegetation areas predicted are not particularly sensitive to initialization, although effects of different initialization can be monitored for 1–2 years. On the other hand, when the sensitivity of the modelled climate to the inclusion of some aspects of an interactive biosphere is examined, it is found that annually updated continental characteristics do not disrupt the climate simulation but do modify zonal temperatures and precipitation and increase continental evaporation. The latter intensifies the Hadley circulation, especially in July, and, thus, leads to increased evaporation globally. These results, if corroborated by other similar studies, indicate that simple, post facto application of vegetation diagnostic schemes once climatic equilibrium is achieved may be diagnosing vegetation from an incorrect climatic state.

We compared the effects of CO2 enrichment on both single-leaf and whole-canopy photosynthetic rates in cotton. We also determined whole-canopy photosynthetic and transpiration rates in cotton in response to CO2 enrichment and differential irrigation. Field-grown cotton was exposed to either 550 μmol mol-1 of CO2 using the free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) system or to 370 μmol mol-1 in control plots. In the second year of the experiment, half of each plot received reduced levels of irrigation. Rates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of single leaves were determined using a portable photosynthesis system and a portable steady-state porometer, respectively. Rates of whole-canopy photosynthesis and transpiration were determined using a custom-built chamber (about 1 m × 1 m). Midday net photosynthetic rates of both leaves and canopies were 19-41% higher in the CO2-enriched plots than in control plots. The CO2 effect on leaf photosynthesis was greatest in July, whereas the CO2 effect on canopy photosynthesis was greatest in June and decreased thereafter as mutual shading of leaves and the amount of non-photosynthetic biomass increased. Midday stomatal conductance values of leaves were 13-44% greater in control plants than in CO2-enriched plants. Except for late in the second season, canopy transpiration rates were not affected by the CO2 treatment because the decrease in stomatal conductance was offset by an increase in plant size. Differential irrigation led to no significant differences in either canopy photosynthesis or transpiration, possibly because differential irrigation was applied only during the second half of the season. It appears that cotton crops grown in a future, higher-CO2 climate may have increased photosynthetic rates, but water requirements may not be reduced. © 1994.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000130304

Assuming equilibrium reactions between injected HCl and calcium carbonate in a sandstone formation, we developed a numerical model of HCl frontal movement in the radial direction from the wellbore and added it to an existing sandstone acidizing simulator. In general, only small preflush volumes (as little as 25 gal/ft can be adequate) are needed to prevent live HF from coming in contact with high-pH regions. In almost all treatments, however, spent HF will penetrate beyond the live HCl front; larger HCl preflushes displace the region where spent HF comes in contact with undissolved carbonates in the formation farther from the wellbore. The new simulator predicts the distribution of HCl and HF in a multilayered formation with damage around the wellbore. Using this model, we investigated the required size of the HCl preflush for a range of initial concentrations of HCl and carbonate. We also studied the influence of fluid diversion on the HCl frontal locations in multilayered reservoirs for multiple sequence treatments. In particular, we simulated treatments where HCl was injected without diversion, followed by an HF/HCl sequence including diverting agent to determine whether the HF would be diverted to regions that had not been reached by HCl.",,"Hydrochloric acid; Hydrofluoric acid; Injection (oil wells); Mathematical models; Oil bearing formations; Sandstone; Acid distribution; Hydrochloric acid preflush; Multilayered formations; Sandstone acidizing; Acidization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028438480

In the simplest case, the social cost of additional emissions at a location then equals: (1) The allowance price plus (2) the external cost of those emissions minus the external costs avoided because emissions at other locations decrease. Emissions elsewhere must decrease because the total number of allowances is fixed. Since allowances are an internal cost, the appropriate adder is just the second quantity. Its value can be positive or negative. If negative, this implies that the local state regulatory commission should encourage emissions in its jurisdiction because they cause less damages then if emitted elsewhere. The general result is unaffected by the presence of local emission restrictions.

How might those rate increases affect consumer fuel choices, and how important could the environmental consequences of those end-user fuel-mix changes be? A comprehensive planning model is used to address these questions for one utility, Seattle City Light. Programs to decrease the greenhouse gas CO2 are evaluated. The conclusion is that rate increases due to implementation of environmental policies will dampen demands, resulting in lower utility costs and environmental effects, even though residential customers would use somewhat more oil, natural gas, and wood as a result of rate increases. However, rate feedback also results in losses of “customer value”—the benefit consumers receive from consuming electricity. This value loss can partially or entirely offset the benefits of rate increases. © ASCE.",,"electricity generation; emission cost; energy planning; environmental economics; planning model; rate feedback; USA, Washington State, Seattle; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electric power utilization; Electric rates; Environmental impact; Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Emission cost trade offs; Environmental policy; Greenhouse gas; Rate feedback; Electric utilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028665982

The influence of adsorbent dosage levels, particle size, and the presence of buffer solution components, other electrolytes, and pH on the kinetics of adsorption of nitrophenol have been investigated. For some adsorbents, pH changes in the acidic region appear to have little influence on adsorption rates of nitrophenol, but for chars, reduced pH conditions appear to reduce adsorption rates. In the alkaline pH range, leaching from some of the adsorbents occurs, with the extent of leaching reducing as the carbon content of the adsorbent increases. Adsorption capacities for Yallourn coal, grus, briquette char and power station char using nitrophenol in phosphate buffer have been measured. The technique of differential pulse polarography has been shown to be useful as a means of measuring nitrophenol adsorption in situ for concentrations up to 30 mg l-1. © 1994.","adsorbent; brown coal; nitrophenol","Adsorbents; Adsorption; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Leaching; pH effects; Phenols; Polarographic analysis; Reaction kinetics; Solutions; Adsorbent dosage levels; Differential pulse polarography; Nitrophenols; Lignite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028752728

Steady state polarization measurements were made using the current-interrupt method to compensate for the potential drop caused by ohmic resistance, mainly in the electrode. Tafel slopes of 130-280 mV decade-1 were observed spanning 2-3 decades of current. At high overpotentials, the (transport-compensated) kinetic-limiting current invariably approached a constant value. The reaction order with respect to the O2 concentration was determined to be unity. In perchlorate solutions, an overall four-electron reduction process was observed, with only a weak dependence on pH. In carbonate solutions, O2 reduction currents were suppressed by up to an order of magnitude (compared with those in perchlorate) and copious amounts of peroxide were released to solution. The theory developed by Presnov and Trunov for O2 reduction on transition metal oxides with p-type semiconductivity was adapted to interpret the results for UO2. Variations in the number density of surface donor-acceptor sites as a function of applied potential can then be invoked to explain a diverse range of experimental observations. These claims are consistent with the conclusions of previous voltammetric experiments, which showed that the degree of oxidation of the UO2 surface changes substantially over the region of Tafel behaviour for O2 reduction. © 1994.","Hydrogen peroxide; Neutral solutions; Oxygen reduction; Ring-disc electrodes; Uranium dioxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003370683

Western blot experiments show that both MAbs specifically cross-react with an ~85-kDa band in cytosol prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with the full length human Arnt cDNA pBMSNeo-D24-1 and in Hepa 1c1c7 cytosol but not in Arnt-deficient Hepa 1-C4 mutant cytosol.

Stokes radius, and relative molecular mass of Arnt as ~3.6-4.1 S, 6.8 nm, and 101-115 kDa, respectively.

The establishment of the nuclear localization of Arnt in human and murine cell lines shown here indicates that its nuclear localization may be conserved across species.

The presence of particulate matter in the exhaust gas, however, has ""tarnished"" the diesel engine's image. Soiling, visibility reduction and potential health effects are some of the problems being associated with diesel particulates. Extremely stringent U.S. and European heavy-duty on-highway standards have been implemented, resulting in clean burning diesel engines for truck and bus applications. Some engines are just below, or slightly exceed, the legislated particulate standards. Meanwhile, the U.S. EPA, the State of California and the European countries have developed (or are in the process of developing) exhaust emission regulations for industrial engines, to be implemented in the mid/late 1990s, which also contain particulate standards. Having recognized the need for particulate filters as a retrofit solution for existing engines as well as an after-treatment device for new engines in applications such as city buses or in-door operation of industrial equipment, DEUTZ SERVICE began the development of particulate traps in the mid 1980s.

The model used included 24 explicit lipid molecules and explicit waters of solvation in the polar head group regions, together with constant-pressure periodic boundary conditions in three dimensions. Using this model, a MD simulation samples part of an infinite planar lipid bilayer. The lipid dynamics and packing behavior were characterized. Furthermore, using the results of the simulations, a number of diverse properties including bilayer structural parameters, hydrocarbon chain order parameters, dihedral conformations, electron density profile, hydration per lipid, and water distribution along the bilayer normal were calculated. Many of these properties are available for the three lipid systems chosen, making them well suited for evaluating the model and protocols used in these simulations by direct comparisons with experimental data. The calculated MD behavior, chain disorder, and lipid packing parameter, i.e. the ratio of the effective areas of hydrocarbon tails and head group per lipid (a/ah), correctly predict the aggregation preferences of the three lipids observed experimentally at 37°C, namely: a gel bilayer for DLPE, a hexagonal tube for DOPE, and a liquid crystalline bilayer for DOPC. In addition, the model and conditions used in the MD simulations led to good agreement of the calculated properties of the bilayers with available experimental results, demonstrating the reliability of the simulations. The effects of the cis unsaturation in the hyd-rocarbon chains of DOPE and DOPC, compared to the fully saturated one in DLPE, as well as the effects of the different polar head groups of PC and PE with the same unsaturated chains on the lipid packing and bilayer structure have been investigated. The results of these studies indicate the ability of MD methods to provide molecular-level insights into the structure and dynamics of lipid assemblies. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"hydrocarbon; membrane phospholipid; article; chemical structure; membrane structure; molecular dynamics; molecular model; phospholipid bilayer; priority journal; simulation; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Lipid Bilayers; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Phosphatidylcholines; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Stereoisomerism; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028341886

This paper presents a comprehensive emissions control model which can systematically examineall available emissions control options and constructan optimal compliance plan. The model is a nonlinear integer program that uses probabilistic production costing to simulate system generation. A solution procedure based on Generalized Benders Decomposition(GBD) is developed, exploiting the special structure of the problem formulation. The GBD solution procedure employs an efficient method to calculate the derivatives of the expected generation of a unit with respect to the capacity of another unit. The model is applied to a utility system to construct least-cost compliance strategies under a range of prices of allowances.

Among the responsibilities that the nations which ratify the Convention will have are the drawing up of inventories of greenhouse gas sources and sinks and the formulation of national strategies to respond to climate change through adaptive and or preventive measures. One requirement for identifying appropriate response strategies will be the undertaking of regional assessments of climate change and its associated impacts. This paper is concerned with climate change in the East Asian region, both over the last 100 years (using instrumental data) and also for the next 100 years (using results from climate model experiments). The juxtaposing of these two analyses, historical and future, enables a better interpretation of the significance of regional climate change to be made. Instrumental temperature and precipitation data for the East Asian region are analysed and compared with the observed global‐scale trends in these two variables. Although the region has undoubtedly warmed over the last century, understanding the exact causes of the complex seasonal, diurnal, and spatial dimensions of this warming is difficult. We examine the role of increasing urbanization in inducing rising temperatures and suggest that, although substantial, urban warming cannot account for all of the observed temperature change. The paper also illustrates a flexible composite‐model approach to regional climate change scenario construction that avoids the need for multiple transient GCM experiments, which can explicitly incorporate the effects of intermodel uncertainty, and is flexible enough to incorporate new scientific findings and results from new GCM experiments. The scenario presented here suggests that by 2050, mean conditions are expected to be warmer than the extremely warm seasonal anomalies that occurred during the most recent decade in East Asia. Precipitation is estimated to rise over most of the region in all seasons, although the uncertainty range attached to this estimate is much wider than for temperature.

The latter aspect has received increasing attention. The prospect of future global‐mean warming due to greenhouse gas emissions adds a further dimension to the problem. Correct analysis and interpretation of climate variability over Africa, and its linkages with the global climate system, are important if appropriate resource management policies, targeted aid strategies and economic re‐structuring are to be implemented. This article briefly discusses some examples of how information about climate variability in Africa has been used in the context of seasonal rainfall forecasting, regional drought impacts, the International Negotiating Committees of the forthcoming Desertification Convention and the existing (and soon to be ratified) UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Resumé Le climat: le déploiement des informations météorologiques en Afrique: exemples relatifs à la sécheresse, aux prévisions pluviales et à l'échauffement de la planète L'importante influence du climat sur la distribution et l'utilisation des ressources naturelles de l'Afrique résulte d'une part de son état normal ‘moyen’ et aussi, de la variabilité diachronique du climat. Cette variabilité temporelle reçoit de plus en plus d'attention. La perspective d'une augmentation de léchauffement de la planète en raison des émissions de gaz contributeurs à l'effet de serre présente une autre dimension à ce problème. L'analyse et l'interprétation correctes de la variabilité du climat sur l'Afrique entière, ainsi que ses rapports avec le système météorologique en général, seront importantes si l'on veut mettre en place des politiques de gestion des ressources appropriées, des stratégies d'aide correctement ciblées, ainsi qu'une restructuration globale de l'économie. Dans cet article, l'auteur offre une brève discussion de certains exemples de la manière par laquelle l'information concernant la variabilité météorologique en Afrique a été exploitée dans le contexte des prévisions saisonnières de pluvialité, de l'impact régional des sécheresses, des Comités internationaux de négociation de la prochaine Convention sur la désertification, et le projet actuel de Convention des Nations‐Unies (dont la ratification est attendue) sur les Changements climatiques. Resumen El uso de la información climatica en África: ejemplos relacionados con sequías, pronósticos de lluvias y el calentamiento global La gran influencia del clima en la distribución y utilización de los recursos naturales del África ocurre tanto a través de su término medio como de su variabilidad temporal. Este último aspecto va recibiendo creciente atención. Las posibilidades del calentamiento global medio debido a las emisiónes de gas del efecto invernadero añaden una dimensión extra al problema. El análisis y la interpretación correctos de la variabilidad del clima en todo el continente africano y sus conexiónes con el sistema climático global son importantes a la hora de implementar normas adecuadas para el manejo de recursos, estructuras de ayuda y reestructuración económica.

Information about the inhomogeneity of these distributions within the near-surface region sampled by XPS was obtained by angle-resolved measurements in which the position of the analyzer axis was varied with respect to the surface normal. These experiments demonstrated that (1) sputtering with 2 keV ions produced a surface containing Ti cations in the 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+, but not 0 oxidation states; (2) these were reoxidized in a roughly sequential fashion as the surface was annealed to 750 K, at which temperature reoxidation to Ti4+ was complete; and (3) the average oxidation state of the topmost layers of the ion-bombarded surface was slightly higher than that determined from XPS spectra collected normal to the surface. Since the surfaces reduced by argon ion bombardment are active for organic assembly processes, including reductive coupling of aldehydes to form symmetric olefins, these surface characterization results demonstrate that Ti0 sites are not required to effect reductive coupling, in contrast to conclusions from previous slurry-phase studies. These observations enhance the possibility that reductive carbonyl coupling might be rendered catalytic, since a smaller cycle of oxidation states is required than previously recognized. © 1994 J.C.

This part of the paper moves on to examine the carbon tax proposal and its evolution since 1990. The second part of the paper addresses the specific role which business played in influencing the development of the carbon tax proposal. The general strategy of business was to block the proposal entirely. The paper identifies the potential impacts of the tax on business, implications for corporate strategies and the specific channels through which business influenced the tax proposal, by participating in public debates, through representations to different directorates of the European Commission or by making a case to national authorities. The final part of the paper attempts to draw some lessons about: the business position in relation to large scale environmental problems such as climate change; business responses to economic instruments such as the carbon/energy tax; and the wider relationship between public authorities and business in regulatory processes.

Many automobile manufacturers are aware of the importance of a filtration system to improve cabin air quality. This can be seen by the increasing number of vehicles being produced with such systems in Europe and Japan. The air in the interior of a vehicle contains particulate and gaseous pollutants such as dust, pollen, soot, tobacco smoke, hydrocarbons, oxides of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen (e.g., CO, SO 2, NO2), and ozone. To effectively reduce the level of particulate matter entering the vehicle's ventilation system, filters using electrostatically charged media have become the industry standard due to their combination of high particle capture efficiencies, low pressure drop and long life. In combination with these, filters for effectively removing gaseous pollutants are also being developed. The factors affecting the performance of gas removal filters are complex and to properly evaluate their performance a practical, yet technically sound test method must be used. A significant effort has been put forth to understand these factors and a useful test method for measuring filter performance has been developed. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air quality; Automobile manufacture; Bandpass filters; Fog; Particles (particulate matter); Testing; Vehicles; Ventilation; Automobile manufacturers; Electrostatically charged; Filtration systems; Gaseous pollutants; Industry standards; Number of vehicles; Particulate Matter; Ventilation systems; Air filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072428308

Estrogens, estradiol, hexestrol (HEX) and diethylstilbestrol (DES) were given s.c. to rats daily for 3 days from the first day of diestrus, and hCG was given s.c. at 3:00 p.m. on the day of expected proestrus. The ovaries were isolated on the day of expected estrus. Ovarian CR activity was measured by using two substrates that reflect the activity of the enzyme in rats, and the enzyme content was determined by western blot analysis. Ovarian CR activity and content were decreased by estrogens as well as by inhibition of ovulation; hCG restored both the activity and the content decreased by estrogens to levels produced by nGC alone. Nevertheless, the number of ova in the oviduct when ovulation was decreased or blocked by estrogens was not restored completely by hCG treatment. Faint immunostaining in the interstitial gland cells of HEX-treated rat ovaries was observed. These results suggest that (i) although hCG activates ovarian CR in estrogen-treated rats, this increase in both enzyme activity and content may not be an obligatory event in the ovulatory process, and (ii) exogenous estrogens may predominantly influence the ovarian CR in the interstitial gland cells in mature rats by inhibiting luteinizing hormone release from the pituitary. © 1994.","carbonyl reductase; estrogen; hCG; immunochemistry; rat ovary","carbonyl reductase; chorionic gonadotropin; diethylstilbestrol; estradiol; estrogen; hexestrol; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme localization; female; immunoblotting; immunohistochemistry; nonhuman; ovary; ovulation; priority journal; rat; subcutaneous drug administration; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Animal; Body Weight; Chorionic Gonadotropin; Enzyme Activation; Estrogens; Estrogens, Synthetic; Female; Organ Weight; Ovary; Ovulation; Rats; Rats, Inbred WKY",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028277988

Positive immunoreactive protein to anti-CR-A antibody was found in mouse, hamster, and rabbit adrenal gland, whereas that to anti-CR-K2 antibody was present only in rat adrenal gland. AR-H and AR-L mainly reduced aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes. All the aldo-keto reductases from rat adrenal gland were completely inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. Barbiturate and 3,3'-tetramethylene glutarate potently inhibited AR-H, and quercitrin significantly decreased the activity of CR-K1, CR-K2, and AR-L. We propose that these aldo-keto reductases may play important roles in the rat adrenal functions. © 1994 BY THE JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY.","Adrenal gland; Aldo-keto reductase; Carbonyl reductase; Immunochemistry; Rat","13,14 dihydro 15 oxoprostaglandin f2 alpha; 4 chloromercuribenzoic acid; aldehyde; aldehyde reductase; barbituric acid derivative; carbonyl reductase; oxidoreductase; oxidoreductase inhibitor; quercitrin; tetramethyleneglutaric acid; adrenal gland; animal tissue; article; enzyme activity; enzyme purification; enzyme specificity; female; hamster; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; mouse; nerve cell; nonhuman; rabbit; rat; zona glomerulosa; Adrenal Cortex; Adrenal Medulla; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Aldehyde Reductase; Animal; Cross Reactions; Female; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Immunochemistry; Isoenzymes; Male; Rats; Rats, Inbred WKY; Substrate Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028243397

Predicting the likely effects of global change on forests is extremely difficult due to the critical lack of information on regional changes in meteorological factors relevant to forests. However, existing models of forest production and forest distribution fail to take adequate account of what is already known. Climate and carbon dioxide concentrations have shown substantial changes over the last 100 years. Although the rate of change is likely to increase, recent proposed and implemented control strategies, together with better climatic models, are tending to suggest that the rate of change will be less than initially thought. This means that past changes may provide an increasingly useful source of information. In particular, information on the impact on forests of both long-term climate change and short-term climatic events is rapidly increasing. Such information should be built into future forest response models. © 1993.","climate change; drought; forest distribution; forest production; temperate forests","climatic change; forest; temperate forest; carbon dioxide; climate; conference paper; forest; forestry; greenhouse effect; meteorological phenomena",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028184557

It is shown that P+ is first excited into a metal to ligand charge transfer state (MLCT) in which the charge is localized on the bpy ligand, resulting in an upward shift in the v(CO) bands. This excited state is quenched by 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane to form the neutral species P with lowered v(CO) infrared bands; there is a rapid back-reaction between P and DABCO.

Ltd.","In the fields of the internal combustion engines for automobile and marine use, higher output power, higher efficiency and lower fuel consumption are strongly expected. The problems of environment such as a global greenhouse effect or an acid rain is getting worse. Therefore the exhaust gas regulations had been introduced and being strengthen in the USA, Europe and Japan. These regulations demand the reduction of NOx and particulate matter(PM) from diesel exhaust gas at the same time. The turbocharging has been more important technique for these regulations. For automobile engines, it is common to use the pulse turbocharging system for compactness and advantage of response. The characteristics of compressor and turbine are different from under steady state condition by pulsating flow. Especially, it is difficult to estimate the performance of turbine mounted on engine by using the map measured under steady state flow. It is the key point to know the difference of characteristics between on engine condition and steady state condition. It helps one to develop the high performance turbocharging and to select the optimum turbocharger specification. Many researchers had been investigated the characteristics of turbocharger under non-steady flow conditions(2),(4)∼(8). The most of them used the pulse generator to simulate the exhaust pulse of engine. They relate the characteristics of turbocharger on engine condition to steady state performances with quasi steady state method. For this method, they use the instantaneous turbine inlet and outlet pressure, temperature and mass flow rate. These approaches, which use the instantaneous data, are not suitable to one, who wants to select the turbocharger specification to a target engine. Usually they cannot get such data. They can get the information such as number of cylinders and type of exhaust manifold arrangement. It is desirable that they can estimate the turbocharger performance on the engine without any instantaneous data. Authors used the actual engines instead of a pulse generator to compare the flow and efficiency characteristics between on engine condition and steady state condition. From results of these approaches, it is found that engines having the same exhaust system have the same tendency of mass flow and efficiency correction coefficient for the turbine expansion ratio. From results of the measurements of degree of reaction in a turbine scroll, the amplitude of variation measured on engine is greater than for steady state flow. It means that the estimate with quasi steady state approach for non-steady state flow condition brings some errors. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Acid rain; Efficiency; Fuel consumption; Gases; Greenhouse effect; Internal combustion engines; Marine engines; Mass transfer; Pulse generators; Specifications; Steady flow; Superchargers; Turbines; Correction coefficients; Efficiency characteristic; Particulate Matter; Quasi-steady state; Steady state performance; Steady-state condition; Steady-state flows; Turbocharging systems; Exhaust systems (engine)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072424785

We have performed time-resolved measurements of the same structure. Emission processes excited high above the band (off-resonantly excited) were measured to be of the order of 50 ps. Emission from resonant excitation is complete in less than 15 ps. A simple model explains the quantitative features observed. The planar microcavity structure of Ref. 1 1 was optically pumped by a self-mode locked Ti-Al2O3 laser producing 100-200-fs pulses at 5° - 6° from normal incidence at T = 4 K. The specularly reflected pump beam was blocked, and the cavity emission normal to the surface was directed to a streak camera for analysis. The temporal resolution of the camera was measured to be 10 ps when it was directly illuminated with a subpicosecond pulse. A pass band in the DBR structure allowed the device to be pumped either high above the band at 775 nm (off-resonant pumping) or on resonance at 808 nm. A small amount of reflected pump light was directed to the streak camera in order to set the zero of time. Off-resonant pumping generates non-optically-active excitons that scatter through phonon mediated processes to the bottom of the band before they can emit. Phonon scattering yields an ensemble of excitons that are mutually incoherent. These processes lead to a delay time of some 25 ps before emission is seen and an emission FWHM of 23 ps (see Fig. 1). These results are as fast as the fastest emission times seen in resonantly excited GaAs quantum wells. Resonant excitation of the microcavity structure (see Fig. 2) shows that the entire emission process is complete in less than 15 ps. We believe the enhancement to be due to the creation of an ensemble of mutually coherent excitons that have a collective dipole moment much larger than that of a single exciton. This large dipole is selected by the microcavity.",,"Band structure; Cameras; Coherent light; Excitons; Laser beams; Light emission; Lighting; Optical pumping; Phonons; Semiconducting aluminum compounds; Semiconductor quantum wells; Solid state lasers; Coherent emission; Off resonant pumping; Phonon scattering; Pump beam; Semiconductor microcavity; Streak camera; Cavity resonators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028589808

Because of the ubiquitous use and benefits of CFCs and halons, an expeditious search for safe replacements to meet the legislative deadlines is of critical importance. Toxicity testing and health risk assessment programs were established to evaluate the health and environmental impact of these replacement chemicals. Development and implementation of these programs as well as the structural‐activity relationships significant for the development of the replacement chemicals are described below. A dose‐response evaluation for the health risk assessment of the replacement chemical HCFC‐123 (2,2‐dichloro‐1,1,1‐trifluoroethane) is also presented to show an innovative use of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. This is based on a parallelogram approach using data on the anesthetic gas halothane, a structural analog to HCFC‐123. Halothane and HCFC‐123 both form the same metabolite, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), indicative of the same metabolic oxidative pathway attributed to hepatotoxicity. The parallelogram approach demonstrates the application of template model structures and shows how PBPK modeling, together with judicious experimental design, can be used to improve the accuracy of health risk assessment and to decrease the need for extensive laboratory animal testing.

The regulation of the two major acidic extracellular proteases, pepA and pepB, was investigated using Northern analyses. Our data suggest that the regulation of pepA and pepB expression occurs predominantly at the level of mRNA content and that, while they are regulated in a similar manner, differences are also clear in their expression. Both genes were found to be under complex regulatory control. The expression of the two genes could be turned off by the presence of good nitrogen or carbon sources in the media, and external protein sources did not induce expression of either gene under conditions of carbon and nitrogen repression. The pH of the medium also played a major role in their regulation as the expression of both genes was completely turned off under alkaline conditions, even when grown in media lacking good nitrogen and carbon sources but containing proteins. We isolated clones containing 5′ non-coding sequences of the pepA gene from a λ genomic library with a pepA specific probe. Analysis and comparison of the promoter sequences of the pepA and pepB genes revealed that both contain several putative AREA- and CREA-binding sites and they also share an 18-bp-long sequence which is 83% identical in these two genes. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon repression; Nitrogen repression; pH regulation transcription","acid proteinase; carbon; messenger rna; nitrogen; article; aspergillus niger; enzyme regulation; enzyme synthesis; gene expression regulation; nonhuman; northern blotting; nucleotide sequence; ph; priority journal; promoter region; protein synthesis regulation; sequence homology; Aspartic Endopeptidases; Aspergillus niger; Base Sequence; Carbon; DNA; DNA Probes; DNA, Fungal; Endopeptidases; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genes, Fungal; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Molecular Sequence Data; Nitrogen; Promoter Regions (Genetics); RNA; RNA, Fungal; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Aspergillus niger",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028093358

Microdialysis in the cisterna magna of Sprague-Dawley rats was used to assess the ability of furosemide and ethacrynic acid (i.e. loop agents that interfere directly with cotransport) to inhibit 36Cl transport from blood to CSF over a 3-h period. Cl uptake by CSF was quantified as % volume of distribution (Vd) of 36Cl, i.e. 100 × cpm/g CSF ÷ cpm/ml plasma. Uptake curves of Vd vs. time were constructed for the various treatments; then, to compare drug effects, the curves were analyzed for: (i) the early slope of uptake (Kd), (ii) the steady-state value for Vd, and (iii) the area-under-curve (AUC). Assessment of the curve parameters collectively revealed that at 5 mg/kg, both furosemide (FUR) and ethacrynic acid (EA) reduced Cl penetration into CSF by one quarter; at 50 mg/kg, these loop agents decreased Cl uptake by about a third. On the other hand, 50 mg/kg of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, reduced Cl uptake into CSF by 55-60%. Thus, NaCl cotransport inhibitors maximally reduced Cl transport in the rat by about 35%; this inhibition was less extensive than that brought about by acetazolamide, which interferes with CSF secretion by a different mechanism. © 1994.","Acetazolamide; Cerebrospinal fluid; Cisternal microdialysis; Ethacrynic acid; Furosemide; Loop diuretics","acetazolamide; diuretic agent; etacrynic acid; furosemide; loop diuretic agent; animal experiment; article; cerebrospinal fluid; chloride transport; choroid plexus; controlled study; male; microdialysis; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; Acetazolamide; Animal; Biological Transport; Blood Pressure; Cerebral Ventricles; Chlorides; Choroid Plexus; Cisterna Magna; Ethacrynic Acid; Furosemide; Male; Microdialysis; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028278610

NQO1 is ubiquitously expressed. However, a large amount of variation in NQO1 gene expression was noticed among various human tissues. NQO1 gene is upregulated in livers of hepatocarcinoma patients, and its expression is induced in response to a variety of compounds, including planar aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolic antioxidants/chemoprotectors, tumor promoters, and hydrogen peroxide. Deletion mutagenesis in the NQO1 gene promoter identified several cis-elements including antioxidant response element (ARE), xenobiotic response element, and AP2 element, which regulate the expression and induction of the NQO1 gene. Among these DNA elements, ARE is the most important cis-element required for high basal expression of the NQO1 gene in tumor tissues, as compared to the normal tissues of the same origin, and for its induction in response to xenobiotics and antioxidants. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the ARE indicated presence of three AP1/AP1- like elements and a GCA box. Mutational analysis indicated a requirement of two AP1/AP1-like elements arranged as inverse repeats at the interval of three base pairs for the ARE activity. The GCA box in the ARE was required for optimum basal and induced expression. ARE is a novel cis-element because a single AP1/AP1-like element did not stimulate gene expression in response to xenobiotics and antioxidants. Band shift and supershift assays identified Jun, Fos, and novel proteins in the hARE-nuclear protein complexes that mediate regulation of the NQO1 gene expression. A hypothetical model to study the mechanism of signal transduction from xenobiotics and antioxidants to the ARE resulting into activation of the NQO1 and other phase II enzyme genes is described. Evidence is presented to demonstrate the role of the NQO1 in preventing the binding of P450 reductase-activated benzo(a)pyrene quinones (semiquinones) to the DNA, presumably by eliminating their formation.","bioreductive drugs; chemoprevention; DT- diaphorase; expression; metabolism; quinone oxidoreductase; regulation","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; 5 (1 aziridinyl) 3 hydroxymethyl 2 (3 hydroxy 1 propenyl) 1 methyl 4,7 indoledione; antineoplastic antibiotic; antioxidant; aromatic hydrocarbon; benzo[a]pyrene derivative; cadmium chloride; complementary dna; dicoumarol; dithiothreitol; hydrogen peroxide; isothiocyanic acid; mercaptoethanol; mitomycin c; oncoprotein; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; quinone derivative; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) dehydrogenase (quinone); regulator protein; zinc chloride; animal cell; conference paper; dna binding; drug dna interaction; drug metabolism; enzyme activity; gene expression regulation; gene mutation; human; human tissue; liver cell carcinoma; nonhuman; northern blotting; nucleotide sequence; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; promoter region; signal transduction; tissue specificity; Animal; Base Sequence; Benzopyrenes; Biotransformation; Comparative Study; Cytochrome Reductases; DNA, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Haplorhini; Human; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis; NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone); Neoplasms; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028653618

Energy transfer from the excited state to the carbon surface greatly reduced the fluorescence of rhodamine 6G and the near-IR laser dye IR125, and Raman spectra with high S/N were obtained from the adsorbed molecules. Strong resonance enhancement of Raman scattering was observed, and monolayer films of R6G were observed. R6G exhibited Langmuirian adsorption behavior, with saturation coverage occuring at #x223C;0.5 mM in methanol. The technique was also successfully applied to bis(methylstyryl)benzene (BMB) and fluoranthene, which are less fluorescent but also much weaker scatterers. Since the laser wavelengths yielding resonance enhancement are in the same range as those producing fluorescence, adsorption to carbon permits elimination of fluorescence without loss of resonance enhancement. The porous graphite substrate has the added advantage of high microscopic surface area, low elastic background, and propensity to adsorb a wide range of organic materials. With care, it was possible to observe Raman features from monolayers of materials having cross sections comparable to that of benzene, such as the 1205 cm−1 peak of BMB. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

However, the quantitative relationship between gasoline composition and exhaust hydrocarbon has not been clarified. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of individual hydrocarbons in gasoline and to clarify the effect of the gasoline composition on engine-out exhaust hydrocarbons. Experiments were performed on a single cylinder research engine operating under steady state condition. The test fuels were blended gasolines of alkylate, catalytic reformate and fluid catalytic cracking gasoline. Chemically defined binary fuel mixtures of isooctane, benzene, toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene were used as variables to study their impact on exhaust hydrocarbons. The individual exhaust hydrocarbon species were analyzed using a gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector (FID). The results of tests with blended gasoline indicated that the exhaust hydrocarbons were classified into the unburned fuel and the cracked products such as methane, ethane and various olefins. The unburned fuel of over C4 paraffins and aromatics in the exhaust was proportional to each fuel component. The regression analysis between fuel and exhaust hydrocarbons yielded the following results. The percentage of individual hydrocarbon in THC was expressed as a function of paraffin, olefin and aromatic contents in fuel. The ""production coefficient"" defined as the proportional constant was obtained. The production coefficient is one of the measures quantitatively relating the individual exhaust hydrocarbon to the gasoline composition. The production coefficients of benzene were 5% for toluene, 4% for xylene and 8% for ethylbenzene. These values suggested that alkylbenzene in the fuel produced benzene in the exhaust. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air quality; Benzene; Binary mixtures; Cracks; Engine cylinders; Ethylbenzene; Fluid catalytic cracking; Ionization of gases; Olefins; Paraffins; Regression analysis; Toluene; Xylene; Automobile exhaust; Flame ionization detectors; Gas chromatographs; Gasoline compositions; Hydrocarbon species; Impact on the environment; Single-cylinder research engines; Steady-state condition; Gasoline",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072417708

With Mg2+ as the divalent metal ion activator, primary deuterium and tritium isotope effects have been obtained with several different alternative dinucleotide substrates. The partitioning ratio of oxalacetate to malate and pyruvate has also been determined with either NAD or 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (3-APAD). These data have been used to calculate estimates of commitment factors and intrinsic isotope effects for the NAD-malic enzyme reaction. The calculated values of the intrinsic 13C and deuterium isotope effects with NADP are similar to the previously determined values for the chicken liver malic enzyme (Grissom, C. B., &amp; Cleland, W. W. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 2927) and suggest that the transition-state structures are similar for the Ascaris NAD -and chicken liver NADP-malic enzymes. With NAD or NADP as the dinucleotide substrate, the data are all consistent with a stepwise chemical mechanism with oxidation of l-malate at C2 preceding decarboxylation of the bound oxalacetate intermediate. However, none of the data with the alternative dinucleotide substrates, 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide and 3-pyridine aldehyde adenine dinucleotide (PAAD), can be fit with satisfaction to the various criteria that support a stepwise mechanism with NAD(P).

The results of our recent efforts to mitigate these environmental costs are perceptible, but still modest and very costly. Despite the use of sulfur scrubbers, acid rain remains a serious regional threat, especially with the increased use of lowquality coals. Catalytic converters have reduced nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions from automobiles in some countries, but the poor air quality of many of the world's urban areas nonetheless constitutes a severe health threat. New, more efficient power plants and automobiles generate less carbon dioxide per unit of useful energy than did their predecessors, but atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations continue to rise, intensifying the threat of global warming. Despite our diligent efforts, a major strategic shift in energy production may be required to achieve more than incremental and perhaps inadequate advances. What is needed is an energy conversion technology that is inherently clean, efficient and compatible with renewable energy sources.What the world needs now is an environmentally benign way to generate electric power efficiently.

The wave normal directions of the latter type of emissions were estimated by using the wave distribution function method. It is found that the emissions are propagating with their wave normal direction nearly perpendicular to the meridian plane. The propagation characteristics of these emissions are also examined by ray tracing including the effects of ions. The ray tracing study clarified that the wave can propagate around the plasmapause because of the trapping effect of density gradient.

We find halo H2 emission in NGC 6720 (the Ring Nebula), in Ring-like NGC 6772 and 6781, and in bipolar NGC 2346. In general, H2 halos precisely outline optical halos, but H2 core-to-halo surface brightness ratios are much smaller than those of their optical counterparts. Shock excitation appears to be a more likely mechanism than UV excitation for producing H2 halos in these evolved PNs. Geometric considerations then suggest that these PNs are all bipolar in structure and viewed at a range of inclination angles from nearly perpendicular to nearly pole-on. We also present images of NGC 7027 in H2, He I, and Brγ that vividly demonstrate the spatial separation of molecular and ionized emission previously established for this PN. The detached and morphologically dissimilar H2 and ionized emitting regions support the UV fluorescence model for this young PN.","Infrared: ISM: lines and bands; ISM: molecules; Planetary nebulae: general; Planetary nebulae: individual (NGC 6720, NGC 7027)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044256602

It is found that the linewidth of Fe Kα1 (K-L3) does not follow Van Vleck's theorem for oxides, but it follows Van Vleck's theorem for cyanides; the line shapes of FeO, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4 are nearly identical. These results are rationalized by the spin-unrestricted DV-Xα molecular-orbital calculations of model clusters. The model clusters we tried are [FeO6]10-, [FeO6]9-, [Fe(CN)6]3-, and [Fe(CN)6]4- as model clusters of FeO, Fe2O3, K3[Fe(CN)6]3H2O, and K4[Fe(CN)6], respectively. The electronic structures of these clusters are calculated for their ground states and 1s-1 hole states. It is concluded from these calculations that the charge-transfer effect induced by the creation of the 1s-1 core hole, which is the initial state of the Kα x-ray emission, reduces the effective number of 3d unpaired electrons of iron oxides, resulting in the Kα1 width being reduced from that expected from Van Vleck's theorem. On the other hand, the effective number of 3d unpaired electrons of cyanides in the ground state is conserved in the 1s-1 core-hole state. Thus Van Vleck's theorem holds for cyanides. © 1994 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001752182

In order to assess the emission mechanism, the transient luminescence decay was measured at various emission energies. At the high energy tail (2.883 eV), the luminescence showed exponential decay with a time constant of about 72 ps.

The velocity distributions of these light gases are perturbed in complex ways by atmospheric escape processes, by the paucity of thermalizing collisions, and by infrequent but important collisions with hot ions in the plasmasphere. It has long been recognized that the velocity distributions can be used to unfold the physical processes leading to atmospheric escape and to the partitioning of neutral gas trajectory classifications (ballistic, escaping, or satellite). Unfortunately, isolation of the velocity distribution from the measured emission line profile is not a simple matter, especially when neither of the velocity distributions are non- Maxwellian and when the instrument function used to measure the profile is also a complex function. We have experimented with several techniques to accurately retrieve the velocity distribution of atomic hydrogen in the earth's exosphere from the hydrogen Balmer-alpha (Hα) emission line profile measured with a Fabry-Perot interferometer. Although the derived velocity distribution remains subject to contamination of the measured emission by extraterrestrial and terrestrial sources, the technique to decompose the actual emission function from the combined instrument function plus emission function is established in this work - and is applicable to many other similar problems. In particular, two techniques are compared. First, a classical deconvolution technique is developed using objective, low-pass filtering. Second, a nonlinear deconvolution algorithm, commonly referred to as `CLEAN' by the radio astronomy community that developed it, is applied to the optical Hα spectra. We find that this second technique is useful for an accurate isolation of the velocity distribution of atomic hydrogen in earth's exosphere, while the classical deconvolution is more useful for determining the full width at half maximum of the emission. The CLEAN technique does a superior job of isolating low signal-to-noise information in the emission profile wings, of particular interest for the derivation of the escaping atomic hydrogen population. It is particularly important that the CLEAN technique, when properly applied, is not susceptible to the addition of unrealistic information in the low signal-to-noise region of emission line extrema, whereas common deconvolution techniques are often quite suspect in these regions. Using this new technique and a new ability to ascribe hydrogen column abundance to Hα brightness measurements, we are now poised to derive atomic hydrogen escape fluxes without dependence upon models of escape flux dynamics.",,"Atmospheric composition; Atoms; Emission spectroscopy; Fabry-Perot interferometers; Hydrogen; Signal to noise ratio; Upper atmosphere; Velocity measurement; Deconvolution; Atmospheric spectra",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028757390

Cyclones without an inverted trough tend to occur when the synoptic-scale ascent region moves rapidly eastward away from the mountains, so that surface pressure falls immediately to the east of the mountains with attendent cold-air damming cannot be sustained.

There has been, however, difficulity in expanding the compatibility region, where both the extension of LML(Lean Misfire Limit) and the reduction of NOx are simultaneously achieved while keeping satisfactory drivability. The lean misfire limit has been extended by the introduction of swirl and tumble motion. Three types of ports with an IACV(Intake Air Control Valve) have been developed to satisfy seemingly contradictory requirements of obtaining sufficient swirl and tumble motion to improve combustion and still keep high volumetric efficiency. Effects of newly designed ports with IACV on LML, emissions(NOx, THC, CO), BSFC, MBT, were confirmed in a four cylinder engine. Tests showed that the combustion duration was shortened and consequently lean misfire limit and EGR tolerance were improved. Emission level of NOx is considerably reduced. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air intakes; Combustion; Fuel economy; Nitrogen oxides; Combustion duration; Emission level; Four cylinder engine; Lean burn engine technologies; Lean-burn engines; Reducing emissions; Swirl and tumble motions; Volumetric efficiency; Engine cylinders",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072433196

Members of each of these homologous series can be represented by their dualist graphs which have vertices in the centers of each triangle in the case of rafts and bow ties, and vertices in the centers of each tetrahedron in the case of chains of tetrahedra, with pairs of vertices connected by an edge if the corresponding triangles share edges or vertices or if the corresponding tetrahedra share faces, respectively.

The study showed xenon to be comparable to carbon dioxide in terms of resulting chromatography for non‐polar analytes. Xenon was confirmed to be a very poor mobile phase, however, for polar analytes. It was determined that small wavenumber shifts in the infrared spectra of probe analytes occurred as either the density or temperature of the mobile phase was increased. The degree of these shifts was often similar for xenon and carbon dioxide. Analyte spectra for five different compounds were produced in both super critical xenon and carbon dioxide and compared to condensed phase and vapor phase library spectra. In all cases, carbon dioxide spectra were readily matched to their corresponding vapor phase spectra, despite having blanked portions of the spectrum due to carbon dioxide infrared absorption. Xenon produced technically superior spectra without such blanked regions, but at a much higher economical cost than carbon dioxide and with no real improvement in terms of library matching.

The twin objectives are to assess the manner and degree to which the former ""uhv electrochemical modeling"" tactic mimics the vibrational spectral properties of the latter interface, and to exploit the additional molecular structural information obtainable for the former surface configuration in elucidating solvation effects for the in situ electrochemical system. Postdosing water onto CO adlayers in uhv yields progressive attenuation of the C-O stretching (νCO) IRAS bands associated with atop and twofold bridging coordination on the clean Pt(111) surface, being replaced by bands at lower frequencies that are more characteristic of the CO coverage (θCO)-dependent νCO features observed for the electrochemical interface. This ""titration- likeæ spectral response, indicating that the added water assembles into hydrogen-bound islands which are nonetheless microscopically intermixed with the contiguous CO adlayer regions, is typically complete by water coverages corresponding to about 2-3 ""equivalent bilayers."" Water dosage-dependent spectra in the O-D stretching (νOD) region for zero or low predosed CO coverages display the hallmarks of markedly increased hydrogen bonding beyond the bilayer point, whereas such hydrogen bonding is prevalent even at submonolayer water dosages for intermediate or near-saturated θCO values. The work-function decreases, -ΔΦ, induced by water dosing also are indicative of synergistic water/CO interactions, larger -ΔΦ values being obtained in the presence of low or intermediate predosed CO coverages than in its absence. A distinction is drawn between ""specific"" and ""nonspecific"" water co-dosing effects upon the CO adlayer structure; the former involves adjacent CO/D2O coadsorbate interactions, while the latter is describable most simply by the changes in the surface potential. The θCO-dependent CO site occupancies and νCO frequencies for the hydrated uhv and electrochemical Pt(111) systems are found to be in close concordance, the latter when the interfaces are compared at equivalent values of the surface potential.

This system is built around an 8-m3 photochemical chamber constructed of Teflon film. The chamber has been designed to be portable and allow both indoor and outdoor irradiations. The indoor irradiation system uses a combination of ultraviolet fluorescent bulbs to match, to the extent possible, solar radiation. Exhaust from the test vehicles is generated in an adjoining dynamometer facility. Exhaust can be added directly to the chamber from the dilution tunnel or collected in intermediate Teflon bags and then added to the chamber. For vehicles having relatively low emissions the second approach is required. Instrumentation associated with the chamber system includes continuous monitors for measuring NOx and ozone, hydrocarbons from both reactant and product mixtures, peroxyacyl nitrates, and carbonyl compounds. Irradiations were conducted on 10 vehicle-fuel combinations. The fuels include reformulated and other alternative fuels. Emissions were collected during Bag 1 of the Federal Test Procedure to ensure sufficient exhaust hydrocarbon during the irradiation. Similar initial conditions were set for each vehicle-fuel combination to allow evaluation (to the extent possible) of differences in reactivity of the exhaust mixture. Reactivity parameters, such as the rate of NO oxidation and the rate of ozone formation, were examined for irradiations of the exhaust mixtures. Formation of toxic species (peroxyacyl nitrates and carbonyls) was also determined during the study. This paper describes the motivation for the experiments, details on the experimental design, and the data from irradiations of the exhaust of three fuels using a single vehicle. The reduction in air pollution resulting from the advances in motor vehicle emission control technology of the 1980s and 1990s is being offset by increased numbers of vehicles on the nation's roadways (growth in vehicle miles traveled), and by a persistence of malfunctioning vehicles. As a consequence, the U.S. Congress, in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments [1], has required further reduction of emissions from new motor vehicles, introduction of environmentally favorable reformulations of conventional diesel and gasoline fuels, and introduction of alternative fuels such as methanol, ethanol, and natural gas with associated vehicle technologies. Gasoline reformulation must result in reduction of both ozone-forming volatile organic compound (VOC) and toxic compound (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, polycyclic organic matter, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene) emissions. The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (AMFA) also mandated the introduction of alternatives to conventional vehicle and fuel technologies. This legislation and the considerable difficulty in meeting the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone and CO in metropolitan areas have resulted in initiatives to develop reformulated and alternative fuels. With historical phase-out of leaded gasoline additives, aromatic hydrocarbon levels have increased to maintain necessary fuel octane. However, aromatic compounds can be important ozone precursors and contribute to elevated benzene emissions. Part of the developing strategy to maintain octane while removing aromatic compounds has been the introduction of alcohols and aliphatic ethers into gasoline blends. For example, methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethanol are being used in many areas in the country as additives in winter grade gasolines for CO emissions reduction. Oxygenates will also be used in summer gasolines in areas requiring reformulated gasoline for ozone abatement. In addition to changes and improvements in fuels, considerable efforts are being made by automotive companies to produce vehicles that generate lower levels of exhaust and evaporative emissions. New technology vehicles are also being developed to use alternatives to conventional fuels. The federal government, through AMFA, is leading in the purchase of vehicles that operate on methanol, ethanol, and compressed natural gas (CNG). This effort is expected to demonstrate feasibility for introduction of large numbers of these vehicles into the general population over the next dozen years. As new fuels and vehicle technologies are introduced and ultimately become predominant, the distribution of compounds introduced into the atmosphere, particular the urban atmosphere, will change considerably. Thus, the potential air quality effects of vehicle exhaust and evaporative emissions resulting from use of these fuels and their photodegradation products must be assessed. This information is vital for determining tropospheric lifetimes, effects on ozone formation, and possible generation of toxic and genotoxic products in the atmosphere. In response to these needs, a multitude of changes in vehicle design, fuel composition, and emission control technology are being investigated by the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, automotive manufacturers, and petroleum producers. The formation of ozone and other toxic compounds from photochemical transformations of automotive exhaust are frequently studied in laboratory smog chambers. Frequently, surrogate mixtures are used to represent automotive exhaust and/or evaporative emissions. This approach allows reproducible mixtures to be produced in the chamber to examine the effect of individual compounds or other physical variables. However, this approach makes it difficult, if not impossible, to experimentally compare the reactivity and toxics formation of the whole exhaust and evaporative emissions mixtures associated with the use various fuels. The experimental program described in this paper has been designed to test reactivity parameters by experimental means. In the first phase of this program, the reactivity of emissions from a series of vehicles utilizing different types of alternative fuels is examined. The use of this approach has required substantial methods development in both the design of the experimental system and the procedures for carrying out the experiments. A dynamometer/photochemistry chamber system has been developed to examine the reactivity of exhaust from vehicles operating on alternative fuels. Exhaust from test vehicles is generated for injection into a smog chamber by using dynamometer simulations of roadway driving conditions. The exhaust is irradiated, most of the major organic and inorganic constituents are measured, and several reactivity parameters are determined. Preliminary data from a subset of the runs conducted are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the experimental system. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Acetaldehyde; Air quality; Air quality standards; Aromatization; Automobile manufacture; Automotive fuels; Benzene; Compressed natural gas; Design of experiments; Dynamometers; Emission control; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental technology; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Ethers; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Irradiation; Laws and legislation; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Mixtures; Natural gas vehicles; Nitrates; Ozone; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Purchasing; Radiation; Software testing; Testing; Volatile organic compounds; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Emission control technologies; Methyl tertiary butyl ether; National ambient air quality standards; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Photochemical transformations; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Alternative fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072439087

Specifically, the enzyme catalyzes the first reaction in the pathway leading to the production of pentose phosphates and reducing power in the form of NADPH for reductive biosynthesis and maintenance of the redox state of the cell. It was in this latter function that the crucial importance of the enzyme was first appreciated with the description of the human deficiency syndrome. While the gene can be considered to be a constitutively expressed 'housekeeping' gene in many tissues, there are several other tissues (liver, adipose, lung, and proliferating cells) wherein modulation of cellular G6PDH activity represents an important component of the integrated response to external stimuli (hormones, growth factors, nutrients, and oxidant stress). In this regard, adaptive regulation of G6PDH has been found to be exerted at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. However, the regulation observed is tissue- specific, which elicits the central question of this review, 'How can the G6PDH gene be constitutively expressed in some tissues while displaying adaptive regulation in others when there exists a single transcription unit for the gene?' Future studies utilizing cloned genomic fragments of the human and other mammalian G6PDH genes should provide answers to this question.","adaptive regulation; gene structure; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; oxidant stress","glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase; antigen expression; enzyme activity; enzyme regulation; gene control; gene structure; hormonal regulation; nonhuman; nutrient; osmotic stress; oxidation reduction reaction; pentose phosphate cycle; priority journal; protein processing; review; tissue specificity; Mammalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028176627

It contains also information for the structural peculiarities of YBa2Cu3O7-x superconductors and data for oxygen reactivity from temperature-programmed reduction, oxygen isotopic exchange and oxygen desorption measurements. A distinct correlation between the superconductivity of YBa2Cu3O7-x and its catalytic activity in ortho-para hydrogen conversion is observed. Data in the literature show an influence of the oxygen vacancies concentration in these solids and their activity and selectivity. However, in many cases no relationship seems to exist between the superconducting properties and the catalytic activity and selectivity. This is explained by: (i) the experiments were performed at temperatures much higher than Tc and (ii) significant surface and bulk alterations in high-Tc super-conductors during the catalytic reactions, as concluded from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction data (appearance of Cu+ and Cu0 states in the surface layers, orthorhombic/tetragonal phase transition, and, in some cases, decomposition and phase segregation). The outstanding importance of oxygen binding energy for complete oxidation reactions is already shown. From the practical point of view, the high activities and selectivities should be noted of high-Tc superconductors in selective oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes, in nitric oxide reduction by carbon monoxide and in ammoxidation of toluene to benzonitrile. Special attention should be paid to some related non-superconducting cuprates, which show high performances for complete oxidation reactions, with specific catalytic activities commensurable to those of the best catalysts known until now (e.g., Pt, Co3O4). Some possible future studies on the catalytic properties of high-Tc superconductors and related cuprates are outlined. © 1994.","ammonia oxidation; barium; carbon monoxide oxidation; copper; iso-propanol dehydrogenation; methane oxidation; methanol dehydrogenation; nitric oxide decomposition; ortho-para conversion; perovskite-type; superconductivity; toluene oxidation; yttrium","Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Copper oxides; Decomposition; Desorption; Oxidation; Phase transitions; Reduction; Superconductivity; Thermal effects; X ray spectroscopy; Aliphatic alcohols; Cuprates; Ortho-para hydrogen conversion; Oxygen desorption measurement; Oxygen isotopic exchange; Selective oxidation; Temperature programmed reduction; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; High temperature superconductors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028378219

Excitation with a focused pump beam reduced the lasing threshold. The effect was strongest when the Q factor of the resonator cavity was low. This reduction in the lasing threshold by focusing the pump laser beam was attributed to an increase in the rate of spontaneous emission resulting from lasing of desqueezed states (enhancement of ‘zero-field’ fluctuations responsible for the appearance of spontaneous emission). An increase in the spontaneous emission rate reduced the buildup time of stimulated emission during the early stages and thus reduced the lasing threshold. © 1994 Kvantovaya Elektronika and Turpion Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039845828

Within chambers or in adjacent unchambered plots, the dominant C4 grass, Andropogon gerardii, was subjected to fluctuations in sunlight similar to that produced by clouds or within canopy shading (full sun &gt; 1500 μmol m−2 s−1 versus 350 μmol m−2 s−1 shade) and responses in gas exchange were measured. These field experiments demonstrated that stomatal conductance in A. gerardii achieved new steady state levels more rapidly after abrupt changes in sunlight at elevated CO2 when compared to plants at ambient CO2. This was due primarily to the 50% reduction in stomatal conductance at elevated CO2, but was also a result of more rapid stomatal responses. Time constants describing stomatal responses were significantly reduced (29–33%) at elevated CO2. As a result, water loss was decreased by as much as 57% (6.5% due to more rapid stomatal responses). Concurrent increases in leaf xylem pressure potential during periods of sunlight variability provided additional evidence that more rapid stomatal responses at elevated CO2 enhanced plant water status. CO2‐induced alterations in the kinetics of stomatal responses to variable sunlight will likely enhance direct effects of elevated CO2 on plant water relations in all ecosystems.

A geothermic ""lime-kiln"" has provided these communities, for as long as historical records are available, with pure CO2 that mixes with ambient air at canopy level to daytime means of 500-1000 ppm CO2. Immediately outside the spring area similar plant communities are growing on similar substrate, and in the same climate, but under ca. 355 ppm CO2. We found no evidence that plants in the CO2 spring area grow faster, flower earlier or become larger. However, we found very large differences in tissue quality among the 40 species studied inside and outside the spring area. Depending on weather conditions, the mean concentration of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC, sugars and starch) in leaves of herbaceous plants was 38-47% higher in the spring area. Fast growing ruderals growing on garden soil inside and outside the spring area show the same response. Among trees, leaves of the deciduous Quercus pubscens contain twice as much TNC inside as outside the vent area, whereas evergreen Q. ilex leaves show no significant difference. TNC levels in branch wood paralleled leaf values. TNC in shade leaves was also higher. Elevated CO2 had no effect on the sugar fraction, therefore differences in TNC are due to starch accumulation. Leaf nitrogen concentration decreases under elevated CO2. These observations suggest that the commonly reported TNC accumulation and N depletion in leaves growing under elevated CO2 are not restricted to the artificial conditions of short-term CO2 enrichment experiments but persist over very long periods. Such an alteration of tissue composition can be expected to occur in other plant communities also if atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise.

It considers the various physical and chemical phenomena associated with the ignition process and employs a detailed chemical reaction scheme for a methane-air mixture which contains 29 chemical species and 97 reaction steps. The thermodynamics and transport properties of the plasma at high temperatures are evaluated by a statistical thermodynamics approach, while assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium. Using the PHOENICS and the CHEMKIN codes, the appropriate conservation equations are solved in the domain of solution. It was concluded that the kernel growth can be described as a two-step process. In the early short stage (1-5 μs) the mass and energy transfer processes are very much dominated by the pressure wave and the violently expanding plasma kernel, while the contribution of the chemical reactions is negligible. This stage is followed by a much longer period in which diffusion and thermal conduction control mass and energy transfer as the flame becomes gradually self-sustained. Owing to the heat release by chemical reactions, the expansion of the combustible mixture is accelerated at the beginning of the diffusive stage. © 1994.",,"Chemical reactions; Heat transfer; High temperature effects; Ignition; Internal combustion engines; Mathematical models; Statistical mechanics; Thermal conductivity; Thermodynamics; Axial symmetry; Coordinate systems; Thermal conduction control; Flame research; methane; air; chemical reaction; combustion; conference paper; energy transfer; fire; gas diffusion; gas flow; gas mixing; high temperature; pressure; priority journal; stoichiometry; thermodynamics; velocity; Combustion; Modelling-Mathematical; Sparks/Flames",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028670332

Many factors, in addition to the risk for human health, play a role in the process of decision-making concerning control measures. Often the impact of a human health risk assessment on the final decision is hard to estimate. However, some examples can be given from Dutch experiences in which health risk considerations did play a major role and were translated in clear action or, in contrast, in very limited action (e.g., the emission of dioxin by municipal waste incinerators; smog episodes).

R. Grace and Co.","Kubsh, J.E., W. R. Grace and Co.","EHC heating patterns which utilize zones covering less than the available inlet face cross-sectional area have been evaluated for cold-start FTP performance. Both NMHC and CO cold-start emission performance were found to be significantly reduced relative to an EHC-inactive basecase for heating patterns that covered as little as 44% of the cross-section. In low-mileage tests, NMHC and CO cold-start emission dependencies on heating patterns were found to be relatively constant for patterns with heating coverages of 44% or more of the inlet face cross-sectional area. In these low mileage tests, reductions in Bag 1 FTP NMHC and CO emissions averaged about 30% lower with the preferred zoned heating patterns relative to the EHC-inactive basecase. FTP tests run on a similar engine-aged EHC showed less asymptotic dependence on EHC zoned heating strategies. Improvements in cold-start NMHC and CO performance were observed for heating patterns as zoned heating coverages increased from 44% to 89% of the available inlet cross-sectional area. Electrically heated catalytic converter (EHC) technology received attention in the late 1980s in response to initiatives by the EPA and CARB aimed at reducing cold-start vehicle emissions. First generation EHC prototypes demonstrated significant reductions in cold-start hydrocarbon and CO emissions in low-mileage FTP evaluations, but were characterized by large power demands of 5 kW or more (1, 2 and 3). More recently EHC electrical energy demands have been significantly reduced by reductions in EHC mass (4, 5 and 6). These low-mass EHCs have also been combined with small volume, unheated metal or ceramic-based converter functions in either cascade or fully integrated single-core designs to provide additional cold-start emission reduction benefits (5, 6, 7, 8 and 9). Low-power EHC designs have allowed for substantial simplification of EHC system characteristics (and in-turn system costs) including operation with a single battery or direct connection to a vehicle alternator (6, 9, 10). Cascade arrangements that combine heated and unheated core functions take advantage the ""ignitor"" characteristics of the EHC. In this scheme the EHC quickly reaches catalytically active temperatures and serves to initiate the oxidation reactions in the exhaust stream shortly after engine start. The combustion energy released from these oxidation reactions is then efficiently transferred to the unheated core function in order to accelerate its warm-up. This cascade arrangement quickly provides for sufficient active catalyst area to cope with the initial high exhaust flows encountered during the first acceleration of the FTP driving cycle. In a recent paper authored by Toyota (11), this EHC ignitor function was taken one step further by considering designs in which only portions of the EHC cross-section were electrically heated. Reductions in EHC energy demand were realized with this approach while still maintaining high cold-start emission reduction efficiencies. Here again the success of this concept relied on the initiation of combustion reactions within the heated zones of the EHC and the transfer of the combustion energy to both unheated regions of the EHC and a downstream, unheated light-off converter. In the work presented here, a closer look is given to the concept of partial cross-sectional heating of the EHC as a means of reducing EHC energy demands. A specially designed EHC prototype that includes provisions for electrically heating various extents of the EHC cross-section has been evaluated in both low-mileage and simulated high-mileage conditions using the FTP driving cycle. The impact of various ""zoned"" EHC heating patterns on cold-start emission performance is presented and discussed below. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Catalytic converters; Combustion; Emission control; Asymptotic dependence; Combustion reactions; Cross sectional area; Electrical energy demand; Emission performance; Emissions performance; Oxidation reactions; System characteristics; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072446599

It performs the oxidation of CO to CO2, the reduction of CO2 to CO, and the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from a methylated corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein, CO, and CoA. These reactions occur at metal centers on CODH and involve metal-carbon bond formation and transformation. There are three iron-containing centers that play distinct roles in CODH: Centers A, B, and C. Center A is the site of synthesis of acetyl-CoA and catalyzes an exchange reaction between CO and acetyl-CoA. Center C is the site of CO oxidation and CO2 reduction. In the work described here, inhibition of CODH by carbon disulfide was studied. CS2 was found to serve as a probe of the interaction of CODH with CO at Center A. EPR spectroscopic and steady-state kinetic studies demonstrated that CS2 mimics the binding of CO to the nickel/iron-sulfur cluster at Center A; however, CS2 itself does not undergo oxidation-reduction and does not appear to bind to Center C as does CO. In the isotope exchange reaction between acetyl-CoA and CO, CS2 was found to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to CO (Ki = 0.47 mM) and a mixed inhibitor with respect to acetyl-CoA (Ai1 = 0.30 and Ki2= 1.1 mM). The reaction of dithionite-reduced CODH with CS2 resulted in an EPR spectrum with g values of 2.200,2.087, and 2.017. This EPR signal from the CS2 adduct with Center A is similar to that assigned to the Ni(I) state of hydrogenases. EPR spectroelectrochemical titrations demonstrated that the CODH-CS2 complex has three redox states and that the intermediate state is paramagnetic. A maximum of 0.3–0.4 spins/mol of CODH could be obtained. Fitting this data to the Nernst equation indicated that integral spin intensities could not be obtained because the reduction potentials for the two redox couples were the same (∼-455 mV). We suggest that similar redox chemistry may limit the spin intensity of the adduct between Center A and CO. Although CS2 did not bind to Center C, it inhibited reactions that occur at Center C. CS2 was a noncompetitive inhibitor vs CO2 in CO2 reduction and vs CO in CO oxidation. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

We assume that a fraction f of gravitational energy is dissipated in a corona, and the remaining fraction, 1 - f, within a disk. The disk is heated not only by viscous processes (the α-model) but also by the irradiation from the corona. Cooling of the corona is due to bremsstrahlung and Comptonization of soft photons supplied by the disk. We find two distinct branches of steady state solutions for a given luminosity, depending on the main cooling source in the corona; one is bremsstrahlung-dominated (the b-branch), and the other is Comptonized-soft-photon dominated (the s-branch). The emission spectrum from the s-branch obeys a power law, while the emission from the b-branch is the superposition of bremsstrahlung from the corona and a blackbody from the disk. The s-branch was previously obtained by Haardt &amp; Maraschi, but the newly found b-branch affects the whole structure of the solution. The structure of a disk-corona system is very sensitive to a parameter ζ = (1 - f)/α and the dissipation rate Qg of gravitational energy in a unit area. When we fix the radial distance from the central black hole, R, two solutions exist for any of Qg only if ζ is smaller than a critical value, ζcr (≪ 1). When ζ &gt; ζcr, in contrast, there is a range of Qg where no steady state solution exists, because the cooling rate exceeds the heating rate. On the other hand, when the mass accretion of a disk, Ṁd, is given, there is an annular region where no steady state solution exists when ζ &lt; ζRcr. Here the critical value ζRcr ( ≪ 1) depends on Ṁd.","Accretion, accretion disks; Black hole physics; Galaxies: active; Galaxies: nuclei; Radiation mechanisms: nonthermal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044253297

In the present study, the interactions of the four major types of odorants emitted by treatment plants worldwide, namely, hydrogen sulphide, isovaleric acid, butanethiol, and skatole, were investigated by measuring the perceived intensity of individual odorants alone and in mixtures, and the overall perceived intensity, unpleasantness, and qualities of mixtures. In addition, models for predicting odor strength were investigated. The results indicated that (i) the perceived odor intensity (odor strength) of mixtures of the odorants was equal or greater than that of any of the individual constituents, but less than the sum of their intensities. However, as the number of components in a mixture increased, the intensity of the most dominant component provided a good approximation of the intensity of the mixture. (ii) The vector model of intensity summation also satisfactorily predicted the odor intensity of mixtures containing two, three, or four of the odorants investigated. (iii) In no instance was the intensity of one odorant enhanced by another, i.e., no synergistic interactions occurred; the greater the number of odorants in a mixture, the greater was the degree of suppression of the individual constituents. (iv) The greater the number of constituents in a mixture the more difficult it became to identify individual constituents. (v) Hydrogen sulphide was the least frequently suppressed constituent, and isovaleric acid and skatole were the most frequently suppressed constituents in mixtures. (vi) The unpleasantness of mixtures was usually greater than that of the individual constituents, indicating that models used for predicting complaint levels in communities affected by sewage odor and based on assumptions related to a single odorant, e.g., hydrogen sulphide, will underestimate the number of complaints. Even mixtures with low but above threshold concentrations of these odorants are likely to generate complaints. © 1994.","Hydrogen sulphide; Isovaleric acid; Odor mixtures; Odorants; Sewage odor; Skatole","butanethiol; hydrogen sulfide; isovaleric acid; skatole; unclassified drug; adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; olfactory discrimination; perception; priority journal; sewage effluent; smelling; Adult; Air Pollutants; Attention; Butanes; Discrimination Learning; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Human; Hydrogen Sulfide; Male; Middle Age; Odors; Pentanoic Acids; Sensory Thresholds; Sewage; Skatole; Smell; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028303686

The nature and extent of winter damage on grasslands is highly dependent on climatic conditions, and determines both persistency and yield. Physical stresses such as frost and ice encasement predominate in coastal regions with an unstable winter climate, while biotic stresses such as low temperature fungi are more common in the inland regions. Development of hardening depends on plant adaptation and climatic conditions during autumn and winter. New winter-hardy cultivars should be bred for wide adaptation to winter stresses. The genetic background for the most important character, freezing tolerance, seems to be of polygenic nature with mainly additive gene action. Selection for increased freezing tolerance has been effective over generations in grasses, and in most grass species ample variation still exists to be exploited by breeding. However, in some species like perennial ryegrass, modern biotechnological methods should be used to improve freezing tolerance and winter hardiness. © 1974 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","breeding; freezing tolerance; Grasses; hardening; ice encasement; snow moulds; winter hardiness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004202188

The intersection of CCO with WM is between 1050° and 1150°C and thus the log f{hook}O2 of CCO at 1100°C is constrained to be -5.10 ± 0.59. From 1100° to 1550°C CCO is between NNO and WM, and below 1100°C CCO is more oxidized than both NNO and WM. Although the intersection of CCO and NNO was not located, previous studies indicate that CCO has shallower slope than NNO and with this constraint the log f{hook}O2 of CCO at 1550°C is -1.76 ± 0.95. The f{hook}O2 of CCO at 8 GPa and 950-1550°C can be expressed as log f{hook}O2 = 8.4 ± 0.8 - 18570 ± 7000/T (°K) and is consistent with other recent experiments. The results of this study define the f{hook}O2 of experiments conducted in graphite capsules and regions of the mantle saturated with diamond and a CO fluid. CCO is more oxidizing than diamond-carbonate buffers and thus the existence of CO2-rich fluids in natural samples at ∼ 8 GPa probably requires an olivine-free local environment such as eclogite. CCO lies in the reduced half of the range of estimated mantle f{hook}O2 values and thus diamond will be stable only in the more reduced regions. CO2 fugacities estimated from these results are at the low end of the range predicted by equations of state at low temperature but show a greater thermal expansion for CO2 and, hence, a greater increase in f{hook}CO2 with temperature than the equations of state. This results in lower predicted decarbonation reaction temperatures near 8 GPa compared to existing equations of state. © 1994.",,"carbon dioxide fugacity; diamond; mantle; oxygen fugacity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028555625

Experiments are performed in 1-D conditions on a chalk core saturated with a methane-pentane mixture in presence of different water saturation levels and with two diffusing gases: nitrogen and methane. It has been found out that: Similarly to previous experiments performed without interstitial water, saturation profiles reveal a strong capillary end effect for nitrogen injection with an accumulation of oil near the fracture. The impact of water saturation on recovery depends strongly on the nature of the diffusing gas. In case of methane injection along the fracture, the faster the oil withdrawal at the fracture, the higher the water saturation level. In case of a nitrogen injection, the methane production is proportional to the hydrocarbon mass initially in place whereas pentane production remains unchanged. In addition to that, in case of nitrogen injection, the variations of the differential pressure are pointing out discontinuity in the gas phase occurring between the fracture and the bulk of the porous medium.

They are usually, but incorrectly, described as 'saprophytes’since they are in fact nourished by means of specialized mycorrhizal associations. Although distributed world‐wide, they are most abundant and show the greatest species‐richness in the Neotropics and Palaeotropical regions. Their aerial parts range in size from a few centimetres to extensive liane types up to 40 m long. With few exceptions, their habitats are dense moist forests in which there is a surface accumulation of leaf litter, often in situations which are too shaded for autotrophic growth. Although the achlorophyllous mycorrhizal mode of life has evolved independently many times and in widely disparate taxonomic groups, such plants show strong convergent evolution in particular adaptations to their peculiar mode of life. Most prominant amongst these are reductions in the size of seed and embryo, and the lack of differentiation of the embryo at maturity. The number of seeds produced by each flower is typically very large and the shape, structure and surface features of seeds involving adaptation for wind dispersal show remarkable parallels in many species. Specific adaptations for zoochory are rare but well developed in a small number of genera, some of which produce scents like fungal fruit bodies or floral parts which mimic fungal sporocarps. Vegetative parts are often even more conspicuously reduced. Most myco‐heterotrophs are entirely subterranean for most of their lives and these stages exhibit adaptations consistent with a change in function from organs of absorption to organs of storage, shown by the almost universal loss of root hairs, decrease in surface area as exhibited in short cylindric‘vermiform’and tuberous roots or, in extreme cases, the complete suppression of roots and the formation of a swollen tuber or rhizome. Increased width of the root cortex often accommodates mycorrhizal infection and stores of carbohydrates and other materials obtained from the fungal symbiont. Mycorrhizal infection is confined to the below‐ground parts of the plants but may be found there in modified stems as well as in roots. In many genera, stems are exceptionally slender and thread‐like and their vascular tissues are either reduced to a single narrow cylinder of bicollateral bundles or, minimally, to four or six narrow bundles in the cortex. Secondary thickening is poorly developed in all but a tiny minority of species, lignification being confined to annular or, rarely, a few scalariform xylem vessels. Phloem is present in very small amounts and then mainly as parenchyma with sieve tubes frequently recorded as narrow and possibly with abherent sieve plates. Leaves are typically reduced to widely spaced achlorophyllous scales on the inflorescence axis. Occasionally, they are present only on underground rhizomes or tubers. The vascular supply to the leaf‐scales, normally reduced to a single trace, may be absent. Vestigial stomata are sometimes found on leaves and, in a few species which retain traces of chlorophyll, on shoots but, in most fully heterotrophic species, stomata are absent from aerial parts. Since their seeds are very small and contain minimal reserve carbohydrates, the germination of myco‐heterotrophs in nature would appear to depend upon infection by an appropriate symbiotic fungus at an early stage. The nature of the carbohydrates transferred from the fungus to the plants has not been determined. Once acquired from The fungal partner, most plants store carbon in a variety of forms, the most common of which is starch, although other compounds including glucomannan, fructan and calcium oxalate art important in some specks. Asexual reproduction is frequently important with root tubers, tubercles and rhizomes providing the means of vegetative spread. Nonetheless, all the angiospermous species recorded to date also reproduce sexually. Floral structures show varying degrees of reduction concomitant with myco‐heterotrophy. Inflorescences are typically small, often with a single terminal flower, and the floral parts often show extreme simplification, with the production of unilocular or, more rarely, bilocular and trilocular ovaries. In some of the most highly adapted species, there is reduction of integumentary layers surrounding each ovule from the normal bitegmic condition to unitegmic or, occasionally, ategmic. With the principal exception of the Monotropaceae, placentation is typically trimerous and parietal. Flowers normally appear to be cross‐pollinated and are brightly coloured. nectiferous, occasionally scented, and can demonstrate extreme morphological adaptations which attract insects as in the production of lone caudate tepals or fungus‐mimicking structures. Much is still to be learned about the adaptive features and especially about the physiology of these plants and of their early developmental stages during which the essential associations with fungi are established. Similarly, studies of the taxonomy and physiology of most of their fungal partners are still in their infancy. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

In order to investigate the effects of muscular work and preceding exercise on the retention of exogenous labelled bicarbonate, we studied the effects of oral administration of [13C]bicarbonate (0·1 mg kg‐1) in five subjects at rest before exercise and during and after 1 h of treadmill walking at 73% VO2max on three separate occasions. Elimination of CO2 from labelled bicarbonate was 62·6±8·1% at rest, 103·6±11·3% during exercise (P&lt;0·01) and 43·0±4·7% during recovery from exercise (P= 0·01). During exercise mean residence time (MRT) was shorter than at rest (35±7 min vs. 54±9min, P &lt; 0·02) and CO2 pool size was larger (998±160 ml CO2kg‐1, vs. 194±28ml CO2kg‐1, P &lt; 0·001). Compared to values obtained at rest, during recovery from exercise, MRT and CO2 pool size were reduced (34±5min, P &lt; 0·05; 116±19 ml CO2kg‐1, P &lt; 0·02, respectively). In an additional five subjects acidosis and alkalosis were induced prior to administration of oral [13C]bicarbonate at rest. Elimination of bicarbonate was lower during acidosis (46·1±5·6%, P &lt; 0·01) but was unaltered (50·9±5·6%, NS) during alkalosis, compared to the values obtained at resting pH. During acidosis MRT and CO2 pool size decreased (37±3min, P&lt;0·01 and 123±10ml CO2kg‐1, P &lt; 0·01, respectively) whereas in alkalosis MRT was unchanged (65±8 min NS) but CO2 pool size was increased (230±23ml CO2kg‐1, P &lt; 0·05). The kinetics of elimination of 13CO2 from administered bicarbonate after exercise are different to those at rest and resemble acidosis. The appropriate correction factor for sequestered 13C should be used in metabolic studies of the post‐exercise state when using 13C tracers. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

The only site of insertion for tertbutyl isocyanide is the W-C bond, the W-N and W-O being unreactive toward this substrate. In contrast, the preferential site of insertion for the two heterocumulenes, p-tolyl isocyanate, and carbon disulfide, was found to be W–N &gt; W–O &gt; W–C and W–N ≅ W–C &gt; W–O, respectively. These observations can be rationalized in terms of two different mechanisms being operative, one involving initial adduct formation at the metal center and the other involving direct attack at the tungsten–element bond undergoing the insertion. The tert-butyl isocyanide reactions proceed predominantly via the former mechanism, the p-tolyl isocyanate reactions proceed predominantly via the latter mechanism, and the carbon disulfide reactions proceed via both mechanistic pathways simultaneously. Consistently, a kinetic investigation of the reaction between complex 2 and p-tolyl isocyanate reveals that the reaction is second-order overall and first-order in 2 in the presence of an excess of isocyanate, findings indicative of a simple bimolecular reaction between 2 and the isocyanate. The solid-state molecular structure of Cp*W(NO)(η2-C{NCMe3}CH2CMe3)(OCMe3) (5), formed by the reaction of 3 with tert-butyl isocyanide, has been established by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Crystals of 5 are orthorhombic, space group Pbca, with a = 17.459(2) Å, b = 20.393(3) Å, c = 15.075(3) Å, and Z = 8; the structure was solved by conventional heavy-atom methods and was refined by full-matrix least-squares procedures to RF = 0.032 and RwF = 0.027 for 3856 reflections with I ≥ 3σ (I). Finally, the reactivity of 1–3 and the related chloro complexes, Cp*W(NO) (XCMe3)Cl (X = NH, CH2 and O), with CO2 has also been investigated and indicates that, in general, the W–N linkage is the preferential site of CO2 insertion. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

Topsoil (0–20 cm) and subsoil (60–100 cm) properties are compared at agricultural and nearby natural vegetation sites in São Paulo State. Differences are related to land use and climate, in order to estimate soil carbon storage under various ecosystems and also to study the effects of high‐input agriculture on the chemical composition of soils with low activity clays. Within each land use, organic carbon in the topsoil is most strongly related to clay + silt content. This relationship is stronger for cropped, short savannah (cerrado) and tall savannah (cerradão) sites than for semi‐deciduous and evergreen forest sites. Losses of topsoil carbon with cropping can be predicted if the initial carbon and the clay+silt contents are known. The greatest carbon losses after long term cultivation occurred in forest mineral topsoils, ranging from 6% for perudic clayey soils to 37% for ustic sandy soils. No significant difference in carbon content was found between the paired savannah‐cultivated sites. In most of the originally less fertile soils cation exchange capacity was greater in the cultivated topsoil (Ap) than in the topsoil under savannah or forest (A1), probably because of liming and phosphate fertilization. Most subsoils at agricultural sites show increases in exchangeable bases (mainly Ca) and base saturation, but no significant change in pH. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

FTIR spectroscopy indicates that these two asymmetric-chain phospholipids contain a slightly greater number of kink, a considerably larger number of double-gauche, but a somewhat smaller number of end-gauche conformers than does dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, a symmetric-chain phospholipid having the same total number of carbon atoms in its hydrocarbon chains. Moreover, the asymmetric-chain phospholipids also contain a larger total number of gauche conformers, suggesting that their hydrocarbon chains are more disordered overall than are those of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. 2H-NMR studies of the specifically chain-perdeuterated analogs of these asymmetric-chain lipids reveal that the orientational order parameter profiles of their shorter and longer chains differ both qualitatively and quantitatively, regardless of whether they are esterified at the sn1- or sn2 positions of the glycerol molecule. The longer hydrocarbon chains exhibit unusual orientational order profiles in which the order gradient is steepest in the middle of the chain and relatively shallower in regions adjacent to the carboxyl and methyl termini, whereas the short hydrocarbon chains exhibit orientational order profiles typical of those commonly observed with conventional symmetric chain lipids. When compared at equivalent depths in the bilayer, the shorter hydrocarbon chains of the asymmetric-chain lipids are more orientationally disordered than are their longer chain counterparts. At comparable reduced temperatures, the shorter and longer chains of the asymmetric-chain lipids are more orientationally disordered than those of appropriate short and long symmetric-chain lipids, but the chain-averaged orientational order of the symmetric-chain lipid decreases more sharply with increases in temperature than does that of the comparable chain of the asymmetric-chain species. Moreover, the order plateau regions adjacent to the carboxyl groups of the longer chains of the asymmetric-chain phosphatidylcholines are shorter than those of symmetric-chain lipids of comparable hydrocarbon chain length. Overall, the data indicate that the conformational and orientational order in the liquid-crystalline states of these highly asymmetric-chain lipids differ significantly from those of comparable symmetric-chain lipids. Also, the unusual shape of the orientational order profile of the longer chains of the former is attributed to interaction between the methyl termini regions of the long chains with hydrocarbon chains in opposing monolayers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) © 1994, The Biophysical Society.

As a case study of the potential policy relevance of a process-oriented biogeochemical model, we estimated N2O emissions to the atmosphere from all agricultural lands in Florida, a state with significant agriculture on both organic and mineral soils. Nine landscape classes (3 soil classes × 3 annual rainfall classes) were coupled with county-based data on crops (5 major crops + pasture + fallow), fertilization, irrigation, and representative areas, to generate 86 model scenarios. Annual simulations were run for each case, and county and state emissions were tabulated. Total N2O emissions from Florida's agricultural lands were estimated to be 0.024 Tg N2ON y-1. Emissions were unevenly distributed with approximately 50 percent of the N2O being emitted from soils in six (of 68) Florida counties. Organic soils, while occupying only 9% of the total agricultural land area and receiving no nitrogen fertilizer additions, accounted for 38% of the state's total N2O flux. Sensitivity studies suggest that the most effective means for mitigating N2O emissions would involve a combination of measures including reductions in drainage of organic soils, injection of fertilizers to soil depths of 10 cm or greater, and increased attention to precision irrigation. Biogeochemical modeling will be critical to developing an integrated framework for assessing policies for reducing N2O emissions from agricultural systems. © 1994.",,"fertilizer; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; rain; agriculture; article; crop; fertilization; gas diffusion; geographic distribution; greenhouse effect; mineralization; model; soil; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028299970

The valence state of cobalt in Co-ferrierite and other Co-zeolite catalysts was found to be 2+. The dominant NO species adsorbed on Co-Y, Co-ZSM-5, and Co-ferrierite is in a dinitrosyl form appearing at 1810 and 1897 cm-1 for Co-Y and 1810 and 1890 cm-1 for Co-ZSM-5 and Co-ferrierite. The mononitrosyl form of the adsorbed NO is a minor species appearing at 1930-1935 cm-1 on all three samples. The mononitrosyl species on all samples is extremely weakly adsorbed. The dinitrosyl species adsorbed on Co-ferrierite is strongly adsorbed and needs to be heated above 300°C to desorb. Interestingly, the weakly adsorbed mononitrosyl species is enhanced in an O2 environment (100 Torr of O2) and is now stable to 200°C. However, in an oxygen environment, the dinitrosyl species is less stable, desorbing at ∼200°C. All adsorbed NO species disappear at &gt;200°C in 100 Torr O2, and adsorbed NO2 species were observed. NO2 adsorbed on Co-ferrierite shows a weakly adsorbed, covalent N2O5 in addition to stable species, such as nitro, nitrito, and nitrato species.

The P3 has been integrated in the Districts' environmental management program and incorporates the goals of the Districts' 30-year Master Plan called 2020 Vision. The Districts take a multi-media approach to environmental protection giving equal importance to emissions to air, water or the land. The Districts' P3 efforts, applied in combination with an aggressive Source Control Program, has resulted in significant reductions in heavy metals and other pollutant discharges to the environment. The P3 is a major element of the Districts' Source Control Program. During the past seven years, pollution prevention (the management of waste generation or reduction of waste before it is generated) has proven to be the most effective strategy to protect the environment. The Program has resulted in reductions in influent loadings of heavy metals and other pollutants of concern, and an improving record of compliance by major industrial dischargers. The reduction in metals and other pollutants has resulted in quantifiable improvements in environmental conditions in the marine environment (in the vicinity of the discharge) several miles offshore near the ocean outfall, in reduced air emissions from the treatment plants, and in the concentrations of heavy metals in the residual biosolids produced for recycling. Long-term monitoring data shows improvements in effluent toxicity (as measured by fish survival), reductions in the concentrations of metals in sediments around the ocean outfall and long-term gradual improvements in biological conditions as measured by the number of species of benthic invertebrates. Data on the trends for each of these and other conditions, are presented along with the specific methods employed to achieve the reductions from industrial dischargers. The successes of P3 were acknowledged by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which awarded the Districts the Administrator's national 1992 Pollution Prevention Achievement Award.","Heavy metals; Mass-based limits; Metal finishers; Pollution prevention; Sanitation agency; Waste minimization; Wastewater","heavy metal; benthos; conference paper; effluent toxicity; environmental management; environmental protection; fish; government; invertebrate; marine environment; pollution control; United States; waste water treatment plant; Invertebrata; Heavy Metals; Waste Water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028670674

Although NEVs hold the potential for large energy and environmental benefits, their introduction is hindered by two institutional barriers. The first of these is the federal safety standards designed for full-sized, gasoline-powered automobiles. The second is the California ZEV regulations that may not award ZEV credits to manufacturers for all vehicles certified as ZEVs, particularly very small NEVs. Also there are important inconsistencies in the vehicle definitions used in these and other regulations and vehicle codes. This has created confusion with regard to their applicability to various small vehicle designs.

The emission takes place in two phases. The most intense one lasts a few seconds and is followed by a second phase of lower intensity that remains for longer periods. This second phase presents chaotic or sustained oscillations. Free radicals are implicated in the luminescent process since the emission can be reduced by free radical scavengers such as 6‐hydroxy‐2,5,7,8,‐tetramethylchroman‐2‐carboxylic acid (Trolox) or ascorbic acid. These additives lead to a delay in reaching the maximum intensity, which can be related to their consumption, implying substantial recycling of the hemoprotein. Chemiluminescence is also observed in the oxidation of hemin by H2O2, suggesting a role for the heme group in the processes leading to the excited state production. The lower intensity observed in the presence of hemin can be related to the contribution of the globin chains. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

We studied the copper oxidation state change during the catalytic reaction using the X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) method. We observe that even under strongly net oxidizing conditions, a significant fraction of the copper ions in ZSM-5 is reduced to CuI at elevated temperature, when propene is present in the reactant stream. XANES spectra show that the CuI 1s → 4p transition intensity, which is proportional to cuprous ion concentration, changes with the reaction temperture in a pattern similar to the NO conversion activity. For comparison purposes, we also studied the CuI concentration change using a gas mixture in which propene was replaced by a stoichiometrically equivalent concentration of methane. Unlike propene, methane provides no NO selective reduction pathway over Cu-ZSM-5. No window of enhanced CuI concentration was observed using methane as the reductant. Our study indicates that, even in a strongly oxidizing environment, cupric ion can be partially reduced by propene to form CuI, possibly by way of allylic intermediate, which may be a crucial step for effective NO conversion through a redox mechanism. © 1994.","Cu-ZSM-5; in situ characterization; methane; NO; propene; selective reduction; XANES","Absorption spectroscopy; Catalyst selectivity; Characterization; Copper; Gas emissions; Hydrocarbons; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Redox reactions; Reduction; Gas mixture; Propene; X ray absorption near edge structure; Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028497484

Biophys. Res. Commun. 61 (1974) 502-509) and a preparation of 'fast' cytochrome c oxidase (Brandt, U., Schägger, H. and Von Jagow, G. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 182, 705-711), are compared in their reaction with cyanide and carbon monoxide. The reaction with cyanide is nearly as fast for the Van Buuren preparation as for the 'fast' preparation, but much slower for the Volpe-Caughey preparation. Mixed-valence cytochrome c oxidase (cytochrome a3 and CuB reduced with carbon monoxide bound and cytochrome a and CuA oxidized) is prepared by anaerobic incubation with carbon monoxide. With the Van Buuren preparation complete formation of the species takes 4 h, whereas with the Volpe-Caughey preparation it takes 20 h. Longer incubation under CO results in partial reduction of cytochrome a and CuA. With the 'fast' preparation mixed-valence cytochrome c oxidase is formed after more than one day of incubation with CO, but it is stable for at least 3 days. The presence of oxidized cytochrome c did enhance the reactivity towards cyanide and towards carbon monoxide in cytochrome c oxidase of all three preparations. Furthermore, optical and EPR spectra of the preparations of cytochrome c oxidase are compared. The Volpe-Caughey preparation has an intense g′ = 12 EPR-signal, the Van Buuren preparation has hardly any g′ = 12 signal and the 'fast' preparation has no g′ = 12 signal. In the 'fast' preparation the low-spin heme signal is shifted (from g = 3.00 to g = 2.97). The absorbance spectra of the three preparations in the Soret region are similar with a maximum at 424 nm. Only the 'fast' preparation as isolated was completely oxidized, whereas the other preparations were partially reduced. It was concluded that differences in the reaction of cytochrome c oxidase with ligands are determined by the internal or external ligand bound to the cytochrome a3-CuB couple. © 1994.","Cyanide; Cytochrome c oxidase; EPR; Ligand; Optical absorbance spectroscopy; Preparation method","cyanide; cytochrome c oxidase; absorption spectrophotometry; animal tissue; article; cattle; electron spin resonance; heart; ligand binding; nonhuman; priority journal; Carbon Monoxide; Comparative Study; Copper; Cyanides; Cytochrome a; Cytochrome-c Oxidase; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Formic Acids; Kinetics; Oxidation-Reduction; Spectrophotometry; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Animalia; Bos taurus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028301152

For every kilometer of travel, an intercity passenger train consumes only one-third as much energy per rider as a commercial airplane, and one-sixth as much as a single-occupant car. Rail alleviates traffic congestion, and it saves lives. To keep the rail revival on track governments must overcome decades of under-investment in rail. Even in Western Europe, where train use is heavy, countries spent about three times as much on roads as on rail during the 70s and 80s. Key policy steps include raising gas taxes and other user fees to reflect more closely the real cost of driving; making it convenient to reach train stations by public transport and bicycle; and guiding urban growth into less car-dependent patterns. -from Publisher",,"investment need; policy option; railway transport; transport planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028259206

Experimental evidences for the cluster compounds [M3(µ3-X)(µ-Y)3]4+ (M = Mo, W; X, Y = O, S, Se, Te) containing a puckered {M3(µ-Y)3} six-membered rings reveal benzene-like structural characteristics and chemical behaviours in a series of ligand substitution, addition, and oxidation reactions. The energy localized CNDO/2 molecular orbital method is applied to elucidate the nature of quasi-aromaticity in this type of cluster compound. The localized molecular orbitals (LMOs) of benzene as an aromatic prototype and a series of planar monocyclic polyene hydrocarbons CnHnq as well as certain typical conjugated six-membered rings are investigated, leading a deep- rooted inherent relationship between their aromaticity and bonding characteristics. The LMO analyses for these cluster compounds with [Mo3(µ3-X)(µ-Y)3]4+ show that in both benzene and such cluster compounds there exists a closed, smoothly continuous conjugated π-electron system, formed from three synergistically connected three-centred two-electron π bonds, which is a (p-p-p)π conjugated system in the former, but a (d-p-d)π one for the latter. The size and electronegativity of the bridging atom (p-Y) affect significantly the degrees of quasi-aromaticity in these cluster compounds with the core [M3(µ3-X)(µ-Y)3]4+ (Y = 0, S, Se, Te); on the other hand, the stronger interaction between the metal atom M and the terminal ligands with lone-pair electrons results in a smaller quasi-aromaticity of the puckered [M3Y3] ring.

This complex plays a central role in acetoclastic methanogenesis. The Ni/Fe-S component catalyzes CO oxidation and has been proposed to be involved in cleavage of acetyl-CoA into its methyl, carbonyl, and CoA moieties. In the work reported here, three metal centers in the Ni/Fe-S component were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry and pre-steady state kinetics. Center A contains nickel and iron and forms an EPR active adduct with CO, which is called the NiFeC species. The EPR spectrum of the NiFeC species has g values of 2.059, 2.051, and 2.029 and is observable at temperatures as high as 150 K. This signal had previously been observed only in the carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase complex of M. thermophila and the acetyl-CoA synthase from acetate-producing bacteria. Incubation of the CO-reduced Ni/Fe-S component with acetyl-CoA resulted in an increase in intensity of the NiFeC signal, which supports a role for the component in the cleavage of acetyl-CoA. Generation of the NiFeC EPR signal occurs with a rate constant of 0.4 s-1, a result that demonstrates the kinetic competence of this species in the acetyl-CoA cleavage reaction but rules it out as the site of oxidation of CO to CO2. Center B is likely to be a [4Fe-4S](2+/1+) center with g values of 2.04, 1.93, and 1.89 (g(av) = 1.95) and a standard reduction potential (E'0) of - 444 mV. At potentials less than -500 mV, another EPR signal develops that appears to originate from another state of Center B. Center C is a fast relaxing center with g values of 2.02, 1.88, and 1.71 (g(av) = 1.87) and an E'0 of -154 mV.",,"acetic acid; acetyl coenzyme a; acetyl coenzyme a synthetase; carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; iron; metal complex; nickel; sulfur; anaerobic metabolism; article; electron spin resonance; enzyme assay; enzyme chemistry; enzyme kinetics; methanobacterium; methanogenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; temperature; Aldehyde Oxidoreductases; Comparative Study; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Ethylene Glycol; Ethylene Glycols; Freezing; Iron; Iron-Sulfur Proteins; Methanosarcina; Nickel; Oxidation-Reduction; Protein Conformation; Species Specificity; Sulfur; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028307055

The steady-state simulation indicates that the nonplanar surface topology resulting from fabrication process causes current crowding near the edge of the emitting area where the surface step exists. Current crowding degrades the emission uniformity and also reduces the emission current under increased reverse bias. The nonplanar surface structure also causes punchthrough in the epitaxial layer as the reverse bias on the cathode increases. As a result, the percentage of the cathode current contributing to emission decreases, reducing the emission efficiency consequently. The simulation shows that the portion of the cathode current that flows through the emitting area drops to as much as 30% at cathode bias higher than 12 V, compared to the same current just after breakdown. This also affects the rate of increase in the total emission current which is the product of the emission efficiency and the overall cathode current. © 1994 IEEE",,"Efficiency; Electric currents; Electron emission; Microelectronic processing; Semiconducting silicon; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor device models; Semiconductor device structures; Semiconductor junctions; Topology; Vacuum applications; Current crowding; Silicon avalanche diodes; Two dimensional device simulator PISCES-IIB; Field emission cathodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028401498

A prior probability was constructed for the attenuation distribution with a Gibbs measure on a hierarchical deformable template while the activity distribution was modeled by a Markov random filed. By maximizing the joint posterior probability, the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimate of the distributions of both activity and attenuation was obtained.

This paper discusses a recent approach derived from an approximation of the mean values of the non-central multivariate hypergeometric distribution. The approximation leads naturally to a differential equation model of the exploration process. A Taylor series expansion results in a polynomial in the discovery number usable as an estimate of the mean value of future discovery amounts. Further considerations suggest a third order polynomial whose coefficients are functions of the underlying geological and behavioral parameters. Linear regression, on data from three partially explored plays, was used to estimate the coefficients, and it produces forecasting models which perform well compared with two other widely used methods. The paper presents a derivation of the differential equation and the third order polynomial model, examples of its use for three plays in Western Canada, and an assessment of the forecasting ability of the model for these plays. The differential equation model is compared in terms of accuracy and bias to the exponential decline and the mean historical discovery rate models and found to produce superior forecasts. © 1994.","Exploration; Gas; Oil","discovery process; forecasting model; hydrocarbon exploration; methodological aspect; modelling approach; Canada; Approximation theory; Differential equations; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Petroleum geology; Polynomials; Regression analysis; Linear regression; Noncentral multivariate hypergeometric distribution; Taylor series expansion; Petroleum prospecting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028665595

In one South American order, the Notoungulata, the advent of high-crowned teeth, which is classically interpreted as an adaptation for feeding on grasses (grazing), occurred at least 10 m.y. earlier than in northern hemisphere mammals. In order to understand these ancient diets and coevolutionary dietary shifts (from C3 to C4 plants), stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) from primary structural carbonate were analyzed from 41 tooth enamel samples of South American herbivores and northern hemisphere immigrants. These samples were taken from 10 localities spanning from about 25 m.y. to 7500 yr ago, i.e., during Tertiary isolation of South American followed by the Great American Interchange. Eight of these localities are currently situated at high-elevations (between 3200 and 4000 m) but are estimated to have been at much lower elevations prior to Andean uplift. Although there is a predominance of high-crowned, presumably grazing herbivores at Salla, the oldest locality sampled, δ13C values between -10.7 to -8.4%0 indicate feeding on C3 plants. During the middle Miocene (12.5-15 m.y.) δ13C values between -10.7 and -7.5%0 also suggest C3 plant communities, whereas during the late Miocene δ13C values between - 8.2 to -5.5%0 suggest mixed C3/C4 plant communities. Clear evidence of C4 plants (i.e., principally grasses) does not exist in the carbon isotopic signature of fossil mammal teeth until the Plio-Pleistocene, although it is less widespread because of elevational effects of the uplifting Andes. During the height of the Great American Interchange at 1 Ma, carbon isotopic data suggest food resource partitioning and specialization among immigrant herbivores such as horses and camels, whereas mastodons were more generalized feeders. There is considerable overlap of δ1C values between endemic and immigrant taxa, suggesting no discernable resource partitioning between them. The δ13C values of South American endemic mammals suggest that the low-crowned litoptern Macrauchenia fed on C3 plants whereas the high-crowned notoungulate Toxodon fed on C4 plants, presumably grasses. Although high-elevation (&gt; 3000 m) sites during the Plio-Pleistocene indicate C3-dominated communities, similar-aged localities at lower elevations (&lt; 2000 m) have mixed C3/C4 plant communities. The present-day biotic communities of the central Andes were established during the late Miocene and early Pliocene prior to about 3.5 Ma. © 1994.",,"Cainozoic; carbon-13; grazing; mammal; Notoungulata; palaeobiogeography; palaeodiet; Bolivia, Andes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028262530

Mullite (3Al2O3-2SiO2) and amorphous SiO2 are the principal products in all atmospheres. The amount of mullite formed is generally greater under vacuum and in reducing atmospheres, but the precise effect of the atmosphere is also modified by the presence of carbon. Vacuum and reducing atmospheres generally produce mullites of alumina: silica composition nearer 3:2 than 2:1 (estimated from unit cell measurements) and containing a higher proportion of Al*, i.e. tetrahedral aluminium associated with an oxygen defect (estimated by 27AlNMR measurements). The result of most significance to sialon formation is the detection by 29Si NMR of silicon oxynitride formation at 1200°C in systems containing either nitrogen or ammonia, in the presence of carbon. The preferential formation of Si-O-N bonds at such an early stage of the reaction under carbothermal conditions was confirmed by thermodynamic calculations, which also clarify other details of the complex interactions between the aluminosilicate, carbon, and the various gas atmospheres. © 1994 Chapman &amp; Hall.",,"Carbon; Composition; Firing (of materials); Nuclear magnetic resonance; Phase transitions; Reduction; Silicates; Thermodynamics; Vacuum; X ray analysis; Carbothermal reduction; Chemical bonds; Kaolinite; Mullite; X ray diffraction; Clay minerals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028545921

Both activity, calculated in terms of accessible platinum atoms, and selectivity to semi-hydrogenation were found to depend on the particle size. On highly dispersed catalysts, the turnover number and the selectivity were lower. The but-1-yne hydrogenation mechanism was studied using deuterium gas instead of hydrogen on the same catalysts. Using microwave spectroscopy for localisation of deuterium atoms in but-1-ene we found that, in addition to the cis addition of two deuterium atoms, 25% of the but-1-ene was produced by a different route which is a trans addition mechanism involving atomic and molecular deuterium. We also found that the isotopic dilution was greater for the formation of but-1-ene than for that of butane. The existence of two different types of catalytic sites on the catalyst surface is proposed: (i) The selective sites, which only lead to but-1-ene formation, are thought to be the faces of metal particles poisoned by reversible hydrocarbon deposits, in this case the reaction intermediates are vinylic adsorbed species. (ii) The non-selective sites, on which carbenes are formed and hydrogenated directly into butane, are largely accessible to hydrogen of the gas phase, they are considered to be localised on the edges and corners of metal particles. These non-selective sites are relatively more abundant on small metallic particles. © 1994.","deuterium; hydrogenation; mechanism; microwave spectroscopy; platinum; selectivity; semihydrogenation; tracer studies","Alumina; Butane; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Catalyst supports; Catalysts; Deuterium; Hydrogen; Microwave spectroscopy; Particles (particulate matter); Platinum; Silica; Butyne; Deuterium tracer; Isotopic dilution; Particle size; Hydrogenation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028467269

In this paper, the temporal and spatial patterns in natural plankton communities are interpreted as transient and stationary nonequilibrium solutions of dynamical nonlinear interaction-diffusion-advection systems. A simple model of phytoplankton-zooplankton dynamics (Scheffer, 1991) is presented in space and time. After summarizing the local properties as multiple stability and oscillations, the emergence of spatial and spatio-temporal patterns is considered, accounting also for diffusion and weak advection. In order to study the emergence and stability of these structures under hydrodynamic forcing, the interaction-diffusion-advection model is coupled to the hydrodynamic equations. It is shown, that the formation of nonequilibrium spatio-temporal density patterns due to the interplay of the deterministic nonlinear biological interactions and physical processes is a rare occurence in rapidly flowing waters. The two-timing perturbation technique is applied to problems with very rapid single-directed steady flows. A channel under tidal forcing serves as an example for a system with a relatively high detention time of matter. Generally, due to the different time and length scales of planktic interactions, diffusion and transport, initial nonequilibrium plankton patches are simply moved through the system unless the strong hydrodynamic forces do not destroy them before. © European Geophysical Society 1994.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984403055

The United States' Congress mandated a 10-year study, National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP), to examine the relationship between acid rain related emissions and environmental effects including visibility. It was found that averaging over both space and time (1 yr) that a 21 % improvement in visibility could be expected from a 10-million ton reduction in SOz emissions. The biggest improvement is expected along the Ohio River Valley. Examining the distribution of visibility improvements shows that 15 d yr-1 with lowest sulfate concentrations and least sulfate reduction there will be a just perceptible improvement, while on the other end of the spectrum 15 d yr-1 with the highest sulfate concentration and with the largest sulfate reduction there will be a 35% improvement in extinction. The paper also reviews the assumptions required to carry out the assessment and points out shortcomings in our understanding of the relationship between SO2 emissions and visibility. © 1994.","acid deposition effects; SO2 emission reduction; Visibility assessment","Acid rain; Air pollution control; Air quality; Atmospheric optics; Environmental impact; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Sensitivity analysis; Sulfur dioxide; Acid deposition effects; Emission reduction; Sulfate; Visibility assessment; Visibility; sulfur dioxide; acid precipitation; acid rain; air pollution; air quality; conference paper; particle size; priority journal; united states; visibility; acid deposition; emission reduction; sulphur dioxide; visibility assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028388853

No long-term trends are apparent in the concentration of organic carbon in shales, cherts and carbonates. The age distribution of 261 sample site localities sampled for well-preserved sedimentary rocks revealed a 500-700-Ma periodicity which coincided with tectonic cycles. It is assumed that the numbers of sites are a proxy for mass of sediments. A substantial increase in the number of sites in the late Archean correlates with the first appearance between 2.9 and 2.5 Ga of extensive continental platforms and their associated sedimentation. It is proposed that the size of the Proterozoic crustal organic carbon reservoir has been modulated by tectonic control of the volume of sediments deposited in environments favorable for the burial and preservation of organic matter.

Monoclonal antibodies to the membrane domain of human chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger proteins, AE1 and AE2, were prepared so that we might determine by immunohistochemical methods the presence and location of these antiporters in the human liver. To obtain the antibody against AE1, we immunized mice with injections of washed human erythrocytes. The selected monoclonal antibody was found to be specific for the 17‐kD proteolytic membrane fragment of AE1 protein. The antibody to AE2 was produced with a 14‐mer synthetic peptide, whose sequence corresponds specifically to amino acid residues 871 to 884 in the deduced primary structure of human kidney AE2 protein. When the monoclonal antibody to AE2 peptide was employed for the immunohistochemical study of liver specimens (by both immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase), a clearly defined staining was present at the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, as well as the luminal side of the membrane of bile duct epithelial cells from small and medium‐sized bile ducts. No staining was observed in the liver parenchyma with the monoclonal antibody to AE1, which instead strongly decorated the erythrocytes in liver blood vessels. We conclude that AE2 immunoreactivity is present in human liver, where it localizes very specifically to the membrane regions, which appear most probably involved in the transport of bicarbonate to bile (i.e., the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes and the apical side of epithelial cells of small and medium bile ducts).

Currently, many three-dimensional fabricating systems are nowadays widely used. However, the systems are at a high price because of the use of an expensive UV laser. An infrared (IR) laser is more economical and even powerful than UV laser. Hence, we tried to use CO2 laser due to reduction of the system cost and fabricating time of models, and we confirmed probability of building physical models. Figure 1 shows the configuration of the fabrication system which radiated on thermosetting polymer to laminate cured thin layers. The system used infrared CO2 laser with maximum optical power of 9.5 W (10.6 micron wavelength). The lens of 50 mm focus was made of CdSe, and the mirror was coated with gold. A Adeka cationic epoxy resin containing diluent and thermo initiator was used as the thermosetting polymer. Figure 2 shows the condition for the stable cure in the relationship between the density of thermo initiator and exposing light intensity. When thermosetting polymer is exposed to IR light under the stable condition, only the exposed areas immediately change from a liquid to a solid state by the process of thermopolymerization. However, higher optical power induces chain thermopolymerization of thermosetting polymer explosively, the polymer is all cured in the tank. In order to enlarge the stable condition, inert filler such as plastic powder contained in the polymer proved to be effective. Figure 3 shows the sample of 20-mm square models laminating 20 layers. The thickness of layers was 0.5 mm. The laser scanning speed was 10 mm/s. By these experiments, probability of building the model was confirmed.

Specifically, the daily 500‐hPa surface outputs of the Canadian Climate Center (CCC) and Max Planck Institute (MPI) (Germany) GCMs are linked stochastically, using a split sampling approach, to local temperature and precipitation in Nebraska. Three series of data are analyzed: historical data, 1 × CO2 GCM results and 2 × CO2 GCM results. Between these three data sets, no significant difference can be detected in either CP typology (constructed by principal component analysis and k means method) or stochastic properties of daily time series (Markov matrix). On the other hand, the average geopotential height of the 500‐hPa pressure field exhibits significant change, labeled the ΔCO2 effect, between the 1 × CO2 and 2 × CO2 cases. Accordingly, climate change is assumed to be represented by the historical average geopotential height augmented by the ΔCO2 increment. It is found that both the CCC and MPI GCMs lead to predicting a winter temperature increase of 3°–6°C, a smaller but significant increase in spring and fall temperatures, and no increase in summer. The probability of precipitation occurrence is found to remain almost unchanged, as well as the dry period duration. The estimates of local response to climate change depend upon the location and the GCM used for downscaling the CP. The MPI GCM, which includes an ocean‐atmosphere coupling, appears to yield smaller downscaled changes than the purely atmosphere‐based CCC GCM.

In the optical and UV, V347 Pup is a strong emission line source with a continuum spectrum which is remarkably red for a high-Ṁ cataclysmic variable. Consistent with its high inclination, we interpret the continuum spectrum as the superposition of the spectrum of the cool (Teff ≈ 7000 K) outer edge and the hot (Teff ≈ 100,000 K) inner regions of a self-eclipsed accretion disk. For the assumed parameters, the model matches the level and shape of the observed spectrum for an inclination of ≈88° and a distance of ≈300 pc. The prominent hump in the optical and UV light curves just before eclipse manifests the presence of the hot spot where the accretion stream strikes the edge of the disk. The wavelength dependence of the amplitude of the hump is best modeled by a spot having an effective temperature of ≈25,000 K and an area of ≈3 × 1018 cm2 if the spot radiates like a blackbody, or an effective temperature of ≈14,000 K and an area of ≈3 × 1019 cm2 if it radiates with a stellar spectrum. In either case, the hot spot produces only one-tenth of the predicted luminosity for the assumed mass-transfer rate of 10-8 M⊙ yr-1. Either the hot spot is ""buried"" in the edge of the accretion disk, or a significant fraction of its luminosity is radiated away in lines. The difference in azimuth between the peak of the hump and the dynamically expected location of the hot spot suggests that the spot's emitting surface is rotated forward by ≈36° relative to the edge of the disk. Phase-resolved optical spectroscopy demonstrates that the optical continuum and emission line regions in V347 Pup have the same radial extent, that the bulk of the Hβ emission line arises in the accretion disk but that it may also have a modest vertical extent, that the He λ4686 emission volume is both more sharply defined in the radial coordinate and less extended in the vertical direction, and that both the Hβ and He II λ4686 lines become narrower in eclipse, consistent with the eclipse of the inner, higher velocity, disk regions. In contrast, phase-resolved IUE spectroscopy demonstrates that the UV emission lines are only partially occulted in eclipse, indicating that they are formed in a region with dimensions comparable to the size of the secondary. Furthermore, the UV emission lines narrow only slightly in eclipse and have radial velocities which are delayed in phase relative to the optical emission lines by approximately 0.1 orbital cycles. The UV lines are modeled (poorly) by resonant scattering of accretion disk photons in a radially expanding wind emanating from the center of the disk. The required long acceleration scale and high wind mass-loss rate, combined with the prediction that the line widths should increase rather than decrease in eclipse, suggest that more complicated wind geometries may be necessary to explain the observed properties of the UV emission lines, including a possible rotational component near the disk plane and an additional emission component from the location of the hot spot. Finally, ROSAT survey observations indicate that V347 Pup is a weak and moderately soft X-ray source. Because of its high inclination, we argue that the X-rays do not come directly from the boundary layer but instead come from an extended emission volume. Possible sources of this emission include soft X-rays produced by shocks in the high-velocity wind and soft boundary layer X-rays which are scattered by the wind into the line of sight.","Binaries: eclipsing; Novae, cataclysmic variables; Stars: individual (V347 Puppis); Ultraviolet: stars",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044253186

The method leads to an algorithm whose computational cost scales linearly with the system size. The key features of our approach are (i) an orbital formulation with single-particle wave functions constrained to be localized in given regions of space, and (ii) an energy functional that does not require either explicit orthogonalization of the electronic orbitals, or inversion of an overlap matrix. The foundations and accuracy of the approach and the performances of the algorithm are discussed, and illustrated with several numerical examples including Kohn-Sham Hamiltonians. In particular, we present calculations with tight-binding Hamiltonians for diamond, graphite, a carbon linear chain, and liquid carbon at low pressure. Even for a complex case such as liquid carbon-a disordered metallic system with differently coordinated atoms-the agreement between standard diagonalization schemes and our approach is very good.

The objective was an understanding of how surface structure affects reactivity. HOPG basal plane exhibited much slower electron transfer rates than GC for all systems studied, and the observed rate constants were several orders of magnitude lower than those predicted from Marcus theory. In addition, HOPG did not adsorb several quinones which showed strong adsorption to GC under similar conditions. Any disturbance to the ordered basal plane (such as near defects) greatly increased electron transfer rates and adsorption. GC exhibited both fast kinetics and strong adsorption, provided the surface was clean. For the case of aquated Eu2+/3+, Fe2+/3+ and V2+/3+, mild oxidation of the GC surface greatly increases the observed rate, apparently via an inner-sphere catalytic route involving surface oxides. The results lead to the conclusion that both adsorption and electron transfer are suppressed at HOPG owing to the low density of electronic states near the Fermi level. Disorder at defects or in GC increases the density of states and causes the carbon to behave more like a metal. Activation of Eu2+/3+, Fe2+/3+ and V2+/3+ by oxidation is consistent with formation of a surface oxide complex via displacement of ligated water. © 1994.","Carbon adsorption; Electrolcatalysis; Electron transfer; Glassy carbon; Graphite","Adsorption; Carbon; Catalysis; Complexation; Electron transport properties; Electronic density of states; Fermi level; Graphite; Ions; Oxidation; Structure (composition); Water; Electrocatalysis; Glassy carbon; Quinones; Reactivity control; Surfaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028766105

The adsorption of four electroactive quinones was determined voltammetrically on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and fractured glassy carbon (GC). The average surface coverage on HOPG was 0.25–0.50, while that on GC was 2.7–4.0, consistent with GC surface roughness. STM of a large number of defects on HOPG yielded an average defect coverage of 0.01 ± 0.004, much too low to account for the observed adsorption by a simple geometric model. STM and adsorption measurements on identical HOPG surfaces showed that adsorption tracks observed defect area, but with the adsorption about 30 times higher than expected. High-resolution STM of HOPG revealed an electronic perturbation near the step defects which was larger than the defect itself by a factor of about 8. The results are consistent with quinone adsorption to the entire electronically perturbed region rather than to only the physical defect. The results are inconsistent with an adsorption mechanism based on specific chemical sites such as oxides or surface radicals. The results imply that adsorption of quinones on GC and defective HOPG depends on an electronic effect such as an electrostatic attraction between the adsorbate and partial surface charges, rather than a specific chemical effect. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

The ligand CL is subject to a protonation equilibrium with ground state pKa = 8.99 ± 0.06 and an approximate excited-state pKa = 10.5 ± 0.5. In 4:1 acetonitrile:water, the excited ligand CL* at pH &gt; 13.5 has λem = 419 nm (ϕem = 0.19), while the excited protonated ligand CLH+* at pH &lt; 7 has λem = 486 nm (ϕem = 0.86). In hexane the lifetime of the fluorescent excited state of CL was determined to be 2.00 ± 0.07 ns. In “dry” acetonitrile the emission came from both CL* and CLH+* but only one decay was resolved with π = 2.64 ± 0.03 ns. Picosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and emission decay studies of CL in 4:1 acetonitrile: water solution showed an absorption feature (λmax = 625 nm and τ = 9.6 ± 0.6 ns) which is assigned to CLH+* in an extensive hydrogen-bonding solvation network. Oxidative quenching of CL* by methyl viologen dication, p-benzoquinone, or Co(bpy)33+ in acetonitrile generated a common transient absorbance centered at 480 nm (ε ≈ 6000 M-1 cm-1) which is assigned to the cation radical CL+. Picosecond absorption spectroscopy of the zinc reference complex 4 showed an absorption feature (λmax = 625 nm) similar to that seen for CL in 4:1 acetonitrile: water and assigned to CLH+*. Excitation of 4 results in emission with λem = 486 nm (ϕem = 0.92) and τ = 9.3 ± 0.3 ns. While the chromophore-quencher complexes 1 and 2 show the same emission band as that seen for 4, the quantum yields and lifetimes of this emission are much reduced (ϕem = 0.03, τ= 3.14 ± 0.04 ns and ϕem = 0.22, τ = 4.2 ± 0.1 ns, respectively). Transient absorption studies of 1 and 2 both display oxidative quenching of the chromophore by Cu(II) as evidenced by the generation of cation radical CL+ absorbance. The charge separated state for both complexes is formed in less than 25 ps and decays with a lifetime of approximately 300 ps.

Wembley) to growth under elevated partial pressures of atmospheric CO2 (Ca).

By 12 d after ligule emergence, no significant difference in this parameter was detectable. At ligule emergence, plants grown at elevated Ca exhibited reduced in vitro initial activities and activation states of RuBisCO. At their respective growth Ci values, the photosynthesis of 40‐Pa‐grown plants was sensitive to p(O2) and to p(CO2) whereas that of 70‐Pa‐grown plants was insensitive.

The isolation of different carbon pools in the ocean environment and conversion to CO2 presents unique analytical problems for the radiocarbon chemist. In general, isolation and preparation of inorganic carbon presents few problems; dissolved carbon is easily extracted by acidifying the sample and stripping with an inert gas. Carbon is also readily isolated from particulate carbonate samples; in this case, CO2 is prepared by hydrolysis of the substrate with phosphoric acid. The isolation and preparation of organic carbon presents a much greater problem. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) must first be isolated from DIC and then oxidized in the presence of very high salt concentrations. We present results from a closed-tube combustion method in which the DIC-free seawater is evaporated to dryness, transferred to a clean combustion tube, and oxidized overnight at 550°C. Combustion of total organic carbon (TOC) in sediments with a high inorganic carbon content is also difficult. Removal of CaCO3 with acid leaves severely deliquescent salts which, if not thoroughly dried, cause combustion tubes to explode. Removal of the salts by rinsing can also remove significant amounts of organic matter. Finally, we present results from a local coastal region. © 1994.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001352797

Previously published work on the fluid/rock interactions which occur during the diagenesis of such sediments highlights that pH and redox are critical fluid parameters which control diagenesis and ore formation. However, except in modern surface water and shallow groundwater systems, these parameters cannot be measured directly, and must be estimated from theoretical considerations. These suggest that mixing between fluids of different redox states is likely to be a critical control on heavy metal mobility. Many diagenetic features can be explained largely by the chemical heterogeneity of red beds, and by the diagenetic ranges of redox conditions and pH which are among the greatest for any type of sediment. Such features include: the formation of red bed-hosted ore deposits; the extensive development of hematite; and the development of early diagenetic non-ferroan carbonate and late diagenetic ferroan carbonate cements. In order to develop theoretical models of fluid/rock interactions during such diagenesis, it is important to consider the interrelationships between fluid flow, mineral dissolution and precipitation, and sorption. At the present time such models are at an early stage of development. © 1994 The Geological Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052603248

Monitoring of regional vegetation and surface biophysical properties is tightly constrained by both the quantity and quality of ground data. Stratified sampling is often used to increase sampling efficiency, but its effectiveness hinges on appropriate classification of the land surface. A good classification must be sufficiently detailed to include the important sources of spatial variability, but at the same time it should be as parsimonious as possible to conserve scarce and expensive degrees of freedom in ground data. As part of the First ISLSCP (International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Program) Field Experiment (FIFE), we used Regression Tree Analysis to derive an ecological classification of a tall grass prairie landscape. The classification is derived from digital terrain, land use, and land cover data and is based on their association with spectral vegetation indices calculated from single‐date and multi‐temporal satellite imagery. The regression tree analysis produced a site stratification that is similar to the a priori scheme actually used in FIFE, but is simpler and considerably more effective in reducing sample variance in surface measurements of variables such as biomass, soil moisture and Bowen Ratio. More generally, regression tree analysis is a useful technique for identifying and estimating complex hierarchical relationships in multivariate data sets. 1994 IAVS ‐ the International Association of Vegetation Science","GIS; Konza Prairie; Remote sensing; Spectral vegetation index; Terrain stratification","biomass; GIS; prairie landscape; regression tree analyais; regression tree analysis; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil moisture; tallgrass prairie; vegetation sampling; USA, Kansas, Konza Prairie",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028555495

An obvious exception is the cytochrome P-450 system that is found in virtually all other tissues. In vitro studies, however, have shown that hemoglobin can be a broad monooxygenase catalyst, exhibiting the properties of a monooxygenase enzyme. Thus, catalysis by Hb displays typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, dependence on the native protein, coupling to NADPH-dependent flavoprotein reductases, and inhibition by carbon monoxide. The reconstituted system containing Hb along with P-450 reductase utilizes NADPH and OZ to catalyze typical monooxygenase reactions, including O- and N-demethylations as well as aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylations, and the catalytic cycle appears to mimic the typical P-450 mechanism. Turnover numbers for aniline hydroxylation are similar for Hb and P-450 reconstituted systems, whereas P-450 systems are more effective for other reactions. Catalysis by Hb seems to be restricted to the β-heme sites of the tetramer, reflecting more facile substrate access. Overall the similarities and differences between Hb and P-450 provide an opportunity to examine the basis for their differential monooxygenase or peroxidase/peroxygenase activities in a comparative manner. Hb may be especially useful in delineating the early events in the respective reaction schemes, because it can be studied in various stable redox/ligand states, including the oxyferrous form. Similar hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidative biotransformations occur within intact erythrocytes, but apparent turnover numbers are much lower than those with the reconstituted Hb system, suggesting different mechanisms of catalysis. Although Hb-mediated oxidase activity in erythrocytes is low relative to other sites of xenobiotic metabolism, it may contribute to in situ activation of xenobiotics leading to oxidative stress, disruption of sulfhydryl homeostasis in the erythrocytes, covalent modification of Hb, and hemolysis. © 1994, Elsevier Inc.

The ROMNET simulations used emissions projected to the year 2005, with meteorological conditions from July 1988. Predicted concentrations of PAN, HNO3, H2O2 and HCHO are shown along with O3 for the 2005 base case, allowing limited comparisons to be made with field observations and results from other modeling studies. Predicted secondary pollutant concentrations indicate an unusual degree of photochemical activity over much of the model domain, directionally consistent with the extreme nature of the July 1988 episode. Reducing NOξ emissions was predicted to reduce O3 in grid cells in which reactive nitrogen (NOy) concentrations were below about 25 ppb, but to be counterproductive for some cells with higher NOy. The New York City area where NOξ control was predicted to be counterproductive was characterized by very high NOξ to NOy ratios. Ozone was relatively insensitive to ROG controls in grid cells with NOy concentrations below 5-10 ppb. Comparison of unweighted ROG concentrations with concentrations weighted by HO rate constants (i.e. reactivity) showed that the latter varied less across locations. Predicted spatial gradients of NOy were generally sharper than those of reactivity-weighted ROG, supporting a dominant role for variations in NOy in controlling the sensitivity of ozone to its precursors. Reductions in reactivity-weighted ROG achieved with composition changes were similar to reductions achieved with ROG emissions cuts, explaining the similar response of ozone to these two control strategies. © 1994.","control strategies; Ozone modeling; reactive nitrogen","control strategy; emissions reduction; nitrogen oxide; ozone modelling; precursor level; reactive nitrogen; Air pollution control; Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Photochemical reactions; Emission reduction; Ozone precursor levels; Reactive organic gases (ROG); Regional Oxidant Modeling for Northeast Transport (ROMNET); Ozone; nitric oxide; organic compound; oxidizing agent; ozone; air pollution control; air quality; article; comparative study; geographic distribution; meteorology; nonbiological model; photochemistry; precursor; priority journal; Air Pollution; Emissions; Modelling/Control; Ozone; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028468609

Fluorescence anisotropy in the picosecond (ps) time region was analyzed using chlorosomes suspended in solution as well as those oriented in a polyacrylamide gel. When the main component of BChl c was preferentially excited, the decay of fluorescence anisotropy was found to depend on wavelength. In the chlorosome suspension, the anisotropy ratio of BChl c changed from 0.31 to 0.24 within 100 ps following excitation. In the baseplate BChl a region, this ratio decreased to a negative value (-0.09) from the initial 0.14. In oriented samples, the degree of polarization remained at 0.68 for BChl c, and changed from 0.25 to -0.40 for the baseplate BChl a by excitation light whose electric vector was parallel to the longest axis of chlorosomes. In the latter case, there was a shift from 0.30 to -0.55 by excitation perpendicular to the longest axis. Time-resolved fluorescence polarization spectra clearly indicated extensive changes in polarization plane accompanied by energy transfer. The directions of polarization plane of emission from oriented samples were mostly dependent on chlorosome orientation in the gel but not on that of the polarization plane of excitation light. Orientations of the dipole moment of fluorescence components was consistent with that of absorption components as determined by the linear dichroism (Matsuura et al. (1993) Photochem.

Analyses of the samples with Proton Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) gave information on elements heavier than Ne, Proton Elastic Scattering Analysis (PESA) on hydrogen contents, and the Laser Integrating Plate Method (LIPM) was used on the fine fraction to determine soot contents. Cluster Analysis is applied to the sample set in order to identify the emission sources of the elements. Additionally, the relationship to several meteorological variables is presented.

One heavy-duty engine, a DDC Series 60, used in highway trucks, and one medium-duty engine, Navistar DTA-466, used in pick-up and delivery type vehicles. The medium-duty engine was tested for engine out emissions and with two different sized exhaust oxidation catalysts. Both of the catalysts were composed of a ceramic monolith coated with a palladium type catalyst. Both engines were tested according to the US EPA transient emissions test on a series of diesel fuels blended with varying aromatics and PAH contents to determine the impact of fuel quality on emissions. All diesel fuels had a low sulphur content (&lt;0.05%) to minimize the formation of sulphate. The particulate matter was collected on teflon-coated filters, backed up with polyurethane foam filters to capture the vapour phase PAH. The PAH's were extracted from both filters with dichloromethane and measured by high resolution gas chromatography (GC) coupled to a low resolution mass spectrometer. In addition, a number of nitro-PAH's were analyzed by GC coupled to a high resolution mass spectrometer. In this way individual PAH and nitro-PAH molecules could be identified. Of 30 PAH compounds used for reference purposes, 21 were confirmed as present in the diesel exhaust from some of the engine/fuel combinations. Those compounds ranged in complexity from 2-ring naphthalene type compounds up to 6-ring benzoperylene. Based on a comparison of results between four test fuels there appears to be no relationship between total fuel aromatics and the total measured PAH emissions. However, there was a correlation found between the level of polyaromatics in the fuel and the PAH emissions. For example: Fuel F, with the highest level of 3+ring aromatics, gave significantly more 3+PAH emissions than the other three fuels. The highest level of specific PAH emissions were found to be 2, 6-dimethylnaphthalene, phenanthrene and fluorene with Fuels A, B and E. Fuel F produced more phenanthrene, pyrene and 1-methylpyrene. While fuel PAH content was found to have an influence on PAH emissions, the results also suggest this is not the only source. It is suggested that a significant proportion of the PAH emissions comes from the lube oil or is formed in the combustion process. In these tests, results indicate about 50 #g/bhp-hr of the measured PAH emissions are formed in this way. An 8.5L palladium exhaust catalyst (a non-production unit) fitted to the Navistar DTA 466 engine reduced PAH emissions, by an average of 76%. Similarly, a 5.0L palladium catalyst (a unit intended for production) tested with Fuel B, on the same engine, reduced PAH emissions by 62%. The exhaust extracts were also analyzed for 7 specific nitro-PAH compounds. These were confirmed present, with 1-nitropyrene and 9-nitroanthracene being the most commonly found. The 8.5L catalyst fitted to the Navistar engine increased the level of nitro-PAH emissions with 3 of the fuels, Fuel A, B and F, by 31-118%. The 5.0L catalyst, tested with Fuel B, increased these emissions by 206%. Conventional, regulated emissions (HC, CO, NOx and PM) and aldehyde emissions were also measured during this test program. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Anthracene; Aromatization; Catalysts; Dichloromethane; Diesel fuels; Fuels; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometers; Naphthalene; Palladium; Software testing; Sulfur compounds; Combustion pro-cess; Engine-out emissions; High-resolution gas chromatographies; Oxidation catalysts; Pickup and delivery; Regulated emissions; State-of-the-art technology; Transient emissions; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072434943

For farmers and farm managers, a decision regarding crop selection is a difficult task since a number of factors have to be considered. A solution of this predicament is an expert system that uses all available information to select the best suitable crops. In this article, the development of a PC-based expert system (CROPES) for selecting crops in a region in Tamilnadu, India, is presented. The system, acting as an intelligent consultant, asks a set of questions and then suggests appropriate crops. It recommends crops to a farmer at an early stage of crop planning based on location, climate, and farm level information pertaining to soils and available resources. The CROPES system was evaluated by specialists using farm data from a selection of farmers to assess its performance. It was found to be a valuable farm tool for crop selection. -Authors",,"crop selection; CROPES system; developing country; expert system; India; Tamil Nadu; Agricultural products; Expert systems; Crop selection; Seasonal crops; Software package CROPES; Winter wheat selection; Crops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028665788

Because of complaints of acute health symptoms, particularly in the state of Alaska, this program was terminated prematurely in that state. We designed a cross-sectional cohort study of self-reported symptoms of garage workers in the state of New Jersey exposed to high and low MJBE concentration environments. Two hundred and thirty-seven participants were divided into 2 groups: 115 workers in northern New jersey sampled during the wintertime oxyfuel program, and 122 workers in southern New jersey 10 wk after the phase-out date for the program in that area. The outcome measures included a list of symptoms, of which some were felt to be attributable to MTBE exposure. Participants were asked to indicate the frequency of those symptoms they had experienced over the last 30 days. In addition, workers were given identical preshilt and postshift questionnaires and asked to rank any discomfort they were experiencing at that time from a list of symptoms. In comparing all garage workers in northern New Jersey (high exposure) to those in southern New Jersey (low exposure), no differences were found in the reporting of symptom frequency over the last 30 days. In the pre-lpostshift questionnaire analysis, both groups felt significantly worse by the end of the work day, but there was no difference between the groups across the work shift. In comparing fuelers who pump gasoline more than 5 h/day, again no differences were found in the reporting of symptom frequency over the last 30 days. In the pre-lpostshift analysis, however, the northern group reported a significantly increased number of symptoms, but again no difference was found between the groups across the workshift. Because the fuelers in the north were on average 15 yr older than those in the south, this same analysis was repeated with fuelers in the north and age-, sex-, and education-matched controls in the south. In this analysis, no group differences in symptom reporting were seen. In summary, no untoward health effects clearly attributable to MTBE exposure could be demonstrated in this cohort of healthy garage workers. © 1994 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028191049

This study was undertaken to investigate gas exchange in two important grass species of the short‐grass steppe, Pascopyrum smithii (western wheat‐grass), C3, and Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama), C4, grown at different CO2 concentrations and temperatures. Intact soil cores containing each species were extracted from grasslands in north‐eastern Colorado, USA, placed in growth chambers, and grown at combinations of two CO2 concentrations (350 and 700 μmol mol−1) and two temperature regimes (field average and elevated by 4°C). Leaf gas exchange was measured during the second, third and fourth growth seasons. All plants exhibited higher leaf CO2 assimilation rates (A) with increasing measurement CO2 concentration, with greater responses being observed in the cool‐season C3 species P. smithii. Changes in the shape of intercellular CO2 response curves of A for both species indicated photosynthetic acclimation to the different growth environments. The photosynthetic capacity of P. smithii leaves tended to be reduced in plants grown at high CO2 concentrations, although A for plants grown and measured at 700μmol mol−1 CO2 was 41% greater than that in plants grown and measured at 350 μmol mol−1 CO2. Low leaf N concentration may have contributed to photosynthetic acclimation to CO2. A severe reduction in photosynthetic capacity was exhibited in P. smithii plants grown long‐term at elevated temperatures. As a result, the potential response of photosynthesis to CO2 enrichment was reduced in P. smithii plants grown long‐term at the higher temperature. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

The enhanced confinement mode with the edge transport barrier ( H-mode) in JT-60U is characterized by the high edge ion temperature. The confinement improvement is well correlated with the edge ion temperature. The H-mode at low magnetic field ( approximately 2 T) in JT-60U has similar features to the H-mode in JFT-2M: rapid reduction of Dalpha emission. However, in the H-mode at high magnetic field ( approximately 4 T) and at low density, no clear transition is observed in JT-60U, although the confinement is still improved with the edge transport barrier. Collisionality and the width of the transport barrier are also investigated in both tokamaks, and are compared with Shaing's theory (1989). Improvement of the high-pp mode discharge with the H-transition was demonstrated in JT-60U. Owing to this improvement, the record value of the fusion triple product (1.1*1021 m-3 s keV) has been achieved. Quasi-steady H-mode operation with H-factor of approximately 1.8 has been also demonstrated in JT-60U by controlling the repetition rate of edge localized modes (ELMs).

Their objective is to reduce the number of occupant complaints, and not necessarily to reduce the risk associated with such complaints. Clearly, reduction of the risk would require greater investment of funds and effort. This paper focuses on individuals and the amount of money they are willing to invest in order to reduce risks associated with indoor air pollution in their home. Psychologists assert that lay judgement of risks are influenced by cognitive biases and attitudes. This study investigates the possibility that cognitive elements and general attitudes influence not only the perceived risk associated with exposures to indoor air pollutants, but also the willingness of individuals to invest in order to reduce the risk. A three-stage study was performed to determine some of the factors that influence public decisions to control the quality of the air inside their home. The study is focused on the design of a risk ladder, and the survey of 400 randomly selected individuals in the Chicago metropolitan area. The survey was designed to determine if demographics, smoking, education, or income influence the desire of individuals to invest in order to reduce indoor air pollution. The following conclusions were reached: (i) public awareness of indoor air pollution is high; (ii) media campaigns on indoor air pollution affect the determination of the specific pollutant the public perceives as important, but do not influence the public's desire to invest larger amounts of money to reduce risks from exposures to air pollutants in the residential environment; (iii) the public is not willing to spend large amounts of money to reduce indoor residential air pollution; (iv) education does not affect the level of awareness regarding indoor air pollution, but it increases the willingness to invest in an effort to reduce indoor air pollution; and (v) smoking status does not affect any of the above. © 1994.","cognitive elements; Indoor air pollution; public perception of risks; risk ladder; risk reduction","Risk ladder; Risk reduction; Air quality; Cognitive systems; Decision theory; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Indoor air pollution; air quality; ambient air; article; attitude; awareness; clinical trial; cognition; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; decision making; demography; education; home; human; income; indoor air pollution; investment; normal human; priority journal; psychologist; public opinion; randomized controlled trial; risk; smoking; united states; work environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028533299

We account for the two-dimensional (2D) density of states below the barrier, assume thermal equilibrium of carriers within the well, allow for the possibility of strain in the well and/or barrier, and include the contribution to electron thermionic emission from indirect conduction band minima. Our expressions for thermionic emission reduce, in the limit of large well width, to those derived by assuming a three-dimensional (3D) density of states. The results for electron emission from GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs quantum wells with x = 0.2 and x = 0.4 barriers at room temperature agree well with experiment. For wells with x = 0.2 barriers, thermally assisted tunneling overtakes thermionic emission around 40 kV/cm, while for wells with x = 0.4 barriers thermionic emission from the L valley conduction band minima dominates for fields less than 70 kV/cm. For holes we show that the escape rates are very sensitive to the in-plane effective masses, and results using simple expressions for the in-plane masses that do not include light/heavy-hole mixing agree poorly with experiment. The agreement with experiment is improved using in-plane masses that include ligbt/heavy-hole mixing, particularly for wells with high barriers. We suggest that agreement with experiment would be improved by using more accurate in-plane hole masses for all of the subbands. © 1994, IEEE.",,"Band structure; Calculations; Charge carriers; Electric field effects; Electron emission; Electron tunneling; Semiconducting aluminum compounds; Semiconducting gallium arsenide; Thermodynamic stability; Three dimensional; Electron thermionic emission; Fowler Nordheim tunneling; Photogenerated carrier escape rate; Quantumwell waveguide photodetector; Semiconductor quantum wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028405143

The coding region dis 69.3% identical to its counterpart in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScQCR7). Like the KlQCR8 gene (Mulder et al., accompanying paper) expression of the KlQCR7 gene during growth on glucose is high and can be further induced when cells are grown on non-fermentable carbon sources. The chromosomal linkage of the APA2 and QCR7 genes is conserved between S. cerevisiae and K. lactis. The intergenic regions containing the QCR7 promoters of the two yeasts, differ significantly in length and lack overall DNA sequence similarity, but they do share a binding site for the transcription factor complex HAP2/3/4. The KlQCR7 promoter contains, in addition, a CPF1 consensus binding site which is absent from ScQCR7. Deletion of a 35 bp region containing these two sites severely lowers the mRNA expression during growth on both glucose and ethanol/glycerol, but growth rate on both carbon sources is only mildly affected.

Vector control technology in the first half of this century was relatively simple, utilizing source reduction, larvivorous fish, petroleum hydrocarbon oils, and some simple synthetic and botanical materials. During the 2nd half of this century, however, various classes of synthetic organic chemicals, improved petroleum oil formulations, insect growth regulators, synthetic pyrethroids, and microbial control agents were developed and employed in mosquito control and control of other disease-vectoring insects. Among these groups of control agents, petroleum oil formulations have endured to be used through the whole century. It is likely that petroleum oil formulations, insect growth regulators, and microbial control agents will provide the main thrust against vectors at least during the first quarter of the 21st century. It is also possible that effective tools through the development of vaccines and molecular entomology techniques might become available for the control of vectors and vector-borne diseases during this period of the 21st century.",,"insecticide; animal; article; disease carrier; forecasting; history; methodology; mosquito; pollution; United States; zoology; Animals; California; Entomology; Environmental Pollution; Forecasting; History, 20th Century; Insect Vectors; Insecticides; Mosquito Control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028724816

For clean W(110) and alkali coverages up to 0.2 monolayers (ML) (in terms of adsorbed layers at room temperature) only electron emission due to Auger capture is seen. With increasing alkali coverage Auger processes involving core excited atomic states (above 0.2 ML) and Feshbach resonances (above 0.55 ML) produced by the resonant transfer of one or two electrons to the projectile, respectively, dominate. For excited O+ ions we see also Auger processes in which the respective core excited states and Feshbach resonances do not decay to multiplet states of the neutral ground state configuration, but rather to lower core excited states.

We performed a photon/fragment-ion coincidence experiment following 2 MeV H+, He+, and He++ impact on CF4 and CHF3 with the objective to clarify the nature of the emitter and to study the dynamics of the emission process. In the case of the CF4 molecule, we observed that the photons in the 200-500 nm range are quantitatively coincident with CF 3+ fragments. From the structure of the coincidence peak, we derived the kinetic energy released during the dissociation process and compared it with the optical spectrum and the total available energy. It follows that the CF3+ ions are vibrationally and/or rotationally highly excited. The continuous emission is explained by a radiative decay of the CF4+(C∼ 2T2) state to the.CF4+(X∼ 2A1) repulsive potential surface which dissociates quickly into CF3 + and a fluorine atom. In the case of the CHF3 molecule, we observed coincidences between photons in the 200-500 nm range and CHF 2+ fragments. A process similar to that in the CF 4 molecule seems to take place with the CHF3 +(D∼) state as the precursor. In the same spectral range, a band of electronically excited CF*2 radicals seems also to be present. No coincidences between photons in the 200-500 nm range and CF3+ were observed which excludes the CF3 +* as a precursor of the continuous bands in the case of CHF3 and makes it very unlikely in the case of CF4. © 1994 American Institute of Physics.",,"Carbon inorganic compounds; Dissociation; Fluorine compounds; Free radicals; Ionization; Ions; Light emission; Molecules; Particle detectors; Photons; Ultraviolet radiation; Electron excitation; Kinetic energy; Photon fragment ion coincidence; Photon ion coincidence apparatus; Radiative decay; Molecular physics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028405384

Conformers with an anti acid hydrogen are local energy minima for the aliphatic acids and for the nonplanar benzoic acid; however, arrangements with an sp2 hybridized β carbon and with a planar heavy atom skeleton correspond to transition structures.

Results obtained at the MP2/6-311++G**//MP2/6-31G* level for acetic acid and benzoic acids show that the calculated energy separation decreased by 1-2 kcal/mol. The syn/anti rotation barrier for the benzoic acid carboxylic hydrogen was estimated at 12.6 kcal/mol at this level.

(2) With decreasing injection pressure, smoke sharply increases with a large hole-dia. nozzle but does not increase with small hole diameter of less than 0.20 mm. The decrease of injection pressure reduces NOx emission. ( 3 ) The effect of suppressing the increase of smoke with a small hole-dia. nozzle is considered to be caused mainly by the rapid temperature rise over about 1 800°C in the fuel- rich region near the spray in flame. ( 4 ) With the conversion of a deep bowl combustion chamber to a shallow-dish one, smoke increases as injection pressure decreases, in spite of the use of a small-hole-dia. nozzle, due to the reduction of mixing effect. © 1994, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

Four different secondary air-injection systems and various primary air-distribution patterns along the grate were investigated using a computational fluid dynamic model, in an attempt to obtain optimum combustion conditions that would minimize potential emissions of toxic pollutants and reduce maintenance costs at the plant. The modeling work showed that the use of four large high-speed secondary air jets firing toward a common center, together with optimizing the primary air distribution along the grate, produces substantially longer residence times and improves temperature profile at the exit. The novel feature of the proposed secondary air-injection system is the formation of a large and significantly strong recirculation zone, located above the burning refuse bed, in the middle of the furnace shaft. This strong recirculation zone improves the overall performance of the incinerator due to intensive mixing of hot gaseous products evolving from the refuse bed with the combustion air supplied as the secondary air, and greatly improves the gas phase combustion and helps to reduce emissions of chlorinated organic compounds. Results obtained clearly demonstrate that the proposed secondary air-injection system has an excellent potential to satisfy most requirements for emissions levels and gas resident times specified by the European Directives (EEC) for municipal incinerators with a vertical radiation shaft. © ASCE.",,"Air injection systems; Combustion air; High speed secondary air jets firing; Maintenance costs; Municipal solid waste incinerator; Refuse bed; Toxic pollutants; Combustion; District heating; Furnaces; Industrial plants; Modification; Organic compounds; Performance; Shafts (machine components); Waste heat utilization; Refuse incinerators; article; combustion; heating; incineration; mathematical model; solid waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028533971

Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1110 West Green Street, Urbana, IL 61801-3080, United States","A new aspect of the propagation of astrophysical maser radiation in the presence of a magnetic field is described in which circular polarization is created. The resulting antisymmetric spectral line profile for this circular polarization resembles that produced by the ordinary Zeeman effect when the Zeeman splittings are much less than the spectral line breadth. It is caused by the change, with increasing maser intensity, in the axis of symmetry for the molecular quantum states from a direction that is parallel to the magnetic field to a direction that is parallel to the direction of propagation. When the maser is radiatively saturated, and the rate for stimulated emission is within an order of magnitude of the Zeeman splitting in frequency units, this ""intensity-dependent circular polarization"" is greater than that due to the ordinary Zeeman effect by factors as large as 1000. The circular polarization that is observed in the spectra of circumstellar SiO (J = 1-0) masers associated with late-type giants and supergiants may then be caused by magnetic fields as weak as about 10 mG. With the standard Zeeman interpretation of the observations, magnetic fields of 10-100 G are indicated. The lower fields are similar to the limits obtained from the observation of the 22 GHz water masers which are typically somewhat further from the central star. The observed tendency for the fractional linear polarization of SiO masers to increase with increasing angular momentum of the molecular state is shown to be a likely result of anisotropic pumping. Errors are identified that invalidate a recent conflicting claim in the literature about the basic theory of maser polarization in the regime that is relevant here.","Circumstellar matter; Masers; Polarization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044253923

In the last few years, under the pressure of fear of accusation of a paternalistic attitude, this postulate has been changed to 'voluntas aegroti suprema lex'. The question stands: Is this valid in each case and in all the situations? For example, it is possible to use compulsory treatment with those who have not given their informed consent. Even the charter of basic human rights and freedom states in its article 6 that everyone has a right of life. The law specifies in which cases an individual can be accepted or can be held in a health care institution without his/her consent. In cases of so-called 'hunger strikers', the strikers refuse food and expose themselves to extreme starvation in order to reach some political goals or to express their views. If, in such situations, the patient endangers his/her life, the physician who is facing this problem is, according to Czech law and similarly to some other Central European laws, and according to the Ethical Code of the Czech Medical Chamber, bound to act to protect and restore the life and the health of that person. The Health Care Act No. 540 1991 of the Czech Republic states the obligation to provide emergency care to anyone whose life or health is threatened. Compulsory treatment is possible, for example, if an individual shows signs of mental disease or if an intoxication threatens him or his neighbourhood. Long-lasting starvation certainly leads to severe autointoxication and therefore makes medical intervention legal in a state of utmost emergency. © 1994.","Ethical problems; Hunger strikers; Medico-legal problems","attitude; conference paper; food intake; human; human rights; informed consent; medical ethics; medicolegal aspect; physician; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028610539

Current data on stratigraphical and geographical distribution pattern show that their biogeographical history is closely related to Mediterranean-Tethyan structural and climatic changes. The group first appeared in the Aptian in the central Tethys (southwestern Europe) and developed and diversified remarkably in the Late Cretaceous through the subgenera Hemiaster (Hemiaster), H. (Bolbaster) and H. (Leymeriaster). Marked morphological changes arose in the early Paleogene when new Tertiary forms H. (Trachyaster), Opissaster and Ditremaster, originating in the Caribbean and Madagascan regions, respectively, replaced H. (Bolbaster) which partly survived and H. (Hemiaster) and H. (Leymeriaster) which disappeared entirely. These new forms achieved their greatest diversity during the Eocenee and thrived in the Mediterranean basin until it was sealed off from the Indo-Pacific in the Middle Miocene. Then Late Neogene climatic and structural events reduced hemiasterids to only a few Mediterranean species. The survivors of modern groups persisted in refuge areas of the western Mediterranean until middle Messinian times before being reduced to only one species, the last fossil one, during the Pliocene. Then, the Cenozoic groups H. (Trachyaster) and Opissaster definitively disappeared. Outside the Mediterranean basin primitive H. (Bolbaster) and modern Ditremaster, which colonized deep-water Atlantic environments from the Late Cretaceous and Middle Miocene respectively, survived the Messinian and Plio-Pleistocene climatic crises. They flourished in the northern Atlantic where their present-day descendants Ditremaster (Sarsiaster) griegii and H. (Bolbaster) expergitus still survive. H.

Intracellular pH was monitored using ratio imaging of the indicator dye BCECF as extracellular Pco2 was varied. The extracellular solution was switched rapidly (141 ms rise time) from a HEPES buffered to a CO2‐HCO−3 buffered solution (both pH 7.4). Introduction of CO2‐HCO−3 produced a rapid cell acidification. Cell pH dropped from a steady‐state pH of 7.02 in HEPES solution to pH 6.81 in CO2‐HCO−3. Methazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, dramatically reduced the initial rate of acidification, demonstrating that the acidification was produced by the carbonic anhydrase‐catalyzed hydration of CO2. The initial rate of acidification, 52.6 pH units per min (0.88 pH units per s), was reduced ∼ 150‐fold to 0.36 pH units per min by 10−3 M methazolamide. Half‐maximal inhibition occurred at a methazolamide concentration of 5.6. 10−7 M. The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (10−3 M) also greatly reduced the rate of cell acidification. The latency to the onset of carbonic anhydrase inhibition was 660 ms for methazolamide and 7.5 s for acetazolamide. The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor benzolamide (10−4 M, 4 min exposure), which is poorly membrane permeant, had little effect on the rate of cell acidification, indicating that the site of carbonic anhydrase action was intracellular.

Formate metabolism to CO2 is governed by tissue H4folate and 10-FTHFDH levels. Presumably, rats are not normally susceptible to formate toxicity because they possess high hepatic H4folate and 10-FTHFDH levels. However, the ability of target tissues to metabolize formate is not known. Therefore, studies were performed to determine whether 10-FTHFDH was present in rat retina, optic nerve, and brain. 10-FTHFDH levels were determined using Western blot analysis of mitochondiral and postmitochondrial preparations from these tissues. Hepatic mitochandrial and postmitochondrial levels of 10-FTHFDH were 13 and 12 ng/μg protein, respectively. Postmitochondrial levels of 10-FTHFDH in rat retina, optic nerve and whole brain were 0.2, 1.3, and 2.1 ng/μg protein; mitochondrial values in retina and brain were 0.2 and 1.5 ng/μg protein, respectively.

This paper reviews major factors affecting S cycling and efficient utilization of S fertilizers and soil S reserves in grazed grasslands. Models used for quantitatively describing S cycling in these ecosystems are also discussed. The review shows that most (95%) of the total soil S in intensively managed grazed grasslands is present as organic S and the remainder is in readily soluble and adsorbed S. Soil organic S that has been accumulated with time in grazed grasslands receiving regular S fertilizer applications can provide a significant amount of S for plant S nutrition. Carbon-bonded S is the major (50-85%) form of soil organic S, owing to the regular return of animal excreta and plant litter. Grazing animals have a major effect on the amount and rate of S cycling as most (87-90%) of S ingested by grazing animals is returned to soils as excreta. Excretal S is either recycled or subjected to leaching losses and transferred to stock camps. Leaching losses are expected to be higher in camp than in non-camp areas as camp soils contain higher soil organic and inorganic S fractions. Likewise more soil organic S is mineralized in camp than non-camp soils. This may provide S exceeding that taken up by plants and hence could lead to substantial S leaching losses in camp areas. This review identifies the lack of quantitative data on: (1) effects of soil microbial activity and plant S uptake on the fate of applied S fertilizers and excretal S in grazed grassland; (2) rates of soil S transformations as influenced by management and seasonal variables; (3) the contribution of soil organic S to plant S uptake and leaching losses in camp and non-camp areas of grazed grasslands. This scarcity of quantitative data is a major constraint in the development of dynamic S cycling models for predicting rates of S cycling and for estimating plant S requirements in grassland ecosystems where S cycling has not attained a steady state. When a steady state exists, mass-balance S models are more reliable than the traditional practice of using only soil or plant S tests for assessing long-term annual plant S rerequirements. © 1994.",,"fertiliser; grassland soil; grazing; model; sulphur cycling; sulphur fertiliser",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028159960

The phase transition between Lα and L2 ( 10 wt% water) occurs in the temperature range 43-46°C. Already at about 32°C the LD value for the COH stretching vibration has decreased to 50% of its value at 25°C. A similar relative decrease in LD is obtained for the CO stretch and the asymmetric COOC stretch at about 38°C and for the CHCH stretch at about 43°C.

Lab simulations which model biological responses to atmospheric change are difficult to translate into natural settings owing in part to the vertical migration of phytoplankton. In the sea this vertical migration acts to regulate actual carbon dioxide consumption. To capture some critical properties of this vertical material transfer, we monitored the effects of atmospheric CO2 on dense suspensions of bioconvecting microorganisms. Bioconvection refers to the spontaneous patterns of circulation which arise among such upwardly swimming cells as alga, protozoa, zoospore and large bacteria. Gravity, phototaxis and chemotaxis have all been implicated as affecting pattern-forming ability. The ability of a biologically active suspension to detect atmospheric changes offers a unique method to quantify organism adjustment and vertical migration. With increasing CO2, bioconvection patterns in alga (P. parva) and protozoa (T. pyriformis) lose their robustness, and surface cell populations retreat from the highest CO2 regions. Cell movement (both percent motile and mean velocity) generally diminishes. A general program of image analysis yields statistically significant variations in macroscopic migration patterns; both fractal dimension and various crystallographic parameters correlate strongly with carbon dioxide content. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"air-sea flux; atmosphere/ocean exchange; biological effect; carbon dioxide; laboratory simulation; laboratory study; oxygen; phytoplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028581909

Cumulative oil production to date is approximately 16.5 MMBO. Recent increases in project maintenance costs, excessive waste gas production and treatment expense, as well as new regulatory limitations on hydrocarbon emissions prompted a review of the technical and economic viability of the project. The study centered around the estimation of current incremental oil due to air injection, which was derived using several analytical and empirical methods. The relative contributions of other potential recovery mechanisms were estimated analytically. The sum of these predicted contributions matched the cumulative production quite well. In addition to estimating volume of oil produced by combustion, theoretical burn volumes were calculated and mapped for each of six reservoir subzones. These maps were confirmed using well log and field data. Several economic scenarios, including status quo operation, project expansion, and suspension of air injection, were investigated.

The addition of exogenous organic matter (rice straw) or soil amendments with the presence or absence of vegetation were also examined for their influence on methane emissions. The total methane emission over the growing season varied from 3.2 g CH4 m-2 y-1 without the addition of rice straw to 49.7 g CH4 m-2 y-1 with rice straw and microbiological amendment. In the unvegetated plot with the addition of rice straw, there was much ebullition of gas bubbles, particularly in the summer. The annual methane emission due to the ebullition of gas bubbles,from the unvegetated plot with the addition of rice straw was estimated to be almost the same as that from the vegetated site with the addition of rice straw. In the early growth stage, the methane flux can be analyzed by the diffusion model (Flux=Methane concentration × Conductance of rice body) using parameters for methane concentration in the soil water as a difference in concentration between the atmosphere and the rhizosphere, and for the biomass of rice as a conductance of rice body. On the other hand, although the diffusion model was inapplicable to a large extent from the middle to late growth stage, methane flux could be estimated by air temperature and concentration in the soil water. Thus, methane transport from the rhizosphere to the atmosphere through rice plants consisted of two phases: one was an explainable small part by diffusion in rice body; the other was a large part strongly, governed by air temperature. The existence of gas bubbles in the soil may be related to the transition between the two phases © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","diffusion; gas bubbles; methane; rice paddy; soil water; transport","air temperature; gas bubble; methane flux; seasonal variation; soil water; Japan, Honshu, Ibaraki Prefecture, Tsukuba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028163988

These VSTEPs have several functions, such as light emission, light detection, memory, and logical operation. Recently, a pnpn VSTEP with a vertical cavity (VC-VSTEP), which operates as a laser in the on-state, has been demonstrated. To obtain a highly integrated 2D array, low consumption power for each device is needed. Therefore, we have to reduce threshold current. Here, threshold reduction by photon recycling is reviewed. The sidewalls of VC-VSTEPs are covered with gold film which has high reflectivity. This gold film retains spontaneously emitted photons in the optical cavity, and a large part of spontaneously emitted photons is absorbed and the carriers are regenerated. This photon recycling of spontaneous emission can reduce the threshold current without sacrificing the light-output power in contrast to microcavity lasers.",,"Applications; Integrated optics; Light emission; Optical interconnects; 2D integration; Light detection; Photon recycling; Vertical cavities; Vertical surface transmission electrophotonic devices; Optical devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028728703

Apparently conflicting experimental findings could be the result of differences in genetic potential11-15 and resource availability16-20, different experimental conditions21-24 and the fact that many studies have focused on individual components of the system2,21,25-27 rather than the whole ecosystem. Here we present results of an in situ experiment on the response of an intact native ecosystem to elevated CO2. An undisturbed patch of tussock tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska, was enclosed in greenhouses in which the CO2 level, moisture and temperature could be controlled28, and was subjected to ambient (340 p.p.m.) and elevated (680 p.p.m.) levels of CO2 and temperature (+4 °C). Air humidity, precipitation and soil water table were maintained at ambient control levels. For a doubled CO2 level alone, complete homeostasis of the CO2 flux was re-established within three years, whereas the regions exposed to a combination of higher temperatures and doubled CO2 showed persistent fertilization effect on net ecosystem carbon sequestration over this time. This difference may be due to enhanced sink activity from the direct effects of higher temperatures on growth16,29-33 and to indirect effects from enhanced nutrient supply caused by increased mineralization10,11,19,27,34.

The test section of creep testing machine was designed and constructed with special care for impurity chemistry in helium. A device for counting Moire patterns was developed for contamination-free creep strain measurement. The test results up to 10,000 h showed no significant degradation in creep properties. Comparing the data on the stresses to rupture, to cause 1% total strain and to the onset of tertiary creep, the stress to cause 1% total strain is judged to be the dominant factor for the allowable stress (St) in the ASME Code. Carbon analysis for ruptured specimen showed that caburization was limited to the region near the ruptured portion and slight carbon intrusion occurred only in the early stage of exposure. Surface cracks were not responsible for creep-rupture, because they were blunted at the depth of approximately 100 μm from the specimen surface at 1,173 K and 200 μm at 1,273 K. Internally formed cracks were initiated at the sites of carbide precipitation at grain boundary, growing nearly perpendicular to the stress axis. Recrystallization observed was localized at 1,173 K but became pronounced at 1,273 K. Creep deformation enhanced coasening of the grain boundary carbide under tensile stress. © 1994, Atomic Energy Society of Japan.

The rms frequency error for benzene is ca. 20 cm-1 in the MO/8 model, which is better than those for unsealed ab initio calculations in the Hartree-Fock level (ca. 100-130 cm-1), the MP2 method (ca. 50 cm-1), and local density functional (LDF) and coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) methods (ca. 30 cm-1). The MO/8 model requires only topological connections of benzenoid rings for its application to any size of polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons. Without any knowledge except for the structure formula the MO/8 model was applied to kekulene (C48H24), and on this basis spectral intensities were calculated. The results were found to be in good agreement with available experimental data including IR, fluorescence, and phosphorescence spectra. The essential nature of the benzenoid force field was proved to be governed by the topology of the carbon network, which was effectively incorporated in the MO/8 model for describing highly correlated motions of CC bonds in conjugated systems. © 1994 American Chemical Society.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000714430

In all cases, leaching of the fine fractions results in a high 147Sm144Nd (0.09-0.29) acid-soluble component and a complementary low 147Sm144Nd (0.05-0.14) residual component. The observed fractionation is an ancient feature related to diagenesis, burial and metamorphism. The magnitude of Sm-Nd fractionation between leachates and residues, as well as the resulting Sm-Nd ages, vary as a function of grain size and metamorphic grade. Uncleaved Welsh mudrocks of the diagenetic zone yield Sm-Nd leachate-residue ages of 453-484 Ma, in agreement with their Llanviian to Caradocian biostratigraphic ages, whereas higher grade rocks of the anchizone and epizone yield Sm-Nd ages as young as 413 Ma. These ages are transitional between the time of deposition and the time of regional deformation related to the Acadian Orogeny at 390 Ma. Distinct convex-upward rare earth element (REE) patterns of the leachates suggest that the precipitation of early diagenetic apatite controls the trace element budget of the rock, forcing a depletion of middle REEs on the subsequently formed diagenetic phyllosilicates. The amount of organic matter present and the extent of later prograde reactions are probable modifiers of this fractionation process. Ordovician and Devonian clastic rocks associated with the Trenton and Onondaga limestones of New York yield single-sample and multi-sample Sm-Nd isochron ages that agree well with their biostratigraphic ages of 454 Ma and 390 Ma, respectively. The REE fractionation observed in shale leachates of the Ordovician Utica Formation is related to Ca/Mg of the bulk rock and hence to the composition of the diagenetic carbonate cement. In all cases the Sm-Nd system remained closed subsequent to the peak of diagenesis or metamorphism, including the North American rocks that show no evidence of being isotopically reset during widespread remagnetization of the subjacent limestone units in the late Paleozoic. © 1994.",,"age determination; argillaceous sediment; diagenesis; fractionation; low grade metamorphism; Palaeozoic; REE",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028192225

Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations indicate that each excited state pathway connects both the s-cis and s-trans excited state equilibrium structures of 2, 3-DMB and 2-CNB to a conical intersection of the ground and excited state. The geometry of the lowest energy conical intersection points have been fully optimized. The conical intersections provide ultrafast radiationless decay channels and thus are a central feature in the mechanism of butadiene photolysis. The excited state reaction paths of the model (butadiene) and substituted systems involve a similar reaction “coordinate corresponding to the deformation of the butadiene moiety by out-of-plane motion of the carbon framework coupled with asynchronous rotation of the terminal methylenes. The comparison of the excited state pathways for parent and substituted butadienes provides a basis for the rationalization of the dramatic substituent effects observed in the photoproduct quantum yield ratio of 2, 3-DMB and 2-CNB. The result supports the idea that substituents mainly affect the nature of the ground-state relaxation occurring just after the decay. However, this effect is intimately related to the particular structure and dynamics that the photoexcited reactant acquires during its excited-state lifetime.© 1994, American Chemical Society.

The relationships between the many aspects of energy in a societal context and climate/weather are becoming increasingly evident. Energy is one of the driving forces in socio-economic development. Many forms of energy are using climate as a resource, especially new and renewable forms of energy, such as solar and wind energy. Production and use of energy has a complex impact on the environment, including an impact on climate and the need for energy is normally directly related to climate and weather. Formally this is reflected in such documents as the WMO Long-term Plan where the following objectives of the World Climate Programme have been formulated: 1. (i) To facilitate the effective collection and management of climate data and the monitoring of the global climate system, including the detection and assessment of climate variability and changes; 2. (ii) To foster the effective application of climate knowledge and information for the benefit of society and the provision of climate services, including the prediction of significant climate variations both natural and as a result of human activity; 3. (iii) To assess the impacts of climate variability and changes that could markedly affect economic or social activities and advise governments thereon, and contribute to the development of a range of socio-economic response strategies that could be used by governments and the community; 4. (iv) To improve the understanding of climate processes for determining the predictability of climate, including its variability and change, identifying the extent of human influence on climate and developing the capability for climate prediction. The Main Long-term Objectives of the World Climate Applications and Services Programme are: 1. (i) To help Members in developing services based on the application of climate information and knowledge for national sustainable development with emphasis on methods of adaptation to, and mitigation of, adverse impacts of climate and its variations; 2. (ii) To promote awareness of the potential benefits of the applications of climatic information and knowledge in human endeavour and the provision of climate services; 3. (iii)To provide easy access to practical techniques for applications of climate information and knowledge:. WMO activities in the energy area during the decade 1992-2001 will include: 1. (i) the further evaluation of weather and climate implications in energy matters, 2. (ii) assessment of the effects of climate and climate change on the energy sector and 3. (iii) facilitating practical applications of meteorological and hydrological information and related methodologies in various areas of energy conservation, production and distribution. WMO is pursuing some of these objectives by supporting the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) for the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). In following up the results of the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) focus is on Agenda 21. In the now ratified FCCC reference is made to energy, promotion and sustainable management and conservation of resources as well as to the need for adaptation. In particular it is stated that ""the developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in Annex II (to the FCCC) shall take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly developing country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention"". The Conference of the Parties to the FCCC will meet for the first time early in 1995 and one of its tasks, in the years ahead, will be to guide the implementation of the Convention. The Senior Expert Symposium on Electricity and Environment, which was held in Helsinki in May 1991 initiated a Joint (Inter-Agency) Project on Databases and Methodologies for Comparative Assessment of Different Energy Sources for Electricity Generation (DECADES). It is important that the best available information are made available to this project in order to assure compatibility of the data for the different energy sources. On issues relating to Energy and Environment, as well as to development and use of new and renewable sources of energy, WMO continues to assume the role as the authoritative scientific voice in matters relating to the atmosphere, water and climate in the world arena. © 1994.",,"Climatology; Energy management; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Hydrology; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; New and renewable sources of energy (NRSE); Sustainable energy systems; World Meteorological Organization (WMO); Energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028481171

We first extend reservoir theory by quantifying the difference between turnover time and transit time (or residence time) for time‐dependent systems under any mixing conditions. We explicitly demonstrate the errors which result from assuming these timescales are equal, which is only true at steady state. We also derive a new response function which allows the calculation of age distributions and timescales for well‐mixed reservoirs away from steady state, and differentiate between timescales based on gross and net fluxes. These theoretical results are particularly important to tracer‐calibrated “box models” currently used to study the carbon cycle, which usually approximate reservoirs as well‐mixed. We then apply the results to the important case of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere, since timescales describing its behavior are commonly used but ambiguously defined. All relevant timescales, including lifetime, transit time, and adjustment time, are precisely defined and calculated from data and models. Apparent discrepancies between the current, empirically determined turnover time of 30–60 years and longer model‐derived estimates of expected lifetime and adjustment time are explained within this theoretical framework. We also discuss the results in light of policy issues related to global warming, in particular since any comparisons of the “lifetimes” of different greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC's, etc.) must use a consistent definition to be meaningful.

These predictions are compared with stored soil water within well field regions and serve as a basis for managing groundwater resources. Soil water measurement errors, variable recharge, unpredictable climatic conditions affecting plant water use, and modeling errors make soil water predictions uncertain and error-prone. We developed and tested a scheme based on soil water balance coupled with implementation of Kalman filtering (KF) for (1) providing physically based soil water storage predictions with prediction errors projected from the statistics of the various inputs, and (2) reducing the overall uncertainty in both estimates and predictions. The proposed KF-based scheme was tested using experimental data collected at a location on the Owens Valley floor where the water table was artificially lowered by groundwater pumping and later allowed to recover. Vegetation composition and per cent cover, climatic data, and soil water information were collected and used for developing a soil water balance. Predictions and updates of soil water storage under different types of vegetation were obtained for a period of 5 years. The main results show that: (1) the proposed predictive model provides reliable and resilient soil water estimates under a wide range of external conditions; (2) the predicted soil water storage and the error bounds provided by the model offer a realistic and rational basis for decisions such as when to curtail well field operation to ensure plant survival. The predictive model offers a practical means for accommodating simple aspects of spatial variability by considering the additional source of uncertainty as part of modeling or measurement uncertainty. © 1994.",,"Groundwater; Soils; Vegetation; available soil water; groundwater management; plant water use; soil water storage; water table fluctuation; USA, California, Owens Valley; Climatology; Data acquisition; Groundwater; Kalman filtering; Mathematical models; Measurement errors; Plants (botany); Recharging (underground waters); Statistics; Soil water storage; Water table depths; Hydrology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028670003

While both CO and HC emissions have been curtailed further and require novel emission technologies, the latter takes on a higher priority due to drastic reduction imposed by ULEV regulations. In current emission control systems with three-way catalysts, the major part of these emissions is created during cold start and warm-up phases when the catalyst temperature is below its light-off temperature. The present paper reports on burner/catalyst systems for improving the catalyst's cold start performance, which is a novel technology compared to other known technologies such as electrically heated catalysts (EHC) and adsorbers. The burner system heats up the catalyst rapidly to its light-off temperature and reduces the cold start emissions without a noticeable fuel penalty. The present paper describes the current state of development of this burner/catalyst system. It provides conversion data obtained from vehicles of Volkswagen Group and suggests additional improvements to reduce cold start emissions further. THE THREE-WAY catalyst, which is used in large-volume production, permits a reduction of exhaust emissions by approximately 90%. The ULEV standard for NMOG of 0.04 g/mi requires another reduction of about the same percentage. This cannot be achieved with the current technology. More than 80% of the HC and CO emissions are generated during the first few minutes after cold start since the catalyst has not reached its light-off temperature. During this phase it is especially the HC emissions that have to be reduced drastically. The adsorber technology [1]* and the EHC system [2, 3, 4, 5 and 6] are two of the viable solutions to combating cold start emissions. The burner/catalyst system, developed by Pierburg and Volkswagen, is a third viable approach to achieve this goal. Initial results for the burner/catalyst system have been published recently [7]. In the meantime many automotive manufacturers are engaged in similar development projects [8].

The analysis suggested that taxa are distributed along topographic/moisture gradients, with two broad syntaxonomic classes differentiated from one another by substratum. If the patterns of species turnover on the two major substrata (sandstone and dolerite) differ significantly, taxa may be responding to environmental stresses other than elevation and rainfall. The null hypothesis being that if the two substrata parallel one another along a topographic/moisture gradient, the species replacement rates should be similar. The null hypothesis was rejected as species replacement rates on sandstone at high rainfall and high elevation are higher than on dolerite at comparable environmental conditions. The differences are attributable to species-poor degraded sites in topo-moisture class C (1200-1300 m elevation and 300-350mm median annual rainfall). The topo-moisture class has a high coefficient of variation in mean annual rainfall. Topo-moisture class C on sandstone pediments supports a degraded flora. The high entropy of the samples suggests that the flora is well-adapted to coping with the climatic uncertainty of this region. There does not appear to be an encroaching karoo front, but rather a flora of generalist species which are successful at coping with the high coefficient of variation in precipitation. It is suggested that if environmental conditions change due to global warming, the intruding front will only extend into areas of increased climatic uncertainty. Pastoral management strategies which increase environmental uncertainty should also be discouraged. © 1994 Academic Press Limited.",,"dwarf shrubland; grassland; moisture gradient; species turnover; topographic gradient; South Africa, Karoo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028161579

Research Institute, Department Emissions Air Pollution, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK 4000 Roskilde, Denmark","The Danish air pollution abatement is based by and large on emission control. Since the ratification of the international sulfur protocol of 1985, there has been a continuous tightening of the permissible sulfur content in fuels and of the maximum emissions from power plants. As a consequence, the total annual emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) has been reduced from 450,000 tons in the seventies to 180,000 tons in 1990. This has had a pronounced effect on the SO2 levels in Danish urban areas. Thus, in Copenhagen, the yearly averages have fallen to about 25%. For nitrogen oxides emitted from the power plants, similar regulations are in force. With this legislation, the most important and crucial source of air pollution in Danish urban areas is road traffic. The contribution of nitrogen oxides from national traffic accounts for nearly half the total Danish emission and is increasing steadily; this is consistent with an observed increase of nitrogen oxides in ambient air. The permissible levels of lead in petrol has been reduced drastically. After an introduction of reduced tax on lead-free petrol, it now accounts for more than two-thirds of the total consumption. As a result, the concentration of lead in urban ambient air has been reduced to less than one-sixth. The introduction of 3-way catalytic converters from October 1990 will result in reductions in the emission of a series of pollutants, e.g., lead, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. In 1980, a Danish air quality monitoring program was established as a cooperative effort between the authorities, the Government, the counties, the municipalities, and the Greater Copenhagen Council. Subsequently, the program has been revised with greater emphasis on air pollution from traffic. The network now includes monitoring of gasses and particulates, generally at curb side. The effects of planned traffic regulations and measures taken are evaluated by use of air quality models. Only a few studies of the relations between air pollution and health have been carried out in Denmark, but even the fairly modest levels appear to have some impact on sensitive groups, e.g., children and asthmatics.","Air pollution; Air quality; Emissions; Health effects; Monitoring; Nitrogenoxides; Sulfur dioxide lead","carbon monoxide; fuel; gasoline; lead; nitrogen oxide; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; asthma; conference paper; Denmark; electric power plant; government; health; human; law; maximum allowable concentration; particulate matter; pollution control; priority journal; tax; traffic; urban area",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028036608

Fast transients of light/dark-dependent CO2 uptake and release were measured in order to screen for the presence or absence of a photosynthetic CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) within the photobiont. It was found that lichens with Trebouxia photobionts (four species) were able to accumulate a small pool of inorganic carbon (DIC; 70-140 nmol per mg chlorophyll (Chl)), in the light, which theoretically may result in, at least, a two to threefold increase in the stromal CO2 concentration, as compared to that in equilibrium with ambient air. The other lichens (four species), which were tripartite associations between a fungus, a cyanobacterium (Nostoc) and a green alga (Coccomyxa or Dictyochloropsis) accumulated a much smaller pool of DIC (10-30 nmol·(mg Chl)-1). This pool is most probably associated with the previously documented CCM of Nostoc, inferred from the finding that free-living cells of Coccomyxa did not show any signs of DIC accumulation. In addition, the kinetics of fast CO2 exchange for free-living Nostoc were similar to those of intact tripartite lichens, especially in their responses to the CCM and the carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor ethoxyzolamide. Trebouxia lichens had a higher photosynthetic capacity at low and limiting external CO2 concentrations, with an initial slope of the CO2-response curve of 2.6-3.9 μmol·(mg Chl)-1·h-1·Pa-1, compared to the tripartite lichens which had an initial slope of 0.5-1.1 μmol-(mg Chl)-1·h-1·-Pa-1, suggesting that the presence of a CCM in the photobiont affects the photosynthetic performance of the whole lichen. Regardless of these indications for the presence or absence of a CCM, ethoxyzolamide inhibited the steady-state rate of photosynthesis at low CO2 in all lichens, indicating a role of CA in the photosynthetic process within all of the photobionts. Measurements of CA activity in photobiont-enriched homogenates of the lichens showed that Coccomyxa had by far the highest activity, while the other photobionts displayed only traces or no activity at all. As the CCM is apparently absent in Coccomyxa, it is speculated that this alga compensates for this absence with high internal CA activity, which may function to reduce the CO2-diffusion resistance through the cell. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Alga (green); Carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism; Carbonic anhydrase; Cyanobacterium; Lichen; Photosynthesis (alga, lichen)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028247901

Assuming an asymmetric triangular density distribution of periodically oriented circular dislocation loops provides an efficient model reflecting the nonuniform morphology of the loops as observed in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments. The effective pressure from the ensemble of dislocation loops is numerically calculated on the basis of the established formulation of pressure from a single circular loop. The pressure field from the layer of dislocation loops is fundamental to the modeling, as it largely affects equilibrium point defect concentrations and boundary conditions governing emission and absorption of the point defects. Solving the pressure-dependent point defect diffusion equations in association with the simplified loop distribution and geometry makes it possible to model the loop growth and shrinkage incorporating effectively the statistical processes such as loop coalescence and dissolution during oxidation. The simulation with the model shows reduced interstitial supersaturation during the oxidation and correctly predicts the variation of the number of captured silicon atoms and the radii and densities of the dislocation loops in agreement with the TEM experiments. © 1994, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

It has been suggested that photoexcitation of O2‡ in the O 2 Schumann-Runge bands will lead to predissociation, and autocatalytic production of O3. The resultant new source of atmospheric O3 could help alleviate current discrepancies between observed and modeled O3 profiles. To evaluate this possibility, we have examined two critical factors - the nascent distribution of of O 2‡ levels for 248 nm photodissociation, near the peak of the Hartley band, and the rate coefficients for their relaxation by O2 and N2. We find that the distribution extends to v=22, close to the thermodynamic limit, with a peak near v=8. The 300 K quenching rate coefficients have been evaluated using a cascade model, in which it is assumed that relaxation by O2 occurs through single-quantum vibration-vibration (V-V) and vibration-translation (V-T) steps. By modeling the relaxation from the top of the distribution downwards, we simultaneously obtain both the quenching rate coefficients and the nascent vibrational distribution. Agreement with new rate coefficient measurements carried out in a state-specific manner is good, as is also true for the comparison with new V-V and V-T calculations. Data from experiments on O2‡ quenching by N2 show that in the v= 16-22 range, potentially important in the atmosphere, quenching proceeds up to five times faster than for the case of O2. The hypothesized explanation is that two-quantum V-V transfer, peaking at the resonant condition of O2(v= 18-19), is the dominant process. As a consequence, atmospheric quenching of O2‡ for levels above v=14 is basically controlled by N2, and at low stratospheric temperatures, the effect of N2 quenching near v=18 is likely to be 2 orders of magnitude greater than quenching by O2. This unexpected effect probably precludes a significant role for O2‡ photodissociation as a new source of stratospheric O3, but the existence of these high-energy entities can have other consequences, among them being enhanced activity with minor species, and the possibility that energy may flow from the relatively stable O2(v=1) and N2(v=1) levels into infrared-active H2O and CO2, respectively. Measurements have also been made for O2‡ quenching by O 3, CO2, and He, particularly to establish whether O 3 and CO2 can play a competitive quenching role in the atmosphere. Although O3 is a fast quencher, with CO2 being 2 orders of magnitude slower, they are unlikely to compete with O2 and N2. The data on He is particularly interesting, suggesting that considerably more O2‡ is present in the nascent O3 photodissociation products than subsequently appears from O(1D) +O3 interaction. The implications of this finding are discussed. © 1994 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001418688

In the growth using AsH3 and TMG, three different regions of growth rates were observed with respect to the growth temperature, which is similar to that observed in the conventional CBE or metalorganic molecular beam epitaxy (MOMBE). The growth rates by AsH3 and TEG, however, produced an anomalous dependence on the growth temperature revealing two humps. Hall measurement, photoluminescence, and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis data show that all films are p-type and the carbon concentration is greatly reduced compared to the epilayers grown by CBE which employs TMG and precracked arsine. It was also found that the uptake of carbon impurity is significantly reduced when TMG is replaced with TEG. Our results indicate that surface hydrogen atoms dissociated from arsine play an important role in removing hydrocarbon species from the growth surface. © 1994.",,"Arsenic compounds; Carbon; Epitaxial growth; Impurities; Organometallics; Photoluminescence; Chemical beam epitaxy; Metalorganic molecular beam epitaxy; Triethylgallium; Trimethylgallium; Unprecracked arsine; Semiconducting gallium arsenide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028383225

The OCC's effects were determined by measuring and comparing selected raw exhaust emissions with and without the platinum-based OCC installed in the exhaust system, with the engine operated at three steady-state modes. It was found that the OCC had no significant effect on oxides of nitrogen (NO X) and nitric oxide (NO) at any mode, but reduced hydrocarbon (HC) emmissions by 60 to 70 percent. The OCC reduced total particulate matter (TPM) levels by 27 to 54 percent, primarily resulting from 53 to 71 percent reductions of the soluble organic fraction (SOF). The OCC increased sulfate (SO 42-) levels at two of the three modes (modes 9 and 10), but the overall SO42- contribution to TPM was less than 6 percent at all modes due to the low sulfur level of the fuel. The solids fraction (SOL) was not significantly affected by the OCC at any mode. Vapor phase organics (termed XOC) were decreased by 56 to 68 percent. The particle size distributions with the OCC were similar to those under baseline conditions, with virtually no change in either the nuclei or the accumulation mode. The OCC generally reduced the measured polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) associated with the SOF and XOC. Some nitro-PAH levels (e.g., particle-associated 1,6-DNP) were lower when the OCC was used, but due to higher variability in the data (compared to the PAH data), statistical-based comparisons were not conducted. The OCC generally increased the mutagenic activity per mass of the SOF and XOC; however, for all but one case, these increases were offset by the decreases in the SOF and XOC levels. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Catalytic converters; Catalytic oxidation; Diesel engines; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Nitric oxide; Particle size; Sols; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Accumulation modes; Base-line conditions; Mutagenic activity; Oxides of nitrogen; Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons; Soluble organic fraction; Total particulate matter; Unregulated emissions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072435543

Patients and Methods: Sixteen patients with completely resected, CEA-producing colorectal cancer were given 1 mg of 99mTc-labeled IMMU-4 intravenously with no toxic side effects. Planar and single-photon emission CT (SPECT) scans were acquired at 6 hours. Fifteen patients underwent an exploratory laparotomy at 24 hours. Results of the scintigraphy were correlated with surgical findings. Results: Twelve of 15 patients (80%) had true-positive (TP) scans when correlated with surgery. Two of 15 (13%) had true-negative (TN) scans inasmuch as exploratory laparotomy failed to detect recurrent disease. A false-positive (FP) scan was obtained in one of 15 (7%). There were no false- negative (FN) scans. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the positive predictive value (PPV) were 100%, 67%, 93%, and 92%, respectively. Twenty- six histologically confirmed areas of malignancy were found and correlated with areas of increased activity seen on IMMU-4 scintigraphy. Twenty-one were TP; five were not detected by scintigraphy and were thus considered to be FN. There were five FP lesions and 25 TN regions.

The code has been updated with state-of-the-art submodels including: a wave breakup atomization model, drop drag with drop distortion, spray/wall interaction with sliding, rebounding, and breaking-up drops, multistep kinetics ignition and laminar-turbulent characteristic time combustion, wall heat transfer with unsteadiness and compressibility, Zeldovich NOx formation, and soot formation with Nagle Strickland-Constable oxidation. The computational results are compared with experimental data from a single-cylinder Caterpillar research engine equipped with a high-pressure, electronically-controlled fuel injection system, a full-dilution tunnel for soot measurements, and gaseous emissions instrumentation. The results show the use of the updated version of KIVA gives good agreement between measured and predicted engine cylinder pressures and heat release data for single injection cases. This level of agreement was found to be necessary so that the predicted and measured soot and NOx emissions trends would also agree well. Soot and NOx emissions were also found to be very sensitive to factors that influence the chamber gas temperatures such as crevice flow. The results show that the combustion is controlled by the details of the spray model. In particular, drop breakup and drop drag effects govern the penetration and mixing of vaporizing sprays under diesel engine conditions. The effects of spray-wall impingement were also found to be important. Consistent with measured data, computations showed that soot and NOx emissions increase at low injection pressures. Predictions made with ultra-high injection pressures suggest that there is a limit to the usefulness of high injection pressures for NOx emissions reduction. Good agreement with measured data was also found for split injections with relatively short dwells between injections. For split injections with larger dwell, the agreement deteriorated, indicating that refinements in spray, ignition and combustion models are still needed. Consistent with experiments, the computations show that split injections have a significant effect on the overall rate of pressure rise. The good agreement between experiments and model predictions indicates that computer models are now available for use by the engine industry to provide directions for engine design and to gain insight into in-cylinder events. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Diesel engines; Drag; Drops; Dust; Emission control; Engine cylinders; Fuel injection; Heat transfer; Ignition; Machine design; Nitrogen oxides; Soot; Computational results; Diesel engine performance; Fuel injection characteristics; Fuel injection systems; High injection pressures; Low injection pressure; Spray wall impingement; Turbulent characteristics; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072412213

MMOH contains two oxygen-bridged dinuclear iron clusters that are the sites of O2 activation and hydrocarbon oxidation. Each cluster can be stabilized in diferric [Fe(III)·Fe(III)], mixed-valence [Fe(II)·Fe(III)], and diferrous [Fe(II)·Fe(II)] redox states. We have correlated the EPR spin quantitation of the S = ½ mixed-valence state with the system electrode potential to determine both formal redox potential values for MMOH at 4 °C: E1°′ = +76 ± 15 mV and E2°′ = +21 ± 15 mV (Em = +48 mV, 61% maximum mixed-valence state). Complementary Mössbauer studies of 57Fe-enriched MMOH allowed all three redox states to be quantitated simultaneously in individual samples and revealed that the distribution of redox states was in accord with the measured potential values. EPR spectra of partially reduced MMOH showed that the apparent midpoint potential values of MMOH-MMOR, MMOH-MMOR-MMOB, and MMOH-MMOR-MMOB-substrate complexes were slightly more positive than that of MMOH alone. In contrast, the MMOH-MMOB complex appeared to have a substantially more negative redox potential. The formal redox potential values of the latter complex were determined to be E1°′ = −52 ± 15 mV and E2°′ = −115 ± 15 mV, respectively, at 4 °C (Em = −84 mV, 65% maximum mixed-valence state). This negative 132-mV shift in the midpoint potential of MMOH coupled to MMOB binding suggests that MMOB binds ≈104 more strongly to the diferric state of MMOH than to the diferrous state. Since the potential shift is strongly negative, and since a nearly constant separation between the two formal potential values of MMOH is maintained when MMOB binds, the role of the MMOB-MMOH complex must not be to thermodynamically stabilize the formation of the diferrous cluster which is the form that reacts with O2 during catalysis. However, MMOB binding may provide kinetic stabilization of the diferrous state and/or modulation of the interaction of MMOH with O2 and hydrocarbon substrates. Such roles may be effected through cyclic association and dissociation of the MMOB-MMOH complex as MMOH oscillates between redox states during catalysis, thereby dynamically altering the affinity of this complex. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

Alignment of SPECT and CT images was performed using marked anatomical features and the anterior and lateral skin outlines. CT images provided data for attenuation correction and were used to define the anatomical lung volume.

As long as contents of heavy metals and known organic compounds are kept below accepted limit values, such waste oducts can be regarded as valuable nutrient resources, and particularly when the vegetation is produced for energy purposes instead of for direct or indirect human consumption. The benefit is three-fold: (i) purification of municipal waste using natural circulation, (ii) production of biomass for energy purposes, (iii) reduction of air pollution when burning wood instead of fossil fuels. Most Salix plantations can be used as recipients of sludge and ash as well as be irrigated with wastewater from sewage plants or with leakage water from dumps. Regarding waste and leakage water irrigation, a combined artificial wetland for winter conditions and a willow vegetation filter during the growing season can be used for the purification The welland should be planted with a suitable vegetation cover, which can be harvested in order to remove maximal amounts of nutrients from the system. This biomass can be used as fuel or in compost. There are also indications that some willow clones are capable of taking up certain heavy metals, while others are not.

According to a well-accepted rule, cytosine methylation is confined to symmetrical sequences such as CpG and CpNpG, which provide the signal for faithful transmission of symmetrical methylation patterns by maintenance methylase. Using a genomic sequencing technique, we have analysed cytosine methylation patterns within a hypermethylated and a hypomethylated state of a transgene in Petunia hybrida. Examination of a part of the transgene promoter revealed that in both states m5C residues located within non-symmetrical sequences could be detected. Non-symmetrical C residues in the two states were methylated at frequencies of 5.9 and 31.9%, respectively. Methylation appeared to be distributed heterogeneously, but some DNA regions were more intensively methylated than others.

The fossil samples come from the sites of Elandsfontein (Cape Province) and Florisbad (Orange Free State) in South Africa. On the basis of differences in skull morphology and size of the appendicular skeleton between fossil and modern black wildebeest (Connochaetes gnou), the subspecies name antiquus, proposed earlier to designate the Pleistocene form, can be retained. The same taxonomic level is accepted for the large Pleistocene eland, which could be named Taurotragus oryx antiquus. The long horned or giant buffalo, Pelorovis antiquus, can be included in the polymorphous Syncerus caffer stock and could therefore be called Syncerus caffer antiquus . The ecology of Pleistocene and modern Connochaetes, Taurotragus and Syncerus is discussed. A relationship between herbivore body size and climate, as Bergmann's Rule predicts, could not be demonstrated. This study furthermore questions the significance of body size and horn core morphology for Pleistocene ungulate taxonomy and suggests that the number of known (late) Quaternary species extinctions in sub-Saharan Africa may be overrated. Phyletic change is considered an alternative possibility and agonistic behaviour invoked as one of the mechanisms to explain the evolutionary shift from the Pleistocene populations of Connochaetes, Taurotragus and Syncerus to modern black wildebeest, eland and African buffalo in sub-Saharan Africa. © 1994 Academic Press.

When the O2 level was increased from 14 to 213 mbars at high irradiance, ΦII increased by as much as 115% in P. bisulcatum but by no more than 17% in P. antidotale. Under the same conditions ΦII increased to an intermediate degree in P. milioides. Measurements of accumulation of the photooxidized form of the photosystem I reaction center (P700+) based on the light-dependent in vivo absorbance change at 830 nm indicate that the steady-state concentration of P700+ varied in an antiparallel manner with ΦII when either the irradiance or O2 concentration was changed. Hence, O2-dependent changes in ΦII, were indicative of variations in linear photosynthetic electron transport. These experiments revealed, however, that a significant capacity was retained for in vivo regulation of the apparent quantum yield of photosystem I (ΦI) independently of ΦII. Coordinate regulation of quantum yields of photosystems I and II (expressed as ΦI:ΦII) in response to changing irradiance and O2 level differed markedly for the C3 and C4 species, and the response for the C3-C4 species most closely resembled that observed for the C4 species. The fraction of total linear electron transport supporting photorespiration at 213 mbars of O2 was negligible in the C4 species and was 13% lower in the C3-C4 species relative to the C3 species as calculated from fluorescence and gas-exchange determinations. At high photon-flux rates and high O2 concentration, the potential benefit to light use for net CO2 uptake arising from lower photorespiration in P. milioides was offset by a reduced capacity for total CO2- and O2-dependent noncyclic electron transport in this species compared with P. bisulcatum.",,"Panicum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027977613

Effects of these changes on plants have usually been examined in controlled-environment enclosures, glass-houses, or open-top field chambers. Beginning in 1989, an innovative experimental free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) facility was operated in central Arizona to evaluate crop response to increased CO2 levels within a large, open-field production environment. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) was grown for three consecutive seasons under well-watered conditions and exposed to either ambient (control, about 370 μmol mol-1) or elevated (FACE, 550 μmol mol-1) CO2 concentrations. Deficit irrigation regimes supplying 75% (beginning in July 1990) or 67% (beginning in mid-May 1991) of the crop's evapotranspiration requirement were included as additional treatment variables. Plant growth was monitored by periodic sampling. Canopy reflectances in visible (blue, 0.45-0.52 μm; green, 0.50-0.59 μm; red, 0.61-0.68 μm) and near-infrared (NIR; 0.79-0.89 μm) wavebands were measured frequently with an Exotech radiometer and related to absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 0.4-0.7 μm) measured with a line quantum sensor. Dry biomass of plants in the FACE treatment was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) greater than control values during each year of the study. The FACE plant canopy also absorbed significantly more PAR than controls during the early and middle portion of the 1990 and 1991 seasons. Light use efficiency (LUE, biomass produced per unit absorbed PAR) was significantly higher in FACE plots during each year. In the well-watered irrigation treatment, the 3 year mean LUE was 1.97 g MJ-1 for FACE and 1.56 g MJ-1 for controls. The deficit irrigation treatment in 1991 produced significantly smaller plants, which absorbed less PAR and had lower LUE than plants in the well-watered treatment (P &lt; 0.05). No interaction was observed between CO2 and irrigation treatments. FACE research under realistic field conditions revealed positive consequences of increased CO2 on cotton plant biomass, PAR absorption, and LUE. It also demonstrated the effectiveness of this new technology for examining community-level plant responses to possible changes in global environment. © 1994.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000027762

In the case of ENR, thermal oxidation occurs not only in the double bond region, but also involves epoxide ring-opening reaction to yield oxidative products having similar functional groups as that of SMR L. For the three rubbers studied, increasing temperature of thermal oxidation increases the rate of oxidation. From a time-dependent study, it suggests that thermal oxidation of ENR is an autocatalytic process. No attempt, however, is made to ascertain the exact chemical structures of the oxidative products formed in this study. © 1994.",,"Catalysis; Chemical modification; Degradation; Infrared spectroscopy; Molecular structure; Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Spectrum analysis; Thermal effects; Epoxidized natural rubber; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR); Thermal oxidation; Rubber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028193229

Sea‐ice dynamics is modelled using the cavitating‐fluid method of Flato and Hibler (1990, 1992). The atmospheric general circulation model originated from the NCAR Community Climate Model version 1, but is heavily modified to include new treatments of clouds, penetrative convection, planetary boundary‐layer mixing, solar radiation, the diurnal cycle and the semi‐Lagrangian transport of water vapour. The surface models include an explicit model of vegetation (similar to BATS and SiB), multilayer models of soil, snow and sea ice, and a slab ocean mixed layer.When sea‐ice dynamics is turned off, the CO2‐induced warming increases drastically around ∼60–80°S in winter and spring. This is due to the much greater (and unrealistic) compactness of the Antarctic ice cover without dynamics, which is reduced considerably when CO2 is doubled and exposes more open ocean to the atmosphere. With dynamics, the winter ice is already quite dispersed for 1 × CO2 so that its compactness does not decrease as much when CO2 is doubled. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide doubling; climate model; climate modelling; ice cover; ice dynamics; sea ice; sea-ice dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028591316

The industry recognizes the need to make substantial investments to maintain the environment for future generations. During the past 20 years, the oil industry has taken many steps to improve its environmental record and these have resulted in substantial reductions in the level of emissions arising from the manufacture and use of its products. During the 1980s, for example, the sulphur content of oil fuels was reduced by more than 60 per cent. The process of reducing emissions is still proceeding, with respect to initiatives within the industry and in response to pressures from outside, such as public concern at the quality of air in major cities which leads to proposals for legislative action. Thus it is that the oil industry is facing a string of proposals covering both operations and the quality of its products.

J. Biochem., 205 (1992) 1155), and the major forms CF-1, CF-5 and CM-2 were tested for their substrate specificity with dihydrodiol and quinone metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. CF-5, which was shown to correspond to aldehyde reductase in rabbit liver, was found to efficiently oxidize aromatic dihydrodiol metabolites (phenanthrene-1,2-dihydrodiol, benz[a]anthracene-3,4-dihydrodiol) while CF-1, corresponding to carbonyl reductase, and CM-2 were much less active. All three enzyme forms were found to reduce polycyclic K-region o-quinones of benz[a]anthracene, chrysene and benzo[a]pyrene. CF-1 was the least active, and CM-2 was the most active form with reaction velocities of > 10 μmol/min·mg protein.

The reduction of polycyclic o-quinones, but not of p-benzoquinone, by enzyme CM-2 was accompanied by the oxidation of large amounts of NADPH and the consumption of molecular oxygen which is indicative of a redox-cycling process. Thus, the formation of catechol metabolites from dihydrodiols and o-quinones may be catalyzed by the same enzymes in rabbit liver, and the reaction rate of the enzymatic reduction is strongly dependent on the structural type of the polycyclic quinone. © 1994.","Carcinogenicity; Dihydrodiol; Dihydrodiol dehydrogenase; Metabolism; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Quinone","oxidoreductase; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; quinone derivative; animal tissue; article; biotransformation; controlled study; liver; male; nonhuman; rabbit; reduction; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Animal; Carcinogens; In Vitro; Isoenzymes; Liver; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen Consumption; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons; Quinones; Rabbits; Substrate Specificity; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028197089

Se examinó la posible relación entre esta súbita disminución y las condiciones cálidas y secas de 1987. Para analizar los patrones locales de tiempo, se definió un ciclo de temperatura‐humedad de 12 meses (julio–junio) que consiste de cuatro períodos: (1) últimos meses de la estación lluviosa; (2) transición a la estación seca; (3) estación seca; y (4) recuperación después de la estación seca (principio de la estación lluviosa). El ciclo de 1986–1987 fue el único registrado (de 20 analizodos) que recibió precipitación anormalmente baja en todos los cuatro períodos, y las anomalías de temperaturas en 1987 fueron las más altas registradas. Los caudales en las quebradas locales que se alimentan de manantiales fueron los más bajos registrados durante la estación seca y el período de recuperación. Este trastorno del clima, asociado con El Niño/Oscilación del sur de 1986–1987, estuvo más severo que el evento parecido asociado con El Niño de 1982–1983, aunque esta oscilación anterior fue la más fuerte del último siglo. Datos para una población de ranas barlequines, recolectados durantes estos dos trastornos del clima, apoyan la hipótesis que en 1987, poco antes de que la población colapsara, las ranas cambiaron su distribución en el hábitat en respuesta a condiciones desecantes. La yuxtaposición de estos raros eventos demográficos sugieren que estuvieron ligados causalmente, pero dice poco de los mecanismos de la súbito disminución. Mientras que la desecación y los efectos directos de la temperatura pudieron haber causado mortalidad de adultos, también es posible que hubiera interacción entre las condiciones climáticas y otro factor. Se discuten dos hipótesis sobre una posible interacción: En la hipótesis de epidemia ligada al clima, los microparásitos son el factor adicional.

Some classes of physical model imply that surface uplift rates are too great to be accounted for by known rates of crustal thickening. If these rates could be confirmed important information on lower lithospheric and upper mantle processes could be derived. Moreover, the temporal development of surface heights in mountain belts and plateaux has been suggested to have important effects on global climates. Mean Annual Temperatures (MAT) can be estimated from a fossil flora using Wolfe's recently developed method of multivariate (correspondence) analysis of the physiognomy of angiosperm leaves, Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP). This technique is here applied to fossil floras in the Basin and Range province, western USA, a region which may have undergone a rapid height increase before extension began in Oligocene to Miocene time. Palaeoelevations, determined by comparing contemporaneous MAT data from floras deposited at sea level and from those in the continental interior, are estimated for two late Eocene floras in northeastern Nevada. Sea level data are derived from floras deposited in the Puget Group, Washington. One important source of uncertainty in estimating MAT using CLAMP, sample size, is evaluated here using the diverse Republic flora from Washington. These initial results suggest that in the late Eocene the elevation of northeastern Nevada was similar to that of today. However, the uncertainties inherent in using a small number of floras remain significant and to minimise these uncertainties additional floras of late Eocene, and also of Miocene age, from northeastern Nevada are being examined. © 1994.",,"angiosperm; elevation; palaeobotany; palaeoclimate; Tertiary; uplift rate; USA, Nevada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028193416

Initial experiences with the commonly implemented Nd:YAG Laser revealed stability drawbacks of output power as a consequence of the few watts which were necessary for LITT. In this study a diode laser at 850 nm with 0-5 W cw laser power was used. A fiber optic diffuser with distally closed catheter was refined and tested. From invitro experiments, induced coagulation diameters and the resulting time dependent temperature response were measured and compared for prostate, liver, and kidney tissue. In addition, the experimental results were compared with predictions from mathematical simulations based on measured optical tissue parameters. After 10 minutes of irradiation with 2 - 4.6 W CW laser power the temperature in the tissue had not reached steady state conditions. Increasing the power was more effective in achieving larger coagulation diameters than increasing the exposure time. In prostate and kidney tissue, temperatures after laser irradiation were found to be lower than in liver tissue, as a consequence of the larger optical penetration depth of the diode laser radiation and the specific water content. The laser treatment results in smaller coagulation diameters in prostate and kidney tissue but a higher threshold for carbonisation reducing the risk of damage the delivery system. In conclusion, for prostate and kidney tissue the diode laser at 850 nm is indicated for use in LITT. © 1994 SPIE.

Carbonates consist mainly of skeletal bryozoa hashes with variable amounts of intragranular CaCO3 cement. Minerals detected by XRD are mainly mixtures of low- to high-Mg calcites and quartz with variable amounts of aragonite. Four factors account for 95% of total variance of mineral components and elemental composition and are related to elements in carbonate fraction (factor 1), positive relationship between Mn and Mg with latitude (factor 2), to calcite types from D-spacing variation (factor 3) and to longitudinal (i.e. distance from coast) variation of carbonate and siliciclastic contents (factor 4). Factorial plots indicate residue/carbonate plane with elements associated with them and that Mg, Mn and aragonite contents and calcite D-spacings are related to latitude and vary with water temperatures. Ca values reflect variable amounts of carbonate. Mg content indicates water temperatures of &lt;10°C. Sr and Na are positively correlated and increase with both calcite and aragonite contents and the ratio of Sr Na is ∼ 1, unlike high ratios found in warm-water carbonates. Mn concentrations are higher than in warm shallow marine carbonates and similar range of Sr and Na contents in both calcite and aragonite may be due to the formation of impure phases of CaCO3. The δ18O and °13C values are positively correlated and tend to fall between the trend lines of seafoor diagenesis and upwelling water. Positive correlation between δ13C and Sr (and Na) is due to both calcite and aragonite contents or due to the occurrence of vaterite. The δ18O values of whole sediments indicate water temperature from 14 to 8°C (normal seawater) or 10-4°C (upwelling water). These temperatures are slightly higher than those obtained from δ18O of eastern Tasmanian brachiopods. Originally calcitic ancient carbonates are abundant in stratigraphic sequences and can be better understood by comparison with modern temperature calcitic carbonates rather than with aragonitic modern tropical carbonates. Many of these ancient originally calcitic carbonates are of non-tropical origin as coeval tropical aragonitic carbonates occur elsewhere. Low Sr Na ratios and high Mn contents are indicative of temperate origin. Heavy δ13C values can be used in calculating water temperatures. The non-tropical carbonates form at low CO2 levels in regions of upwelling waters, which maintain saturation of CaCO3 and provide nutrients for a luxuriant growth of fauna. © 1994.",,"aragonite; calcite; polar carbonate; shelf sediment; temperate carbonate; water temperature; Australia, Tasmania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028255742

With heavy input of mine and tailing water, the river sediments are enriched with heavy metals compared to the background sediments. Samples collected from the river bed have been analysed for Pb, Zn, Cu, Cd, Fe, Mn, Ca and Mg to recognise the extent of contamination and the geochemical process of dispersion. The river sediment is a mixture of natural erosional detritals, tailing discharges from the milling plant and hydrogenous precipitates. Besides the detrital carbonates derived from the dolomitic litho unit of the area, a significant amount of carbonate is likely to precipitate on the river bed due to influx of mine water. Correlation matrix and R-mode factor analyses revealed that coprecipitation of metals along with FeMn-hydroxides is significant. Association of metals with the precipitated carbonates is by adsorption under alkaline to neutral pH conditions. Cu has poor association with the other heavy metals but has a strong affinity with the gross lithology of the sediments (i.e. CaMg and FeMn in the second factor). The heavy-metal concentrations are extremely variable in the sediments and have been recognised by several approaches such as: (a) extraction at pH 3; (b) total dissolution of sediment samples for bulk heavy-metal analysis; and (c) sequential chemical extraction. Geochemical partitioning of Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd into exchangeable, carbonate, organic, multiple hydroxide and lithogenic pools (operationally defined by A. Tessier) has been brought out utilising a sequential chemical extraction scheme. Nondetrital carbonates are found to be the most efficient scavengers of Pb, Zn and Cd, whereas Cu goes for organics. The results emphasize the importance of the precipitated carbonates and organics as sinks for the heavy metals, even in presence of a high concentration of multiple hydroxides. Of all the metals, Cd appears to be the most mobile element and Zn has preferentially accumulated more in the sediments. The apparent mobility and potential bioavailability of the metals have been found to be in the order of Cd > Pb > Zn > Cu. © 1994.",,"bioavailability; contamination; heavy metal; milling; mining; stream sediment; India, Rajasthan, Zawar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028254798

In-place health promotion programs and organizational climate were also assessed using semi-structured interviews with key informants at the human service districts. Sixteen of the 17 districts had adopted smoking control policies (designated smoking areas) at the close of the program. A parallel tendency was observed for policy implementation and health promotion, i.e. generally the high-ranking districts for implementation also ranked high for health promotion. No linkages were noted for organizational climate. Follow up shows occupation-specific patterns that may indicate a need for stress reduction components in conjunction with cessation programs and/or worksite smoking control policies.

Carbonic anhydrase-II (CA-II), an enzyme important to osteoclast function, has been shown to be regulated by VD. We screened the promoter of chicken CA-II for VDR binding sites and identified a functional VDRE, between positions −1,203 and −1,187. Like the majority of the VDREs described to date, this response element consists of two directly repeated hexameric core binding motifs spaced by three nucleotides and is bound by a heterodimer formed by the VDR and the retinoid X receptor (RXR). We show that the polarity of the binding of this heterodimer is 5′-VDR-RXR-3′ in the CA-II VDRE, whereas on a “classical” DR3-type VDRE, such as that of the mouse osteopontin gene, this polarity is reversed to 5′-RXR-VDR-3′. We also show that the polarity of the heterodimeric complex in relation to the basic transcriptional machinery influences the sensitivity of the transcriptional activity to VD. This suggests that the orientation of a hormone response element in its natural promoter context constitutes an additional level of gene regulation. © 1994, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

The measured amplitude of X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) modulation is then an excellent probe of the local structural environment around the emitter atom in the near-surface substrate. The observed modulations are here compared to the results of single- and double-scattering cluster calculations with a fine agreement. Moreover, because of our choice of the emission plane and taking into account the similarity in the scattering factors of Ga and As atoms, XPD effects can be almost eliminated from the angular variation of the fractional peak ratio IAs (IAs + IGa) which is then easily related to the arsenic concentration profile CAs(z). A best-fitting procedure is used to select the experimental concentration depth profile which characterises the surface under study. Samples exposed to different technological treatments, like ion implantation, chemical etching and annealing have been studied and compared. The concentrations of As atoms at the surface for As-capped, MBE-grown (001) samples after annealing around 350°C and for chemically etched GaAs(001) wafers indicate the same type of surface (As-terminated) as far as composition and structure are concerned. © 1994.",,"Annealing; Arsenic; Atomic physics; Composition; Crystal structure; Electromagnetic wave scattering; Etching; Ion implantation; Molecular beam epitaxy; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Surfaces; X ray analysis; Angle resolved X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray photoelectron diffraction; Semiconducting gallium arsenide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028436631

These measurements are performed in the temperature range between 77 and 295 K using equivalent absorption pathlengths between 3.6 and 36 km. The collision-broadening data are measured for cases in which CH4, N2, H2 and He are the collision partners at total pressures ranging between 100 and 500 torr. The intensity results obtained here are the first such data to be reported for the 681.884 nm line. An analysis of the line intensity data based upon their dependence on temperature suggests that the rotational quantum number J assignable to this line is 2. The 681.884 nm line examined here is found to be approximately 7 times weaker at ambient temperature than the 619.68 nm line studied previously using the ILS technique. The work presented here, therefore, extends the limit of detection sensitivity for quantitative spectroscopic applications of ILS in congested spectral regions by almost an order of magnitude.

Three kinds of fully immersed gold electrodes have been used to study this phenomenon in molten lithium carbonate. Unless adequate precautions are taken such film formation is likely as demonstrated at gold/alumina disk electrodes designed and fabricated for determining the diffusion coefficient and concentration of oxygen species in molten carbonates. At a stationary electrode, film formation produces a spurious voltammetric peak cathodic of the normal peroxide reduction peak in lithium carbonate. This delayed peak, believed to be due to peroxide reduction in the film region, can complicate the interpretation of voltammetric data and lead to erroneous conclusions. At a rotating disk electrode, such film formation can prevent the development of a well-defined limiting current plateau, thereby limiting the usefulness of the electrode and preventing accurate determination of mass-transfer parameters. Such artifacts however, can be used to one's advantage as diagnostic criteria for recognizing film formation which in turn indicates unsatisfactory design or assembly of the disk electrode. © 1994, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

Carbonyl-hydroperoxides are the main cause of the negative temperature cofficient(NTC) in the transition region (600–650 K). At intermediate temperatures the equilibrium between alkyl and peroxy radicals shifts towards alkyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide becomes the dominant branching agent. At higher temperatures (T&lt; 1000K), decomposition reactions of alkyl radicals prevail on the direct oxidation and combustion process mainly proceeds through smaller olefins oxidation. As a consequence, only the low temperature, primary oxidation reactions of propane and butane need to be added to a comprehensive kinetic scheme already available for methane and C2species. The overall scheme discussed in this paper is constituted by more than 100 species involved in about 2000 reactions. Furthermore a new method of formalizing this large quantity of mechanistic rate data facilitates the application and the extension of this scheme. Several comparisons with experimental data, obtained over a wide range of temperatures (550–1200 K), pressures and oxygen concentrations, support and validate the proposed kinetic model. © 1994, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

On average, there has been a rise in sea levels around India over recent decades. Carbon emissions from the energy sector amount to 72 Tg a year, equivalent to all other sectors combined. A marginal net sequestration of 5.25 million tonnes of carbon occurred during 1986. Methane emissions from rice and livestock are estimated at 17.4 and 12.8 Tg/year, respectively. The accuracy of anthropogenic methane emissions estimates is debateable. India may experience a further rise in temperature of 1 C by the yr 2050. A modest increase in precipitation amounts might occur. Cereals production is estimated to decrease and the nutrition security of the region is likely to be hampered. About 70% of the electricity generation in India is from coal-based power stations. Altering this dependence significantly to reduce emissions would imply a substantial change in the present policy of the Indian government. The adoption of cleaner coal-technologies should be considered, as must the development of renewable, non-coventional energy sources. The scope for carbon sequestration is limited by land availability and other factors. It is argued that any response to global warming must be located firmly in the framework of sustainable development. -from Authors",,"agriculture; carbon emission; climate change; climate trend; developing country; emission control; energy consumption; energy efficiency; environmental implication; global warming; greenhouse gas emission; greenhouse gas emissions; land use; land use change; man-environment relations; sustainable development; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041145976

This gene is transcriptionally activated by thyroid hormone (T3) in normal erythrocytic cells. In this work we have analysed the molecular basis of the transcriptional control of the CAII gene by c-ErbA and v-ErbA. We show that several domains in the promoter control hormonal regulation of transcription. One domain proximal to the TATA box mediates T3 response but contains no identified binding site for c-ErbA. An other domain termed PAL2 is approximately 600 bp upstream the transcription initiation site and contains a c-ErbA binding site. We show that when it is associated to a heterologous promoter this site mediates transcriptional repression in erythrocytic cells but not in HeLa cells. Moreover, this site binds a nuclear erythrocyte-specific factor that we called NFX, which is different from cErbA. Heterodimers between c-ErbA and the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXR) compete with NFX for binding to PAL2. In contrast, v-ErbA alone or in association with RXR is a very poor competitor and is unable to chase NFX out of the PAL2 site. We propose that NFX is a transcription repressor whose activity is inhibited by c-ErbA but not v-ErbA. This mechanism might contribute to the overall regulation of the carbonic anhydrase II promoter. These data illustrate another possible mechanism through which v-ErbA might antagonize the function of c-ErbA in controlling gene expression.",,"carbonate dehydratase ii; liothyronine; animal cell; article; avian erythroblastosis oncovirus; binding competition; cell oncogene; chick embryo; controlled study; dna flanking region; erythroid cell; erythroleukemia cell; hela cell; hormonal regulation; human; human cell; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; repressor gene; tata box; transcription regulation; virus cell transformation; virus oncogene; Animal; Base Sequence; Binding, Competitive; Carbonic Anhydrases; Chick Embryo; Erythrocytes; Hela Cells; Human; Molecular Sequence Data; Nuclear Proteins; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Oncogene Proteins v-erbA; Osmosis; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Receptors, Retinoic Acid; Receptors, Thyroid Hormone; Repressor Proteins; Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Trans-Activation (Genetics); Transcription, Genetic; Transfection; Tretinoin; Triiodothyronine; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Animalia; Aves; Avian erythroblastosis virus; Oncovirinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028169331

Upto 15 LiP isozymes, ranging in Mr values from 38000 to 43000, are produced depending on culture conditions and strains employed. Manganese-dependent peroxidases (MnPs) are a second family of extracellular heme proteins produced by P. chrysosporium that are also believed to be important in lignin degradation by this organism. LiP and MnP production is seen during secondary metabolism and is completely suppressed under conditions of excess nitrogen and carbon. Excess Mn(II) in the medium, on the other hand, suppresses LiP production but enhances MnP production. Nitrogen regulation of LiP and MnP production is independent of carbon and Mn(II) regulation. LiP activity is also affected by idiophasic extracetlular proteases. Intracellular cAMP levels appear to be important in regulating the production of LiPs and MnPs, although LiP production is affected more than MnP production. Studies on the sequencing and characterization of lip cDNAs and genes of P. chrysosporium have shown that the major LiP isozymes are each encoded by a separate gene. Each lip gene encodes a mature protein that is 343-344 amino acids long, contains 1 putative N-glycosylation site, a number of putative O-glycosylation sites, and is preceded by a 27-28-amino acid leader peptide ending in a Lys-Arg cleavage site. The coding region of each lip gene is interrupted by 8-9 introns (50-63 bp), and the positions of the last two introns appear to be highly conserved. There are substantial differences in the temporal transcription patterns of the major lip genes. The sequence data suggest the presence of three lip gene subfamilies. The genomic DNA of P. chrysosporium strain BKMF-1767 was resolved into 10 chromosomes (genome size of 29 Mb), and that of strain ME-446 into 11 chromosomes (genome size of 32 Mb). The lip genes have been localized to five chromosomes in BKMF-1767 and to four chromosomes in ME-446.

All but three of the toxins studied still retained some affinity for their receptor site (IC50's in the range of 1-100 nM). Compound 7, having all three carbon-carbon double bonds reduced, is almost 3 orders of magnitude less strongly bound than 4, which has only two carboncarbon bonds reduced. This large effect resulting from H-ring reduction was unexpected, due to the similarity of this region of the molecule to the corresponding region of brevetoxin-A, which has a fully saturated eight-membered G-ring and is the most strongly bound toxin of those studied. Conformational analysis revealed that the unsaturated H-ring of brevetoxin B favors the boat-chair conformation as does the saturated G-ring of brevetoxin A. Upon reduction, the H-ring of brevetoxin B shifts to a crown conformation. This subtle change in conformational preference induces a significant change in the gross shape of the molecule, which we believe is responsible for the loss of binding affinity and toxicity. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

To study these phenomena and their interaction, the combustion of a packed bed in a stagnation point flow was modeled. As a first approach, the carbon-oxygen system was used as reaction system. The results show that the conductivity of the packed bed, its length and the oxygen content of the free flow have a decisive influence on the ignition and quench behavior of the heterogeneous reactions. The ignition of the gas phase reactions proceeds at much higher temperatures and thus can be taken from the calculations of the combustion of a non-porous wall because all oxygen is consumed at the surface of the packed bed. © 1994 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Early reports claim N2O to have no effect whereas recent findings demonstrate a cerebral cortical vasodilatation during N2O inhalation, but the regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the subcortical structures is unknown. Methods: Regional CBF was measured three-dimensionally with single photon emission computer-aided tomography after injection of xenon 133 in 8 spontaneously breathing men (mean age 29.6 yr) during normocapnia and hypocapnia with and without inhalation of 50% N2O. 8 isolated human pial arterial segments were mounted in organ baths. The segments were contracted with prostaglandin F(2α) and subjected to 30% oxygen and 5.6% carbon dioxide in nitrogen or N2O. Results: Normocapnic young men had a global CBF of 55 ± 4 ml · 100 g-1. Decreasing end-tidal CO2 tension by 1.3 kPa (9.3 mmHg) reduced CBF uniformly, with a decrease in global CBF to 45 ± 2 ml · 100 g-1 min-1 (P &lt; 0.0001). During normocapnia, inhalation of 50% N2O increased mean CBF to 67 ± 7 ml · 100 g-1 · min-1 (P &lt; 0.0001). Inhalation of 50% N2O during hypocapnia increased mean CBF to 63 ± 5 ml · 100 g-1 · min-1 (P &lt; 0.0001). During N2O inhalation there was no significant difference in mean CBF between normo- and hypocapnia. However, during hypocapnia, but not during normocapnia, N2O inhalation significantly changed the distribution of regional CBF (P &lt; 0.0001). Compared with hypocapnia without N2O, flow increased through the frontal (143%), parietal (140%) and temporal (133%) regions as well as through insula (151%), basal ganglia (145%) and thalamus (133%). In isolated human pial arteries, addition of N2O changed neither basal tension, nor the contraction elicited by prostaglandin F(2α). Conclusions: Inhalation of 50% N2O increased global CBF mainly by augmenting flow in frontal brain structures. In contrast, changes in carbon dioxide without N2O affected CBF uniformly in the brain. The uneven change in distribution of the CBF when N2O was added during hypocapnia, the reduced carbon dioxide response, and the lack of effect of N2O on isolated human pial arteries suggest that N2O may increase metabolism in selected brain areas.","Anesthetics, gases: nitrous oxide; Arteries: contractile response; pial; prostaglandin F(2α); Brain: cerebral blood flow; regional cerebral blood flow; Carbon dioxide: hypocapnia; normocapnia; Measurement techniques: single-photon-emission computer aided tomography","nitrous oxide; prostaglandin F2 alpha; adult; article; brain blood flow; brain circulation; brain cortex; controlled study; drug effect; drug metabolism; human; human experiment; hypocapnia; inhalational drug administration; male; normal human; photon emission tomography; pia artery; priority journal; vasodilatation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028081695

It includes a mathematical description of pollutant transport and transformation appropriate to the particular medium. Management models that address problems of water quality and those that address air quality have similar forms. The issues inherent in water quality management constitute classic forms in public sector problems. Efficiency objectives overlay standards that are required to be met, and equity challenges the derived solutions pushing policy toward feasible and just solutions. The descriptive model for river water quality; management model for water quality in rivers; and regional treatment plant siting are described in the chapter. From a mathematical programming perspective, the fundamental issues in air quality management are issues concerning the allocation of limited resources. The physical and chemical processes that govern air pollutant transport and transformation are similar and identical to those for water-based pollutants.

However, the entire composition of the engine emissions should be considered when evaluating the environmental benefits of these new fuels, and also the continued performance of these engines in actual fleet service. In this study the exhaust emissions from methanol, ethanol, and diesel-powered buses were determined during transient operation of the vehicles on a heavy duty chassis dynamometer. The tests of the alcohol fuelled buses, and a control diesel bus were conducted as the buses accumulated mileage in revenue generating service. The buses were tested at various simulated vehicle loadings over four driving cycles.

Of those SSSIs which occur in acid‐sensitive areas of Britain, 196 have water bodies. The following information was obtained for each site if available: details of local geology and soils, types of land use and management, water quality data and data relating to biological components of both the aquatic and riparian habitats. In addition, samples from 112 water bodies were collected for water chemistry and epilithic diatom analysis. Results from each site were placed into existing critical loads and species response models to determine whether acidification had occurred. Results showed that the fresh waters on 141 SSSIs had probably suffered acidification. This was most acute in north Wales, with mid Wales, south‐west and north‐east Scotland and northern England also being badly affected. A wide variety of changes in the biological status of water bodies relating to acidification were found to have been recorded on SSSIs, ranging from phytoplankton, invertebrate and macrophyte community changes to decline of fish, amphibian, bird and mammal populations. Catchment afforestation may be a problem in poorly buffered areas and has probably contributed to freshwater acidification on 40 SSSIs. Comparison with critical loads maps for acidity in UK fresh waters reveals that existing commitments on acidifying emissions (the EC Large Combustion Plant Directive) will not be sufficient to prevent further acidification on a number of SSSIs. In order to achieve a protection of the nature conservation interest of fresh waters further commitments to emission reductions will be necessary.

These analyses track the history of lead contamination in the lake, as well as the transport of particulate matter which governs the redistribution of particle-reactive contaminants within the lake. The isotopic compositions of the sediments reveal two sources of natural lead (fluvial and shoreline bluff erosion) and three primary sources of anthropogenic lead (coal combustion, gasoline additives, and municipal waste water discharges) to the lake. Lead concentrations and isotopic compositions of 210Pb-dated sediment cores record historical variations in the inputs from these sources. The heterogeneous isotopic composition of the three basins of Lake Erie indicates that lead from municipal effluent is most prominent in the urbanized western region of the lake and that atmospheric deposition is most prominent in the more rural eastern areas. Calculations based on a 207Pb206Pb vs. 208Pb206Pb linear mixing model show that as much as 70% of sediment in the Central Basin and 25% in the East Basin originates from the West Basin of Lake Erie.

These facilities may be required to apply technology-based standards such as maximum achievable control technology (MACT) to their emitting processes. A new legislation will be implemented by specific rules and regulations promulgated by federal (EPA), state, and local agencies. Once rules are promulgated, facilities may have to conduct compliance tests and trial burns to demonstrate compliance with emission limits. The process of planning and performing such tests is formidable due to the planning time requirement and the high cost. This paper presents a computer modeling approach to predict metals behavior in coal-fired combustion systems. This treatment is not intended to be a substitute for actual compliance tests but can serve as a guide to help planners, engineers, and facility owners/operators predict the levels of metals emissions from their facilities, and to gain an insight into the impact of operating conditions on metals behavior. To test the predictive applicability of the modeling approach, predictions of the overall partitioning of metals in a pulverized bituminous coal-fired combustor were compared to measured data from full-scale facilities in the Netherlands. In general, the comparison between predicted and measured values is favorable. This indicates that using the modeling approach described in this paper can be effective in planning tests, optimizing operating conditions, and determining the effectiveness of air pollution control equipment prior to conducting actual compliance tests. © 1994.",,"Air Pollution; Coal-Fired Systems; Combustion; Emissions; Metals; Prediction Model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028056817

The low detection limit (1 ng/tube) and the rapidity of the assay permitted extensive study (daily for eighteen months) of BaP concentration in air particulate matter in the city of Bologna. For each assay air was aspirated for 24 h and passed through a cellulose filter which retained the particulate matter and, after a simple extraction step, the BaP was quantitatively analyzed. Pb, Cr, V, Ni and Cd and total particles were also measured from the same filter. Meteorological parameters including temperature, humidity, rain, wind, barometric pressure and cloudiness were recorded. Exhaust gases such as NO2, CO and SO2 were also monitored daily. The data were analyzed by a chemometrical approach involving univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. The obtained results show a good predictive power of BaP with respect to the presence of metals and gases, and we were also able to identify two sources of BaP, i.e., heating and traffic. Weather conditions in general, and temperature and cloudiness in particular, play a major role in determining BaP levels. During spring and summer, BaP/Pb ratio was drastically reduced as a result of increased solar radiation and temperature, which may be a cause of BaP photodecomposition. The overall results suggest that BaP analysis of air particulate matter is useful in monitoring urban environmental pollution, and that this method could be complementary to conventional ones which identify markers such as gases or heavy metals, resulting in a more complete and detailed monitoring program of urban air pollution. © 1994.","Air particulate matter; Benzo[a]pyrene; Enzymatic methods; Immunoassay","benzo[a]pyrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; air pollution; article; enzyme immunoassay; multivariate analysis; particulate matter; priority journal; weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028053414

The reactions were studied at temperatures from 673 to 1223 K and at partial NO and N2O pressures in the range of 0.62-3.08 and 0.19-1.92 mbar, respectively. The reactor pressure was 2.5 bar and the space time W FNO,o(N2O,o)) was either 79280 or 100140 g s/mol for NO and N2O, respectively. Four coals ranging from lignite to anthracite were used as char precursors. N2O was more readily reduced on a coal char surface than NO. The kinetic parameters for the NO and N2O decomposition on a char surface were rather dependent on char structure. Apparent activation energies in the range of 111-181 and 66-104 kJ/mol were obtained for NO and N2O decomposition, respectively. Apparent reaction orders for NO decomposition on the chars ranged from 0.22 to 0.43. In the case of N2O, an order of ∼ 0.6 was found except for DE53 char that showed an almost zero order at lower temperatures. A large confidence interval was found for the reaction order, which indicates that it is changing with temperature. The rate of NO decomposition by char is strongly enhanced by the presence of CO and N2O; this is ascribed to surface oxygen removal. CO had no effect on N2O decomposition, since N2O itself acts as a surface oxygen liberating species. When O2 was added to the NO/char reaction, the NO decomposition increased at the beginning of the addition, but this effect decreased with time because of the rapid combustion of the char. O2 did not affect the N2O/char reaction. © 1994.",,"Fluidized bed combustion; Nitrogen oxides; Pressure effects; Reaction kinetics; Thermal effects; Confidence interval; Kinetic parameters; Reactor pressure; Coal combustion; carbon monoxide; charcoal; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; oxygen; ozone; catalysis; chemical reaction kinetics; coal gasification; combustion; conference paper; decomposition; fluidized bed; greenhouse effect; ozone layer; priority journal; temperature; Combustion; Fluidized Beds-Gas/Solid; Nitrogen Oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028670320

Plant growth is nearly always stimulated by elevation of CO2. Photosynthesis increases, more plant biomass accumulates per unit of water consumed, and economic yield is enhanced. The profitable use of supplemental CO2 over years of greenhouse practice points to the value of CO2 for plant production. Plant responses to CO2 are known to interact with other environmental factors, e.g. light, temperature, soil water, and humidity. Important stresses including drought, temperature, salinity, and air pollution have been shown to be ameliorated when CO2 levels are elevated. In the agricultural context, the growing season has been shortened for some crops with the application of more CO2; less water use has generally, but not always, been observed and is under further study; experimental studies have shown that economic yield for most crops increases by about 33% for a doubling of ambient CO2 concentration. However, there are some reports of negligible or negative effects. Plant species respond differently to CO2 enrichment, therefore, clearly competitive shifts within natural communities could occur. Though of less importance in managed agro-ecosystems, competition between crops and weeds could also be altered. Tissue composition can vary as CO2 increases (e.g. higher C: N ratios) leading to changes in herbivory, but tests of crop products (consumed by man) from elevated CO2 experiments have generally not revealed significant differences in their quality. However, any CO2-induced change in plant chemical or structural make-up could lead to alterations in the plant's interaction with any number of environmental factors-physicochemical or biological. Host-pathogen relationships, defense against physical stressors, and the capacity to overcome resource shortages could be impacted by rises in CO2. Root biomass is known to increase but, with few exceptions, detailed studies of root growth and function are lacking. Potential enhancement of root growth could translate into greater rhizodeposition, which, in turn, could lead to shifts in the rhizosphere itself. Some of the direct effects of CO2 on vegetation have been reasonably well-studied, but for others work has been inadequate. Among these neglected areas are plant roots and the rhizosphere. Therefore, experiments on root and rhizosphere response in plants grown in CO2-enriched atmospheres will be reviewed and, where possible, collectively integrated. To this will be added data which have recently been collected by us. Having looked at the available data base, we will offer a series of hypotheses which we consider as priority targets for future research. © 1993.","carbon dioxide; global change; plants; rhizosphere; roots","carbon dioxide enrichment; rhizosphere; root; carbon dioxide; agriculture; air pollution; biomass; conference paper; crop; greenhouse effect; humidity; light; photosynthesis; plant growth; plant root; soil; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028311981

Photochemical oxidants in the northeastern United States were simulated for the period 2-17 July 1988, one of the most severe air stagnation episodes in the last decade. In the simulations, biogenic hydrocarbon emissions were adjusted by a factor of 3 to account for the existing range of uncertainty in these emissions. The impact of biogenic emission uncertainties on O3 predictions depended upon the availability of NOx. In most cases, O3 concentrations increased in response to increases in biogenic hydrocarbon emissions. However, in some extremely NOx-limited areas, increasing the amount of biogenic emissions decreased O3 concentrations. Two control strategies were also examined in the simulations: (1) reduced anthropogenic hydrocarbon emissions, and (2) reduced anthropogenic hydrocarbon and NOx emissions. The simulations showed that controls of hydrocarbon emissions were more beneficial to the New York City area, but that combined NO, and hydrocarbon controls were more beneficial to other areas of the Northeast. For the most part, the preference for a combined strategy persisted across the range of uncertainty in biogenic emissions. There were some localized areas where the preference for control technique depended upon the assumed level of biogenic emissions. © 1994.","biogenic emissions; emission control strategies; model uncertainty; Ozone; regional modeling","biogenic emission; control strategy; emssion uncertainty; ozone; photochemical modelling; regional modelling; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Atmospheric structure; Computer simulation; Environmental impact; Hydrocarbons; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Regional planning; Troposphere; Biogenic emission; Hydrocarbon emission; Oxidants; Pollutants; Particulate emissions; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air pollution; air pollution control; article; mathematical model; photochemical smog; photochemistry; priority journal; simulation; united states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028450137

This approach places limits on air pollution by maintaining a baseline value for air quality, no matter what the ecosystem can or cannot withstand. In this paper, we present example critical levels maps for the conterminous U.S. developed using the 'effects-based' mapping approach as defined by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, Task Force on Mapping. This approach emphasizes the pollution level or load capacity an ecosystem can accommodate before degradation occurs, and allows for analysis of cumulative effects. We present the first stage of an analysis that reports the distribution of exceedances of critial levels for NO2, SO2, and O3 in sensitive forest, crop, and natural vegetation ecosystems in the contiguous United States. We conclude that extrapolation to surrounding geographic areas requires the analysis of diverse and compounding factors that preclude simple extrapolation methods. Pollutant data depicted in this analysis is limited to locationally specific data, and would be enhanced by utilizing spatial statistics, along with converging associated anthropogenic and climatological factors. Values used for critical levels were derived from current scientific knowledge. While not intended to be a definitive value, adjustments will occur as the scientific community gains new insight to pollutant/receptor relationships. We recommend future analysis to include a refinement of sensitive receptor data coverages and to report relative proportions of exceedances at varying grid scales. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"critical level; crop; crtical level; forest; mapping; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulphur dioxide; vegetation; USA; Agriculture; Mapping; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Sulfur dioxide; Critical level; Crops; Forests; Natural vegetation; United states; Air pollution; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air pollution; article; controlled study; crop; data analysis; environmental management; forest; geographic distribution; nonhuman; united states; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028410976

Water for agriculture will be in shorter supply and will be more costly. New technologies and higher levels of management will be needed to reduce agricultural emissions of CH4 and N2O. If not too costly, some of the technologies proposed could actually improve production efficiencies and profitability. Afforestation on a massive scale has been proposed as a means of reducing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. Afforestation on the requisite scale will create considerable competition with agriculture for good land. Afforesting waste lands and recently deforested lands In the tropics may relieve some pressure for afforestation in the temperate regions. Geoengineering has been proposed as a strategy to counteract inadvertent climate change. Not all of the geoengineering schemes proposed have obvious linkages to agriculture, but some may have. CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere is known to increase photosynthesis, decrease evapotranspiration and improve water-use efficiency. It is difficult to know how severe the effects of climate change will be (and where?) so that we cannot confidently state that they will (or will not) be offset by CO2 enrichment. In this paper we speculate about whether the mitigation measures described above alter comparative advantage of developed and developing country agricultures, how this might happen, and how these changes might affect regional food security. Those mitigation measures that increase demands for water and land make it more difficult for agriculture to compete for these resources pose the greatest threats to global food security. © 1994.",,"agriculture; climate change mitigation; food security",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028327888

Survival and recovery of the examined methanotrophs were generally highest for cultures starved under anoxic conditions as indicated by poststarvation measurements of methane oxidation, tetrazolium salt reduction, plate counts, and protein synthesis. Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b survived up to 6 weeks of carbon deprivation under anoxic conditions while maintaining a physiological state that allowed relatively rapid (hours) methane oxidation after substrate addition. A small fraction of cells starved under oxic and anoxic conditions (4 and 10%, respectively) survived more than 10 weeks but required several days for recovery on plates and in liquid medium. A non-spore-forming methanotroph, strain WP 12, displayed 36 to 118% of its initial methane oxidation capacity after 5 days of carbon deprivation. Oxidation rates varied with growth history prior to the experiments as well as with starvation conditions. Strain WP 12 starved under anoxic conditions showed up to 90% higher methane oxidation activity and 46% higher protein production after starvation than did cultures starved under oxic conditions. Only minor changes in biomass and morphology were seen for methanotrophic bacteria starved under anoxic conditions. In contrast, starvation under oxic conditions resulted in morphology changes and an initial 28 to 35% loss of cell protein. These data suggest that methanotrophic bacteria can survive carbon deprivation under anoxic conditions by using maintenance energy derived solely from an anaerobic endogenous metabolism. This capability could partly explain a significant potential for methane oxidation in environments not continuously supporting aerobic methanotrophic growth.",,"anoxia; article; bacterial growth; bacterial metabolism; cell structure; controlled study; methanotrophic bacterium; nonhuman; starvation; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methylosinus trichosporium; Trichosporium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028235537

One such tool, recently constructed for the Environment Directorate of the Commission of the European Communities,1 consists of an interactive climate change impact assessment model called ESCAPE. This paper describes the model framework and illustrates the use of ESCAPE using a range of input scenarios reflecting different global policy, economic and technological futures. Three important characteristics of the global climate change problem are well illustrated: past emissions of greenhouse gases and the inertia of the global development path have committed the world to future warming irrespective of current and near-future policy interventions; the efficacy of a climate policy implemented solely within the EC on altering the course of future climate change is very small; and the impacts of climate change on the economy and environment of the European Community differ markedly between northern and southern Europe. © 1994.",,"climatic change; ESCAPE model; planning technique; policy evaluation; regional impact; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028158962

As Si and C sources, SiH4, Si2H6, and C3H8 or other similar short-chain hydrocarbons are used together with hydrogen as a carrier gas. Graphite reacts with the hydrogen to form a lot of different hydrocarbon species at these high temperatures. The partial pressure and composition of these hydrocarbons depend on the temperature of the susceptor surface. We calculated the amount of carbon and the various compounds formed at equilibrium conditions. In some experimental setups it is possible that the amount of hydrocarbon formed by the graphite susceptor exceeds the concentration of the input hydrocarbon. In this case the gas phase in the growth region is independent of the carbon source gas. By a quadrupole mass spectrometer in the outlet part of the reactor, we measured the different CHx fractions in the output gas and found that they are not influenced by any change of the input hydrocarbons. © 1994.",,"Chemical vapor deposition; Composition; Graphite; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Mass spectrometers; Molecular structure; Pressure; Surfaces; Thermal effects; Carrier gas; Susceptors; Silicon carbide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028761989

The cooler model was integrated with a comprehensive building thermal analysis program and verified successfully. The applicability of the new integrated model is illustrated through a number of practical examples.

The KIVA code is being used for the computations, with improved submodels for liquid breakup, drop distortion and drag, spray/wall impingement with rebounding, sliding and breaking-up drops, wall heat transfer with unsteadiness and compressibility, multistep kinetics ignition and laminar-turbulent characteristic time combustion models, Zeldovich NOx formation, and soot formation with Nagle Strickland-Constable oxidation. The code also allows computations of the intake flow process in the realistic engine geometry with the two moving intake valves. Significant progress has been achieved in modeling diesel combustion and emissions using the improved submodels. Comparisons with measured engine cylinder pressure, and soot and NOx emission data show that the model results are in good agreement with the experiments. This indicates that computer models are now available to provide direction for engine design. Other experimental results have been obtained recently that show that significant reductions in soot and NOx emissions are possible using split injections. The KIVA model is currently being used to gain insight into the reasons for this improved engine performance. © Copyright 1994 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Diesel engines; Drops; Fuel injection; Fuels; Heat transfer; Ignition; Intake systems; Machine design; Nitrogen oxides; Soot; Temperature measurement; Cylinder pressures; Electronic fuel injections; Engine development time; Engine performance; Gas temperature measurements; Predictive modeling; Turbulent characteristics; Wall heat transfer; Engine cylinders",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072437189

The experiments were carried out using an isothermal recycle reactor operated at 499 K with various values of the cycling frequency and the phase angle between the two composition cycles. Time-average CO conversions as high as five times the steady-state conversion were attained during the forced feed cycling. The observed dynamic behavior of the system has been described by a kinetic model consisting of three elementary steps which incorporates two main features, namely, the adsorbate-induced Pt surface-phase transformation (1 × 1 ↔ hex) and the self-exclusion of CO during adsorption on the Pt surface. The model was able to describe quantitatively the experimental results of the steady-state multiplicity behavior of the reaction. Thus, a simple model provides a consistent explanation for both the observed rate enhancement and dynamic CO2, response during input cycling and the steady-state multiplicity. © 1994 by Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000668589

Various idling speeds (600-1200 RPM), rich mixtures (10 < AF < 13), and spark timings (20 deg BTDC to 10 deg ATDC) were investigated. The cooling-system thermostat was kept in the 'stuck-open' position in order to simulate prolonged warm-up period. Investigations were conducted to find out the effects of these off-design settings on HC and CO emissions. The study shows that these emissions in the exhaust manifold increase by decreasing the engine idling speed, decreasing the coolant temperature, and advancing the spark timing. The blowby rate of flow increases as the idling speed is reduced. In the case when the cooling-system thermostat was in the stuck-open position, the warm-up period took about 30 minutes before the blowby rate and emissions concentrations subsided to their steady-state values. These concentrations were correlated in a time-dependent form. Based on the present results, the outline of a possible strategy is proposed for enforcing emission-control legislations in Egypt (as well as third-world countries with similar problems).",,"Air pollution; Air pollution control; Carbon monoxide; Cooling systems; Environmental impact; Exhaust systems (engine); Gas emissions; Hydrocarbons; Machine design; Maintenance; Thermostats; Blowby rate; Cooling system thermostat; Engine maintenance; Maintenance malpractice; Off design settings; Exhaust gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027929143

The shapes of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) type flow curves are almost independent of carbon content. Peak flow stress as well as steady state flow stress rapidly decrease with increase in carbon content and approach a certain value in high concentration, i.e. solid solution softening takes place in the range of higher strain. On the other hand, flow stresses in the range of initial work hardening rapidly increase and then go to a saturation, i.e. solid solution hardening occurs at lower strains. The solid solution softening for stresses at higher strain can be attributed to the enhanced DRX caused by increased diffusivity of vacancy due to the addition of carbon.

A 3° wide band of emission along the plane was detected near the center which shows clustering on the 1° scale of the instrument's resolution. A significant part of this narrow band of emission is either from a concentrated region of diffuse emission between 350° and 0° Galactic longitude or from up to five discrete sources. Support for this discrete source interpretation comes from the fact that five of the seven most significant event concentrations correlate in position with five of the seven previously detected hard X-ray and higher energy gamma-ray sources in the Galactic center region.","Balloons; Diffuse radiation; Galaxy: center; Gamma rays: observations; Instrumentation: detectors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044256431

Regional CBF was measured with 15-μm radiolabeled microspheres in hypocapnic, normocapnic, and hypercapnic conditions. CO2 responsiveness of each region was determined from the equation of the best-fit regression lines to the obtained flow values. The effect of altered endothelial and/or neuronal NO synthesis on CO2 responsiveness was studied following either selective blockade of the NO synthase enzyme by N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L- NAME; 3 or 30 mg/kg i.v.) or simultaneous administration of L-NAME (3 mg/kg i.v.) and a large dose of the NO precursor L-arginine (30 mg/kg i.v.). Blockade of NO synthesis by 30 mg/kg L-NAME resulted in a significant reduction of the steady-state regional blood flow values and in an almost complete abolition of the CO2 sensitivity in each region studied. Changes of the basal flow values as well as the reduction of the regional CO2 sensitivity were dose dependent. Hypothalamic, sensorimotor cortical, and cerebellar regions were the areas most sensitive to the NO blockade. Impaired CO2 responsiveness following NO synthase inhibition, however, was reversed in these regions by simultaneous administration of a large dose of intravenously injected L-arginine. These findings suggest a major role of nitric oxide in the mediation of regional cerebrovascular CO2 responsiveness in cats.","Cerebral blood flow; CO2 responsiveness; Endothelium-derived relaxing factor; L-Arginine; Nitric oxide; Nitric oxide synthase; Spinal cord blood flow","nitric oxide; nitric oxide synthase; animal experiment; animal model; arterial pressure; article; blood vessel reactivity; brain blood vessel; cat; controlled study; enzyme inhibition; hypercapnia; hypocapnia; male; nonhuman; priority journal; spinal cord blood flow; vascular endothelium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028154091

At the same mean PFD, the mean photosynthetic rates were reduced under flashing as compared to continuous light. However, as the duration of the low PFD period lengthened, the CO2 assimilation attributable to a lightfleck increased. This enhanced lightfleck CO2 assimilation was accounted for by a greater postillumination CO2 fixation occurring after the lightfleck. The induction state of photosynthesis, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco), fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and ribulose 5-phosphate kinase (Ru5P kinase) activities all responded similarly and were all lower under flashing as compared to constant PFD of the same integrated mean value. However, the fast phase of induction and FBPase and Ru5P kinase activities were reduced more than were the slow phase of induction and rubisco activity. This was consistent with the role of the former enzymes in the fast induction component that limited RuBP regeneration. Competition for reducing power between carbon metabolism and thioredoxin-mediated enzyme activation may have resulted in lower enzyme activation states and hence lower induction states under flashing than continuous PFD, especially at low lightfleck frequencies (low mean PFD). © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase; lightfleck use efficiency; photosynthetic induction; photosynthetic regulation; ribulose; soybean",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028103064

For the region in general, the simulation of 1 × CO2 mean temperature is generally better than that for mean precipitation, and summer is the season best modelled for each variable. At the scale of individual grid squares, DJF (December, January, February) (temperature) and JJA (June, July, August) (precipitation) are the seasons best modelled. The GCM‐simulated increases in mean annual temperature resulting from a doubling of CO2 are of the order of 5 to 6°C in the Prairie region, with much of this increase resulting from substantial warming in the winter and spring. Increases in mean annual precipitation are of the order of 50 to 150 mm (changes of +5 to +15%), with the greatest changes again occurring in winter and spring. As far as the limited GCM run durations allow, temperature and precipitation variance generally show no significant changes from a 1 × CO2 to a 2 × CO2 climate. Increased precipitation in winter and spring does not result in greater snow accumulations owing to the magnitude of warming; and significant decreases in soil moisture content occur in summer and fall. The resulting effects on the growing season and moisture regime have the potential to affect agricultural practices in the area. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84155180000

Wastes comprising solids, liquids and gases, and their mixtures have been adequately handled in fluidized-bed incinerators in combustion and co-combustion modes. The available literature is mostly on bubbling bed but the recent trend has been also to employ the circulating-bed incinerators. The significant advantages of fluidized-bed incinerators over conventional incinerators include their compact furnace, simple design, effective burning of a wide variety of fuels, relatively uniform temperature, ability to reduce emission of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide gases, high pyrolysis rate of the waste material, high rate of solid particle oxidation as the charred surface of the waste is continuously abraded by the inert material, good mixing of solids and gases, and the fact that the gases are continuously replenished on the burning solid surface which enhances the rate of gas-phase combustion reactions. A wide variety of wastes have been burned in the fluidized-bed incinerators including municipal solid waste, agricultural waste, coal mine wastes, waste oils and sludges, wood wastes, petroleum refinery wastes, petrochemical wastes, sulfite liquors, sewage sludges, contaminated solids, and various hazardous and lethally poisonous materials. In this review several of the commercial and pilot-plant fluidized-bed incinerators have been briefly described and their findings reported. One pilot-plant is discussed in detail to bring out the general difficulties of design and an effective appreciation of the technology. These results, while promising, point to the need for further investigations to be able to successfully commercialize this technology particularly for those materials whose thermal destruction give rise to toxic emissions and whose stringent control is mandatory to avoid serious environmental pollution problems. Procedures for computing carbon combustion efficiency are discussed as are the procedures that may be employed to establish the quality of bed fluidization from the history of temperature and pressure fluctuation records, and from the computed values of different statistical functions which result. © 1994.",,"Agricultural wastes; Environmental impact; Fluidization; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized bed combustors; Furnaces; Industrial wastes; Nitrogen oxides; Pilot plants; Pyrolysis; Sulfur dioxide; Wood wastes; Bubbling bed; Environmental pollution problems; Gas phase combustion reactions; Municipal solid wastes; Thermal destruction; Waste incineration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028742798

Firstly, when clouds form due to mixing air masses, real-time CCN measurements show that CCN concentrations could register an increase around such clouds due to differences in the aerosol content of the two air masses (the mechanism being the transport of new CCN to the measurement site). Secondly, due to sulfate production within clouds themselves, the CCN concentration in the air mass processed by such clouds could be elevated due to a shift in the size distribution and chemical composition of the existing aerosol particles. Thirdly, new aerosol particles could be formed by the process of homogeneous, heteromolecular nucleation in the vicinity of and within clouds resulting from a modification of the supersaturation field. The third mechanism is capable of enhancing simultaneously both condensation nuclei (CN) and CCN concentrations. By analyzing the existing field measurements, examples demonstrating the enhancement in CCN concentration within clouds, close to the cloud top, and in clear but moist air above the cloud tops are provided. It is pointed out that for CCN to play an effective role in climate-regulation (i.e. counteracting the greenhouse warming due to CO2 etc.), their number concentrations should increase by as much as a factor of four which would cause an increase in the global albedo by ≈ 1.7%. Current evidence shows that such a CCN enhancement may be possible locally but is not observable in general. Although anthropogenically influenced arctic stratus clouds were observed to produce significant CCN enhancement, no such effect was observed in antarctic stratus clouds. A model based on homogeneous, heteromolecular aerosol particle production was used to calculate particle production. Model results of sensitivity studies are presented that explain why the observations of this phenomenon so far have been so few. Enhanced actinic radiation flux, high relative humidity, abundance of gaseous sulfur, and long life span of clouds are found to be common features of observations that indicate CCN enhancement within clouds. Such clouds are very active photochemically. Sampling artifacts encountered in airborne observations could also occur and may explain partially or totally the observed CCN enhancement although this explanation is far from satisfactory and precludes the observed CCN enhancement in clear moist layers above the cloud tops. © 1994.",,"cloud; cloud condensation nuclei; enhancement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028317453

The measurements show the development of large-scale vortical structures in the mixing region adjacent to the central jet. These structures result in instantaneous radial profiles that differ considerably from the classical time-averaged Gaussian profiles measured previously using single-point measurements. The profiles typically consist of one or two plateau regions of relatively uniform concentration and are consistent with planar measurements obtained by other investigators in constant density and reacting flows. The results suggest a mixing model in which the dominant mechanism for entrainment is large-scale engulfment of surrounding air by the vortical structures, followed by rapid mixing with jet fluid.

We have found that reflected light microscopy constitutes a simple and appropriate technique for revealing the state of planarity of carbon films commonly used for supporting specimens in electron microscopy. Carbon films evaporated onto mica and deposited onto copper grids presented a highly wrinkled aspect. In contrast, carbon films prepared after evaporation on nitrocellulose presented large areas with an homogeneous flat aspect, while other areas were wrinkled. The wrinkled aspect was also detected by transmission electron microscopy at extremely high values of defocusing, by scanning electron microscopy using highly tilted specimens, and was emphasized by Nomarski differential interference contrast in reflected light microscopy. We further characterized the surface of carbon films by atomic force microscopy. The wrinkled aspect was shown to be directly related to the presence of folds extending across carbon films. Typical values for the lateral and vertical dimensions of the folds were several micrometers and several hundred nanometers, respectively. These defects of carbon film planarity correspond to a local tilting of carbon films of the order of 1b. We believe that the wrinkled nature of carbon films is a general feature of crucial importance for high-resolution studies. © 1994 Academic Press.

We have characterized the control region of the isocitrate lyase gene ICL1, which is derepressed more than 200-fold after transfer of cells from fermentative to nonfermentative growth conditions. Deletion analysis of the ICL1 promoter led to the identification of an upstream activating sequence element, UAS(ICL1) (5' CATTCATCCG 3'), necessary and sufficient for conferring carbon source- dependent regulation on a heterologous reporter gene. Similar sequence motifs were also found in the upstream regions of coregulated genes involved in gluconeogenesis. This carbon source-responsive element (CSRE) interacts with a protein factor, designated Ang1 (activator of nonfermentative growth), detectable only in extracts derived from derepressed cells. Gene activation mediated by the CSRE requires the positively acting derepression genes CAT1 (=SNF1 and CCR1) and CAT3 (=SNF4). In the respective mutants, Ang1-CSRE interaction was no longer observed under repressing or derepressing conditions. Since binding of Ang1 factor to the CSRE could be competed for by an upstream sequence derived from the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene FBP1, we propose that the CSRE functions as a UAS element common to genes of the gluconeogenic pathway.",,"carbon; fructose bisphosphatase; isocitrate lyase; article; culture medium; fermentation; gene activation; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; gene repression; gluconeogenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; reporter gene; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028302020

A scanner camera operating in the mid infrared was installed at the waste-to-energy plant in Coburg, Germany during the experiments. Selection of an appropriate wavelength region allows the direct imaging of the fuel bed through the overlying flame and flue gas atmosphere and the determination of temperature distributions within seconds. The fast response time of the thermography system compared to shielded thermocouples allows the detection of furnace temperature fluctuations on a short time scale of a few minutes. These data can be used for fine tuning of the total underfire air (UFA) flow. Local imbalances in fuel bed temperature are evaluated to redistribute UFA between individual grate zones. The influence of variations in calorific value on the position of the main zone of combustion can easily be measured, thus allowing the sensitive adaptation of UFA distribution to local requirements. Incorporation of the camera system results in an improved overall consistency of the combustion process, as reflected by a reduction of excess air fluctuations and of temperature imbalances across the grate. Measurements in the Coburg plant have shown that flue gas as well as residue burnout quality was improved. Compared with conventional control, emissions of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons were reduced, and also the fraction of unburned matter in the residue. © 1994.",,"Cameras; Carbon monoxide; Control systems; Flue gases; Hydrocarbons; Reduction; Refuse incinerators; Temperature distribution; Thermocouples; Thermography (temperature measurement); Furnace temperature fluctuations; Residue burnout quality; Total underfire air; Waste to energy plant; Combustion; hydrocarbon; article; combustion; control system; incineration; priority journal; thermography; waste disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028533382

This flow, derived from the radiative surface entropy budget, is approximately inversely related to the surface temperature when the solar incident flux remains constant. In the geophysiological ('gaian') interpretation, biospheric self-organization has increased with the progressive colonization of the continents and evolutionary developments in the land biota, as a result of surface cooling arising from biotic enhancement of weathering. The key site for this self-organization is at the interface between land and atmosphere, the soil, where carbon is sequestered by its reaction (as carbonic and organic acids) with calcium magnesium silicates. Along with disequilibrium (steady-state) levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the occurrence of differentiated soil is the critical material evidence for biospheric self-organization, whether it be geophysiological or geochemical (ie., purely result of inorganic reactions). The computed equilibrium levels of carbon dioxide and corresponding equilibrium temperatures in the past are dramatically different from the steady-state levels. With future solar luminosity increase, the biospheric capacity for climatic regulation will decrease, leading to the ending of self-organization some two billion years from now. The Earth's surface will then approach chemical equilibrium with respect to the carbonate-silicate cycle. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"biosphere; Gaia; geochemistry; geophysiology; self organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028591593

These surface organometallic complexes can therefore be considered to belong to both the molecular and solid states. In cases where such complexes have been structurally characterised, their reactivity can be interpreted with molecular concepts. In this review article, the stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity of some relatively well-defined surface organometallic fragments is surveyed. Many elementary steps which have precedent in molecular organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis have now been demonstrated with surface organometallic fragments, including reversible ligand binding, oxidative addition, reductive elimination, protonation, heterolytic metal-carbon bond cleavage, electrophilic CH bond activation and insertion into metal-carbon bonds. In some cases, the supported organometallic complexes are highly effective low temperature catalysts, a phenomenon which is not always observed with molecular analogues nor with conventionally prepared heterogeneous catalysts. Applications of surface organometallic chemistry to catalytic alkane hydrogenolysis, olefin isomerisation and hydrogenation, the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and the water-gas shift reaction are discussed. Proposed mechanisms for several representative catalytic cycles are presented. © 1994.","catalytic reactivity; inorganic oxides; organometallic fragments; surface chemistry","Catalysis; Catalysts; Complexation; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Hydrogenation; Isomerization; Molecular structure; Oxides; Surface phenomena; Catalytic reactivity; Inorganic oxides; Organometallic fragment; Stoichiometric reactivity; Surface chemistry; Water gas shift reaction; Organometallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028762278

Initially, the formation of hot band textures has been investigated in terms of the influence of rolling temperature and reduction. A low carbon steel sheet has been also studied to clarify the features of IF steel sheets. Subsequently, the textures formed by rolling and annealing has been studied at the surface and the midplane of IF steel sheets. The formation of the recrystallization texture has been discussed taking into consideration of the stored energy and the crystal rotation relationship around the axes between the orientation of the recrystallized grain and the surrounding deformed matrix. It was also shown that the consideration of the local crystal rotations in the vicinity of grain boundaries due to rolling facilitates the understanding of the formation of the recrystallization texture. The obtained results led to the conclusion that the a-region hot rolling under certain conditions is a very effective means of improving the deep drawability of IF steel sheets. © 1994, The Iron and Steel Institute of Japan.

In the fluid phase it is found that the protein has only a slight effect on the first moment of the 2H spectrum, which for perdeuterated chains is a direct measure of the average chain orientational order. However, analysis of the rate of change of the first moment with respect to protein concentration, at different temperatures within the fluid phase, shows that at a molar protein concentration of about 0.0295 ± 0.01, the lipid chain order (or M1) is essentially independent of temperature. At this concentration the chain order is determined by the lipid's interaction with the protein and one can conclude that about 34 (±12) lipids are required to solvate the protein. At higher lipid concentrations these lipids are freely exchanging, on the NMR time scale, with the other lipids in the bilayer. At glycophorin concentrations below about 1 mol% there is a two-phase coexistence region at temperatures below the pure lipid's chain melting transition. The boundary between the fluid phase and this two-phase region curves downwards (is concave downwards), whereas the boundary between the two-phase region and the gel phase, while naturally occurring at lower temperatures than the upper boundary, is concave upwards. As a consequence the protein partitions preferentially into the fluid phase. This behaviour is similar to that observed in a number of other protein/lipid and peptide/lipid mixtures where it was suggested that those systems may have been close to a critical mixing point and some characteristics of a continuous phase change were noted. Indeed, at glycophorin concentrations near and above 1 mol% there are indications that the phase behaviour becomes more complex, suggesting the presence of significant protein/protein interactions and that this system may be close to a critical point. © 1994.","Glycophorin; Lipid-protein interaction; NMR, 2H-; Phase equilibrium","deuterium; dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; glycophorin; dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; glycophorin; article; chemistry; lipid bilayer; mathematics; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; protein conformation; temperature; human; human cell; lipid analysis; phospholipid bilayer; priority journal; protein analysis; protein lipid interaction; protein protein interaction; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; Deuterium; Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; Glycophorin; Lipid Bilayers; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Mathematics; Protein Conformation; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028168727

Mean daily fluxes ranged from 0.6-68.4 mg CH4 m-2d-1 in plant communities dominated by Chamaedaphne calyculata, an eficaceous shrub, to 11.5-209 mg CH4 m-2d-1 in areas dominated by plants with aerenchymatous tissues, such as Carex oligosperma and Scheuchzeria palustris. Correlations between methane flux and water table position were significant at all sites for one annual cycle when water table fluctuations ranged from 15 cm above to 50 cm below the peat surface. Correlations were not significant during the second and third annual periods with smaller water table fluctuations. Methane flux was strongly correlated with peat temperatures at -5 to -40 cm (rs = 0.82 to 0.98) for all three years at sites with flora acting as conduits for methane transport. At shrub sites, the correlations between methane flux and peat temperature were weak to not significant during the first two years, but were strong in the third year. Low rates of methane consumption (-0.2 to -1.5 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 ) were observed at shrub sites when the water table was below -20 cm, while sites with plants capable of methane transport always had positive net fluxes of methane. The methane oxidizing potential at both types of sites was confirmed by peat core experiments. The results of this study indicate that methane emissions occur at rates that cannot be explained by diffusion alone; plant communities play a significant role in altering methane flux from peatland ecosystems by directly transporting methane from anaerobic peat to the atmosphere. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","bogs; methane; peatlands; wetlands","methane; peatland; temperature; water table position; USA, Michigan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028163522

Market-based strategies, driven by price mechanisms, have been proposed as the best and most efficient way to decrease traffic congestion and to reduce vehicle emission. Congestion pricing, emission fees, reducing emissions of high-polluting vehicles, and introducing more efficient vehicle and/or fuel technologies are not mutually exclusive strategies and therefore they can be employed jointly within an overall strategy. In view of the conflicting objectives that may exist between improving urban air quality and reducing road fatalities and traffic congestion, it is of great importance to investigate thoroughly these functional relationships.

We have reanalyzed the infrared emission-line spectrum of the Galactic center in order to consider whether the data could actually be explained with photoionization by a relatively hard, yet dilute continuum, and additionally to constrain the properties of the radiating plasma. We conclude that the composite infrared spectrum does not place strong restrictions on the nature of the ionizing continuum and that much of the ionized gas in the Galactic center is probably quite dense (≳105 cm-3). If the ionizing spectral energy distribution is, in fact, relatively hard, this material additionally must be highly clumped. Indications that the ionizing continuum is probably fairly soft are provided by radio recombination-line studies, however. Shocks are unlikely to be important for generating the observed nebulosity in light of the large far-infrared continuum luminosity of the central parsec. The infrared fine-structure spectrum provides mixed evidence for enhanced heavy-element abundances, and enrichment is probably limited to ≲2 times solar levels. We predict the optical spectrum of the Galactic center and conclude that it probably appears as an H II nucleus to external observers. Comparisons between the nucleus of the Milky Way and nuclei of external galaxies remain uncertain, however, since the parsec-scale metric apertures typically employed for studies of Galactic-center nebular emission are 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than those used in extragalactic measurements.","Galaxies: nuclei; Galaxy: center; H II regions; Infrared: ISM: lines and bands",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044254375

The Rh(I) model complexes are of the general form RhXL where X is either a hydrogen or a chlorine and where L stands for a lone-pair ligand. Lone-pair ligands with a varying amount of π-bonding were investigated. It is suggested that a combination of hydride and lone-pair ligands with a minimum of π-bonding should be an optimal combination for the methane reaction. Of the systems studied here, RhH(NH3) thus gives the most stable products and the lowest transition state energy. The trends of the results are analyzed and compared to the results for the corresponding Ru(I) complexes. In a previous study it was found that RuH2 has a very low barrier for the methane reaction. In order to approach more realistic systems the reactant RuH2 is modified in various ways in the present study. First, the hydrides are substituted by methyl groups and halides. Secondly, lone-pair ligands are added. The conclusions are that it should be advantageous for the methane reaction to have methyl (or more general R groups) and lone-pair ligands with as small a covalent bonding as possible. To make a Ru(II) complex activate methane, which has not yet been done experimentally, halide ligands and lone-pair ligands with strong π-bonding should be avoided. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

Some relevant techniques are briefly discussed. Emphasis is put on various aspects of photoacoustic spectrometry. Its basic principles and important experimental characteristics are outlined. Depending on molecular absorption cross-sections, a detection limit in the low ppbv concentration range is typically achieved without the use of any preconcentration device. In multi-component mixtures this limit may be increased owing to absorption interferences. Two photoacoustic (PA) systems have been developed and some specific applications are presented. A CO-laser PA system operating in the 5-6.5 μm wavelength range was applied to the analysis of motor vehicle exhausts. Apart from nitrogen oxides, CO2 and water vapour, ten different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including o-, m- and p-xylene were selectively detected at parts per million by volume (ppmv) concentrations. As a second instrument, an automated CO2 laser PA system was implemented in a trailer for in situ measurements. It was applied to the detection of stack gases at a pharmaceutical plant and to air monitoring in urban and rural environments. As an example, ethene, ammonia and ozone were detected at ppbv concentrations in rural air.

Breakdown thresholds at these wavelengths are reported for air, CO and CO2. A significant reduction in the breakdown thresholds for both CO and CO2 is apparent when comparing 193 nm with the four Nd:YAG harmonics. This reduction is attributed to the resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization of metastable carbon atoms generated in the laser focus at the ArF-laser wavelength.

But energy will remain one of the most active driving forces of social and economic progress over the whole 21st century. This predetermines the necessity and expediency for long-term energy studies. Global energy systems recently have started the transition path from systems based on fossil fuels, with limited and exhaustible resources, to systems using inexhaustible or renewable energy resources (fission and fusion, solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, etc.). It is difficult to foresee exactly how long this transition period will last, because the rates of transition will depend on many factors - of which the most important will be energy costs at the end-user and the systems' impacts on humans, biosphere, and natural environment. Two global energy scenarios (Dynamic-as-Usual and Enhanced Energy Efficiency and Conservation, with several options for each of the scenarios) until the middle of the next century are discussed in the paper. According to energy projections, energy demand in developed countries is likely to stay at the current level over the whole time period or may even slightly decline (it is quite possible that in some countries with very high per capita energy demand, the reduction of primary energy consumption will start even in the near future). The major part of the energy demand growth worldwide will be justified by the needs of developing countries to improve their economic and social position. It is expected that primary energy demand in developing countries will increase by a factor of 3-5 compared to today's level. The world primary energy mix will very much depend on development strategies applied over the next 50-60 years. If a strategy for massive prevention of global warming is to be required, the share of fossil fuels in primary energy consumption must be remarkably reduced (even down to 25% in case of a 60% CO2 emission reduction until the middle of the next century as stated by IPCC). Electricity keeps its position as a most universal energy carrier in all sectors of end-use, including transportation. Environmental protection goals can be achieved with the most effective and less expensive ways through applying electric technologies. Therefore, a strong growth rate for electricity generation is projected in both regions - developed and developing countries. Even if radical steps are taken to prevent the impact of energy systems on global climate, the CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere will not be stopped. At the best, we can speak only of postponing the doubling of carbon concentration in the atmosphere for a couple of decades in the longer future. Parallel efforts within other spheres of the human activity are required: first of all, to stop deforestation of tropical forests, enhance reforestation, and reduce emissions of other greenhouse gases which in total contribute about 50% to global warming. The transition to an accelerated CO2 reduction policy will require about 4-5% of the world GNP spent on investments within energy systems, which is not significantly higher than today. However, the structure of investments must be drastically changed from energy production to energy conservation and savings. Large concerns exist in finding capital to provide these investments in developing countries because it will be hardly possible for them to accomplish energy/climate programs without strong assistance from the developed world. It would be naive to think that a global energy and climate change policy could be introduced without massive obligatory measures at the national and global levels. These measures should include policy actions, marketing guidelines, educational programs, financial mechanisms, and technology transfer. The realization of such a policy will require the creation of new institutional frameworks, with concerted efforts of all players on the international and national energy markets. However, there are still many unsettled questions that remain in global warming and in looking for effective response strategies. © 1994.","CO2 emissions; Energy scenario; Final energy; Global warming; Primary energy mix","climate change; emission control; energy conservation; energy demand; energy system; environmental management; future scenario; global warming; article; climate; energy resource; environmental management; greenhouse effect; health care policy; nonhuman; pollution; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028172643

At the first-order watershed scale, changes in evaporative demand, transpiration, and runoff will also occur. Previous modeling studies of the effect of increased CO2 on the water budgets of watersheds have been single-factor exercises where a single parameter representing stomatal conductance was reduced and the results noted. After showing validation results of the hydrology module, we used a comprehensive ecosystem model to examine the consequences of changes in precipitation, temperature, and CO2-induced plant-function characteristics on small-basin runoff. As a result of the complex interactions and of the compensatory mechanisms simulated by the model, we conclude that for arid and semiarid watersheds of the western United States, there will be little change or an actual decrease in surface runoff because of increased CO2 and climate change. This is due to the decrease in precipitation imposed on the model simulations. Implementing stomatal closure in the model did not increase runoff from the watersheds when temperatures were increased and precipitation decreased. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"arid zone; carbon dioxide; climate change; ecosystem model; semiarid zone; watershed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028159540

Vent incineration may lead to the formation of undesirable Products of Incomplete Combustion (PIC's). The recent Boiler &amp; Industrial Furnace (BIF) regulations have required that companies certify the ability of their Thermal Oxidizers (TOXs) to meet these new emissions’ regulations. Earlier work has focused on identifying and investigating the chemical processes leading to PIC formation. Past work has shown that PIC formation depends greatly on local process conditions. Thus, developing and implementing a methodology to predict local conditions inside a TOX may significantly enhance the ability to predict PIC formation during incineration. The present work includes developing and applying a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based incineration model to simulate the turbulent combustion processes occurring inside a TOX. Two examples demonstrate the application of the incineration model to thermal oxidation.

Trin., a C4 grass, occurs in understory habitats in the northeastern United States. Plants of M. sobolifera were grown at 23 and 30°C at 150 and 700 μmol photons m−2 s−1. The photosynthetic CO2 compensation point, maximum CO2 assimilation, dark respiration and the absorbed quantum use efficiency (QUE) were measured at 23 and 30°C at 2 and 20% O2. Photosynthetic CO2 compensation points ranged from 4 to 14mm3 dm−3 CO2 and showed limited O2 sensitivity. The mean photosynthetic CO2 compensation point of plants grown at 30°C (4·5 mm3 dm−3) was 57% lower and 80% less inhibited by O2 than that of plants grown at 23°C. Photosynthesis was similarly affected by growth temperature, with 70% more O2 inhibition in plants grown at 23°C; suppression over all treatments ranging from 2 to 11%. Unlike typical C4 species, plants of M. sobolifera from both temperature regimes exhibited higher CO2 assimilation rates when grown at low light. Growth temperature and light also affected QUE; plants grown at low light and 23°C had the highest value (0·068 mol CO2/mol quanta). Measurement temperature and growth light regime significantly affected dark respiration; however, O2 did not affect QUE or dark respiration under any growth or measurement conditions. The results indicate that M. sobolifera is adapted to low PPFD, and that complete suppression of photorespiration is dependent upon high growth temperature. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

For the initial phase of testing, a prototype CCAP was designed and evaluated on a dynamometer test-stand at the University of Tennessee. This CCAP maintained the engine's exhaust at a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio by utilizing a second oxygen sensor mounted downstream from the catalyst. In this way, the catalyst's conversion efficiency for CO and UHC was always high, even if the engine was running rich. Results of this steady-state testing indicated that the CCAP was able to reduce UHC and CO emissions without a corresponding increase in oxide of nitrogen (NOx) emissions. Additionally, catalyst temperatures did not increase dramatically. For the second phase of testing, the CCAP was installed on a vehicle and four sets of emission tests were performed at the Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Research Center Annex in Research Triangle Park, NC. As a result of testing, it was determined that the CCAP has merit as a system to decrease CO and UHC emissions during acceleration and power enrichment. However, the CCAP must be activated after the catalyst has lit-off (or it can delay catalyst light-off and result in poor emissions). NO x emissions remained essentially unchanged and catalyst temperatures did not increase by more than 110°C.

It is shown that the spectra gradually broaden to eventually split into a powder-type pattern as the particle size increases. It is concluded that the most likely structure of the surface-bound SDS aggregates at the adsorption plateau is a bilayer conformation, partly or completely covering the alumina surface. 2H NMR band shape calculations imply that the α-carbon order parameter is smaller than found in most other SDS aggregates. Indications are also found that the diffusion coefficient for lateral diffusion over curved surfaces is reduced for adsorbed SDS as compared to micellar or liquid crystalline systems. Spin relaxation measurement data are interpreted by means of a simple motional model, and by using the order parameter obtained from the band shape calculations, the correlation time for the fast local motions is calculated. It is found that these motions are sufficiently fast to fall within the extreme narrowing regime, which is also indicated by the temperature dependence of the longitudinal relaxation time (T1). Nevertheless, they are significantly slower than in other SDS aggregates investigated. An apparent activation energy is calculated from an Arrhenius plot of the T1 data, and the comparison with similar data of alkylsilanes chemisorbed on silica indicates that the motional processes behind the T1 relaxation are dominated by the alkyl chain transgauche isomerization. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

This analysis shows large-scale longitudinal and latitudinal gradients in the dust temperature and a decrease in dust temperature with increasing Galactocentric distance. The derived dust temperatures are significantly different from those derived in similar analyses using the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) 60 and 100 μm data, suggesting that small (5 Å ≲ radius ≲ 200 Å) transiently heated dust particles contribute significantly to the Galactic 60 μm emission. It is found that 60%-75% of the far-infrared luminosity arises from cold (∼17-22 K) dust associated with diffuse H I clouds, 15%-30% from cold (∼19 K) dust associated with molecular gas, and less than 10% from warm (∼29 K) dust in extended low-density H II regions, consistent with the results of the IRAS analyses of the Galactic 60 and 100 μm emission. Within 2° of longitude of the Galactic center, the derived gas-to-dust mass ratio along the line of sight, Gd, reverses its general trend of decreasing Gd toward the inner Galaxy and increases by a factor of ∼2-3 toward the Galactic center. One possible explanation for this result is that the ratio of H2 column density to 12CO intensity is lower in the Galactic center region than in the Galactic disk.","Dust, extinction; Infrared: ISM: continuum; ISM: molecules",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044253012

Further comparison of corrosion rates showed some spatial disagreement of the relative contributions to the individual corrosion processes, particularly for the New York site.

Using the ACM, the effects of the emission reduction on the annually estimated corrosion rates were modeled. The results show a beneficial reduction in regional corrosion rates estimated annually.

Seveal areas of concern are: 1. exposure of airport workers and urban residents to toxic chemicals emitted when the engines operate at low power (idle and taxi) on the ground; 2. contributions to urban photochemical air pollution of aircraft volatile organic and nitrogen oxides emissions from operations around airports; and 3. emissions of nitrogen oxides and particles during high-altitude operation. The environmental impact of chemicals emitted from jet aircraft turbine engines has not been firmly established due to lack of data regarding emission rates and identities of the compounds emitted. This paper describes an experimental study of two different aircraft turbine engines designed to determine detailed organic emissions, as well as emissions of inorganic gases. Emissions were measured at several engine power settings. Measurements were made of detailed organic composition from C1 through C17, CO, CO2, NO, NOx, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Measurements were made using a multi-port sampling pro be positioned directly behind the engine in the exhaust exit plane. The emission measurements have been used to determine the organic distribution by carbon number and the distribution by compound class at each engine power level. The sum of the organic species was compared with an independent measurement of total organic carbon to assess the carbon mass balance. A portion of the exhaust was captured and irradiated in outdoor smog chambers to assess the photochemical reactivity of the emissions with respect to ozone formation.

The images were obtained by cross-track scanning radiometers. Data images at nearinfrared wavelengths show frequent and readily apparent brightness features that are due to glory single scattering. The observations and subsequent analysis by radiative transfer calculations show that the glory is a significant feature of near-infrared solar reflectance from water clouds. Glory observations and calculations based on in-cloud microphysics measurements agree well. The most dramatic difference from the visible glory is that the scattering angles are significantly larger in the near infrared. The glory is also apparently more distinct in the near infrared than in the visible, as scattering size parameters are in a range that effectively produces a glory feature, and also there is less obscuration by multiplescattering reflectance because of absorption of radiation by droplets in the near infrared. For both the visible and the near infrared, the principal factors that wash out the glory are dispersion and, to a lesser degree, the effective radius of the cloud droplet-size distribution. The obscuration by multiple scattering in optically thick clouds is secondary. Rather than being a novelty, glory observations would be an accurate and unambiguous technique to sense the droplet size of water clouds remotely. © 1994 Optical Society of America.",,"cloud; glory; infrared; marine stratus; radiative transfer; Atmospheric optics; Electromagnetic dispersion; Infrared radiation; Light scattering; Droplet size distribution; Droplets; Glory single scattering; Marine stratus clouds; Clouds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028667859

Reaeration and photosynthesis are the oxygen sources, while respiration, sedimentary, and biochemical water column oxygen demand are the sinks of oxygen in the model. The lake classes are differentiated by surface area (As), maximum depth (Hmax), and trophic status expressed as Secchi depth (Zs). Because lake stratification is most important to lake oxygen dynamics, simulated DO characteristics are plotted in terms of a stratification parameter As/Hmax0.25 and Secchi depth Zs. Simulations provide DO profiles on a daily time scale. Specific DO characteristics of ecological and environmental interest are epilimnetic DO, hypolimnetic DO, DO gradient from surface to bottom, and DO minima and maxima. Specific results are as follows: Simulated mean daily and weekly DO values in the epilimnion of all lakes for both past and future climate scenarios are near saturation over the summer season. Hypolimnetic DO values depend strongly on lake morphometry, trophic status, and time throughout the summer season. Future climate conditions are specified as the historical records from 1955 to 1979, adjusted (monthly) by the 2 × CO2 GISS model output to account for doubling of atmospheric CO2. With this climate change, weekly averaged epilimnetic DO is projected to drop by less than 2 mg/liter, and will remain above 7 mg/liter throughout the open water season. The hypolimnetic DO reductions after climate change are on the order of 2-8 mg/liter. Periods of anoxia are longer by as much as 80 days.

This paper presents the results of a 39-month study on the effects of sewage sludge disposal and its abatement on feeding of three species in the New York Bight. Feeding variables were measured in winter flounder, red hake and American lobster at three sites along a gradient of sludge influence. Post-abatement changes in benthic habitats included reduced sediment total organic carbon (TOC) and metal contamination, and increased summer bottom water dissolved oxygen (DO) and changes in the abundances of some benthic infaunal species at the study sites. Statistically significant diet changes were only evident in winter flounder, however. The limited sample sizes and relatively high variability of the results for red hake and lobster gave the tests on the percentage of empty stomachs a relatively low power (1- β = < 0·20) for detection of change, or greater than 80% chance of incorrectly accepting the null hypothesis at a 95% confidence limit (and detectable effect size) even with percentage of empty stomach changes of up to 52% for these two species. There were, however, changes in the frequency of occurrence of certain artifacts or minor, pollution-sensitive prey in the diets that can be associated with sludge disposal abatement. The importance of these changes to predator health was not assessed. © 1994.",,"American lobster; red hake; sewage sludge; winter flounder; USA, New York, New York Bight; Homarus americanus; Pleuronectes americanus; Urophysis chuss; Animalia; Pleuronectiformes; Pleuronectoidei; Pseudopleuronectes americanus; Rexea solandri; Urophycis chuss; dissolved oxygen; metal; animal tissue; article; benthos; fish; flatfish; lobster; nonhuman; sediment; sewage disposal; sludge; stomach; total organic carbon; United States; water contamination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028163166

We investigate the conditions under which a detectable radio pulsar signal can be produced by the rapidly rotating neutron star in the quiescent phase of a SXRT. As the mass inflow rate toward the neutron star decreases during the decay of an outburst, the radius of the neutron star magnetosphere might expand beyond the corotation radius, inhibiting accretion onto the neutron star due to the ""centrifugal barrier."" Hence, the minimum observed accretion-induced X-ray luminosity at the end of an outburst provides constraints on the neutron star magnetic field, B, and spin period, P. Based on current measurements, SXRTs can lie in the region of the B-P diagram which is characteristic of recycled millisecond radio pulsars. If this were the case, the radio pulsar emission from a SXRT can resume only when the mass inflow rate from the companion star decreases by a few orders of magnitude below the ""centrifugal barrier"" threshold. The persistent emission (∼1033-1034 ergs s-1) detected in the quiescent state of a few SXRTs might result from accretion onto the neutron star surface, from accretion down to the magnetospheric radius (if the ""centrifugal barrier"" is closed), or from the neutron star cooling. In the latter two cases, the possibility of one of these SXRTs turning on as a radio pulsar is far more likely.","Accretion, accretion disks; Pulsars: general; Stars: general; X-rays: stars",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12044257867

We are interested in the molecular changes responsible for the novel expression pattern of C4 genes and are focussing on phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase) of the genus Flaveria. The C4 isoform of PEPCase in the C4 plant F. trinervia is encoded by the ppcA subgroup of the PEPCase gene family and is abundantly expressed in the mesophyll cells of leaves. The orthologous ppcA genes of the C3 plant F. pringlei are only weakly expressed and their transcripts do not accumulate in a leaf-specific manner but, rather, are present in all plant organs. To answer the question whether the differences in the expression levels of the ppcA genes from F. pringlei and F. trinervia are caused by changes in the 5′ upstream regions of the genes or by C4-specific trans-regulatory factors, varying parts of the 5′ flanking region of the ppcA1 genes of both species were fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and inserted in the tobacco genome. GUS expression analysis of transgenic plants revealed that the level of expression of the Flaveria ppcA1 genes are recapitulated in the heterologous C3 plant tobacco. Hence, the 5′ upstream region of the ppcA1 gene of F. trinervia contains regulatory cis-elements that are responsible for the C4-specific, abundant expression of this gene. These sequences are located upstream of position -500 relative to the transcription initiation site. Interestingly, the ppcA1 promoter (position -2118 to position + 66) of F. trinervia is specifically active in palisade parenchyma cells of transgenic tobacco, suggesting that the mesophyll specificity of this promoter is partially maintained in tobacco. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.","Flaveria Mesophyll-specific expression; Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase C4 photosynthesis; Promoter analysis","phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; unclassified drug; beta glucuronidase; hybrid protein; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; plant DNA; article; evolution; gene expression; histochemistry; mesophyll; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant; priority journal; promoter region; tobacco; genetic transformation; genetics; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; transgenic plant; Flaveria; Flaveria trinervia; Nicotiana tabacum; Base Sequence; DNA, Plant; Glucuronidase; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase; Plants; Plants, Genetically Modified; Plants, Toxic; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tobacco; Transformation, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028170776

Rhode et al. (1981) concluded that sulfate production rates were highly non-linear functions of sulfur dioxide emission rates. Their modelling study used an HOx termination mechanism for the HO-SO2 reaction in the gas-phase. Stockwell and Calvert (1983) determined that one of the products of the overall reaction of HO with sulfur dioxide was an HO2 radical. The National Research Council (1983) using a version of the Rhode et al. (1981) model modified to include HO2 production from the HO-SO2 reaction concluded that sulfate production becomes much more linear with respect to reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions. However, the cause of this increased linearity was not explained by the National Research Council report. It is demonstrated that the increased linearity is due to the coupling of gas-phases and aqueous phase chemistry.

Carbon dioxide emissions resulting from car, electricity and gas use were computed and household actions which could reduce CO2 emissions were addressed. Preliminary analysis of the results indicates that householders in this area are aware of, and concerned about, the greenhouse effect, although their understanding of its causes is often poor. Many appreciate the contribution of cars, but are unclear about the relative importance of other household activities. Carbon dioxide emissions from the three sources examined averaged 21·2 tonnes/year per household and 7·4 tonnes/year per person. Electricity was the largest contributor (8·6 tonnes/year), cars the next largest (7·7 tonnes/year) and gas third (5·0 tonnes/year) per household. Emissions varied considerably from household to household. There was a strong positive correlation between availability of economic resources and household CO2 output from all sources. Carbon dioxide production, particularly from car use, was greater from households which were more distant from a railway station, and from larger households, and numbers of children in the household had little effect on emissions. There were also some economics of scale for households containing more adults. Understanding the causes of the greenhouse bore little relation to change in CO2 emissions; being concerned about it was associated with a small reduction; but actual actions to reduce car use and household heating, however motivated, produced significant reductions. © 1994 Academic Press.

The occurrence of hydrocarbons indicates that they were not derived either from laboratory contamination or from field contamination; these compounds found in the mantle-derived rocks are called here ""mantle hydrocarbons."" The existence of hydrocarbons correlates with petrogenesis. For example, peridotite cumulates produced by magmatic differentiation lack hydrocarbons whereas peridotite xenoliths derived from the mantle contain them. Gas Chromatographic-mass spectrometric records of the mantle hydrocarbons resemble those of aliphatics in meteorites and in petroleum. Features of the hydrocarbons are that 1. (a) the mantle hydrocarbons reside mainly along grain boundaries and in fluid inclusions of minerals 2. (b) heavier isoprenoids such as pristane and phytane are present 3. (c) δ13C of the mantle hydrocarbons is uniform (about -27%.). Possible origins for the mantle hydrocarbons are as follows. 1. (1) They were inorganically synthesized by Fischer-Tropsch type reaction in the mantle. 2. (2) They were delivered by meteorites and comets to the early Earth. 3. (3) They were recycled by subduction. The mantle hydrocarbons in the cases of (1) and (2) are abiogenic and those in (3) are mainly biogenic. It appears that hydrocarbons may survive high pressures and temperatures in the mantle, but they are decomposed into lighter hydrocarbon gases such as CH4 at lower pressures when magmas intrude into the crust; consequently, peridotite cumulates do not contain heavier hydrocarbons but possess hydrocarbon gases up to C4H10. © 1994.",,"carbon; hydrocarbon; mineral; petroleum; silicate; silicon dioxide; article; astronomy; basalt; biogenesis; geology; granite; Biogenesis; Carbon Isotopes; Earth (Planet); Evolution, Chemical; Evolution, Planetary; Geology; Hydrocarbons; Minerals; Petroleum; Silicates; Silicon Dioxide; Fischer-Tropsch type reaction; hydrocarbon; mantle rock; ophiolite; peridotite; subduction recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028184547

When the system load changes, cost and emissions also change to values which depend on the objective function to be minimized and in turn on the weighting factors assigned to each function in the case of multi objective optimization. This requires a new optimal solution for any change in system load. A dispatcher may need to change a weighting factor in order to reduce emissions or cost from one case to another which requires a complete solution of the problem any time a change takes place. However, if the changes in system loading are not too large or a small change in a weighting factor or emissions constraint is needed, then a sensitivity analysis may be used without losing significant accuracy to change the state of the system in real time which has the advantage of requiring less time than a complete optimal solution. © 1993 IEEE",,"Electric load flow; Electric power systems; Industrial emissions; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Multi objective optimization; Power flow; Weighting factors; Electric loads",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028370801

To demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, a fundamental study of the evaluation of the optimal generation mix for controlling CO2 emissions is indicated. Furthermore, by using a parametric analysis which considers load characteristics as parameters, a general trend for the optimal generation mix which is affected by controlling CO2 can be derived. The proposed method is based on an optimization method known as simulated annealing. In the method, solutions in a generation mix problem are equivalent to state of a physical system, and the cost of a solution is equivalent to the energy of a state. The proposed method can easily accommodate not only CO2 emissions but also many practical constraints of generation expansion planning, such as integer solutions of unit capacities, condition of existing units, and so on. Case studies with various annual load patterns (combinations of annual load factors and the shapes of annual load duration curve) are presented and discussed. Consequently, a general trend for selecting generation technologies that should be added to a power system is derived, i.e., a useful guideline for studying generation expansion planning under controlling CO2 emissions can be provided.

The mechanistic aspects of the solid state decomposition were similar to those found with the solution decomposition, but the kinetic aspects were quite different, since the rate constant, kobs, found for the solid state reaction, was two orders of magnitude lower than the one found for the solution reaction. The decomposition reaction of cobalt carbonyls is primarily governed by diffusion. The diffusion of the cobalt carbonyls through a certain medium is strongly dependent on the viscosity of that medium. In a solution containing a polymeric system, the viscosity is a dominant property, since it is directly proportional to the concentration of the polymer in the solution. Therefore, the solution and solid state decompositions may be viewed as two extreme cases, in which the only variable is the viscosity of the polymeric solution. In the solution case, in the absence of polystyrene, the viscosity of the solution is essentially the viscosity of pure hydrocarbon solvent (toluene), while in the solid state case, the viscosity of the composite polystyrene film (the film containing the cobalt carbonyl complex) may be approximated as the viscosity of solid polystyrene just before its melting point. There are no studies to date which examine the effect of the viscosity of the solution of the cobalt carbonyl complexes on their thermal decomposition reaction in an inert atmosphere. Therefore, a study of the variation of the rate constants of the decomposition reactions as a function of the concentration of the polystyrene component in the cobalt carbonyl toluene solutions was undertaken. The reaction rates decreased with increasing polystyrene concentration, but only after a critical polymer concentration, c*, which is the coil overlap concentration, was reached. The data obtained are reported here with conclusions concerning the mechanism of the thermal decomposition reaction of cobalt carbonyl complexes to produce zero-valent cobalt particles. © 1994.","Carbonyl complexes; Cobalt complexes; Kinetics and mechanism; Thermal decomposition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001568642

A flow-through plant enclosure method was used to measure the emission flux rates from these species; the plant limb or whole plant was flushed with clean air just prior to hydrocarbon sampling. Samples of the plant emissions were collected on Tenax GC or Tenax GC-Carbosieve S-I1 cartridges and analysed by gas chromatography- Fourier transform infrared-mass spectrometry (GC-FTIR-MS). Quantifiable biogenic emissions from two blue oak specimens consisted only of isoprene, with an average emission rate of 8.4 μg g-1 dry biomass h-1. Emission rates (above the detection of about 0.05 μg-1 h-1) from two foothill pine specimens consisted mostly of α-pinene; an average emission rate of 0.64 μg-1 h-1 of α-pinene was observed. The tarweed species emitted both α- and β-pinenes, along with other terpene and oxygenated species, some of which have been tentatively identified. The emission rates of biogenic hydrocarbons from foothill pine and blue oak species as determined in this study make these species potentially significant contributors to summertime VOC levels in the San Joaquin Valley of California, based on vegetation classification data and the predominant summer meteorology. © 1994.","biogenic emission; emission rate; isoprene; terpene; VOC (volatile organic compounds)","Biogas; Forestry; Hydrocarbons; Organic compounds; Biogenic emission; Forest vegetation; Hardwood forest; Pine; Terpene; Emission spectroscopy; hydrocarbon; isoprene; terpene; volatile organic compound; air monitoring; air pollution; article; biomass; gas chromatography; higher plant; infrared spectroscopy; pine; priority journal; rural area; united states; biogenic emission; blue oak; isoprene; terpene; volatile organic compound; USA, California, San Joaquin Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028410957

Development of an international environmental regime for climate change is still in an embryonic state with a process-oriented Framework Convention with few commitments having been signed by 156 states including Australia at United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in June 1992. Australia ratified the convention on 31 December 1992 being the eighth nation to do so. The convention came into force 90 days after 50 nations ratified it in March 1994. As a developed country party to the convention, Australia is expected to aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 and to report on progress towards such stabilisation in the meantime. This article examines Australian policy development to date, including the National Greenhouse Response Strategy released in December 1992, and discusses the apparent barriers to achieving the convention's stabilisation goal for Australia. It is argued that factors including scientific uncertainty, the long-term policy horizon of decades and political will, together with Australia's economic dependence on the energy sector, could result in greenhouse policy inertia during the remainder of the 1990s. For the future, it is recommended that more specific greenhouse mitigation and adaptation policy guidelines, including priorities for implementation for the 1990s, should be developed to prevent policy inertia. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000101748

They are excited in the 500-800 nm range and have large extinction coefficients which make them good candidates for sensitive immunosensor applications. We evaluated three of these dyes (Cy3, Cy5, and Cy5.5) in a direct fluoroimmunoassay on evanescent wave fiber optic biosensors. The biosensors differed in laser excitation sources and emission filters in order to accommodate dye requirements. The assay consisted of rabbit anti-goat IgG immobilized fiber probes being exposed to fluorophorelabelled goat IgG (gIgG). Upon binding of the dye-conjugated protein to the fiber, a signal was generated. When using the 514 nm laser device, Cy3-gIgG gave a substantially larger signal than TRTTC-gIgG. On the 650 nm laser device, CyS-gIgG provided very good signal, while that for Cy5.5 was moderate. Cy5.5 produced an excellent response on the 670 nm laser device. Use of these dyes provides a mechanism for improving the fiber optic biosensor by changing the excitation/emission to a region of low background for clinical and environmental samples. © 1994 SPIE.

Later on it was shown, that a local contamination of mutton from these sources was also to occur. As the consumption of mutton by the general Dutch population is negligible, that finding will not cause any significant additional exposure. On the other hand, one can predict a potential problem for a subpopulation with a significant intake of mutton, such as Dutch inhabitants of foreign origin. To investigate that issue, a food consumption survey with adult Turkish men and women was carried out by the Agricultural University, Wageningen. At the same time the concentration of (i)-TEQ in mutton from animals raised near incinerators and from background area was determined by the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven. The original data from the food consumption survey were used to calculate the intake of (i)-TEQ and (PCB)-TEQ by the Dutch Turks, applying levels of dioxins and furans, and planar PCBs in food items from a previous study with the general Dutch population. From the individual intake figures the median intake and its 95th percentile for adult Turks was computed. The results showed a median daily intake of 2,3,7,8 chlorine substituted dioxins and furans of 84 pg (i)-TEQ (95%: 171), equivalent with 1.13 pg (i)-TEQ/kg.day (95%: 2.32). For planar PCBs the figures were 110 pg (PCB)-TEQ (95%: 221), equal to 1.48 pg (PCB)-TEQ/kg.day (95%: 2.99). It was concluded, that these figures are similar to the results from the previous study with the general Dutch population. However, it was shown that there are distinct differences between the Dutch Turks and the general population for the contribution of the various categories of food item to the exposure. A scenario analysis showed an exceeding of the TD1 of 1% of the adult Dutch Turks, if mutton was contaminated with 13 pg TEQ/g.fat and 5% for mutton with 18 pg TEQ/g.fat. Levels up to 18 pg (i)-TEQ/g.fat were determined, and as background levels are about 2 pg (PCB)-TEQ, and as incinerators do also emit planar PCBs the total dioxins and related compounds in mutton will be higher then 20 pg TEQ. So, local contamination of mutton could have unacceptable consequences for the Dutch Turks. As a result of the contamination of cow's milk fat near incinerators measures to reduce emission of (i)-TEQ are forced by law. These measures will reduce concentrations of dioxins and related compounds in mutton at the same time. Thus, controlling major sources of exposure for the general population will also be effective for the exposure of Dutch Turks. © 1994.",,"2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; milk fat; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; air pollution; article; bioaccumulation; Denmark; food contamination; food intake; human; incineration; meat; milk; risk assessment; sheep; Animalia; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028097969

Our intent is to critique the elastic predictions, especially the mode conversion and displacement closure oscillation features of the elastic theory. A simple physical picture is developed based on a crack stability diagram, using two sets of stress intensity axes. The first set is the normal applied stress intensity K and the second is a local stress intensity factor k, defined to describe the physics of the core region. The Griffith condition and dislocation emission criterion are defined in terms of the local k, and its associated effective core size parameter. Unfortunately, the physical core size is not a unique parameter in the problem, but varies directly with the amount of shear in the core. Thus, the effective core size for the Griffith condition is different from that for dislocation emission. In each case, the effective core size is much smaller than the physical core size, which means that the mode shift at the crack tip is considerably larger than would be expected on the basis of linear elasticity. However, with appropriately defined effective core size parameters, the Griffith condition is well satisfied, and the emission criterion based on the Rice unstable-stacking-fault condition is also surprisingly well satisfied in the mode-II emission configuration. The crack is found never to exhibit displacement oscillations, in part, because of the necessary condition that the Griffith condition be satisfied at the crack tip, and in part because the amount of shear in the core is limited by dislocation emission. © 1994 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0011281274

It lacks ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39) holoenzyme, and accumulates only a small amount of the chloroplast-encoded large subunit. Pulse/chase experiments revealed that large subunits and nuclear-encoded small subunits are synthesized at normal rates. Because the mutant strain displayed uniparental inheritance and failed to complement a known chloroplast rbcL gene mutant strain, the 28-7J rbcL gene was cloned and sequenced to identify the new mutation. A single base change was found that causes large-subunit arginine-217 to be replaced by serine. This substitution occurs within α-helix 2 of the α/β-barrel active site. When photosynthesis-competent revertants were selected from mutant 28-7J, revertant R14-A was found to contain a second mutation within the rbcL gene. This intragenic suppressor mutation, named SI4-A, causes alahine-242 to be replaced by valine within β-strand 3. Holoenzyme from the R14-A double-mutant strain was found to have a 51% reduction in the CO2/O2 specificity factor, primarily due to a 91% decrease in the Vmax of carboxylation. The Km for ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate was increased 2-fold. Although the mutant substitutions are separated by 24 residues within the primary structure, they are close to each other in the tertiary structure. In fact, the substituted residues are also close to lysine-201, which must be carbamylated and coordinated with Mg2+ to activate the enzyme. Although the R14-A double-mutant enzyme does not have dramatic alterations in activation, the position of the carbamylated lysyl residue within the active site may account for the difference between carboxylation and oxygenation transition-state stabilization. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

The HI phase structure is considered as a useful model for small mixed detergent/phospholipid micelles. Formation of such mixed micelles is an obligatory step in the investigation of biological membranes and membrane proteins. Both the phospholipid 31P NMR chemical shift anisotropy and the 2H NMR quadrupole splittings can be observed in the hexagonal mesophase, in contrast to micelles where motional averaging precludes the direct observation of residual chemical shift or quadrupolar tensors. The 2H NMR spectra were evaluated in terms of carbon-deuterium bond order parameter profiles. The order profiles obtained in the lamellar detergent/phospholipid mixtures were significantly different from the corresponding profiles in the mixed detergent/phospholipid HI phase. In the lamellar phase, an increasing proportion of C12E8 led to a significant reduction in the absolute magnitude of the individual order parameters, whereas in the HI phase the order parameters remained relatively constant over a broad range of detergent/ phospholipid molar ratios. It was also shown by 31P and 2H NMR that the interfacial segments of the phospholipid (the glycerol backbone and the headgroup dipole) assume an almost identical conformation in the lamellar and in the HI phase. Average chain lengths and mean cross-sectional areas were derived from the order parameter profiles and interpreted in terms of geometrical properties of the hexagonal and lamellar phase aggregates. Furthermore, measurements at different temperatures yielded an estimate of thermal expansion coefficients of the phospholipid acyl chains in the different phases. It is concluded that addition of detergent to lamellar phospholipids results in increasing packing constraints which are eventually relieved by a lamellar → HI transition. These packing constraints are discussed in terms of the molecular shape concept and with reference to statistical mechanical models of chain packing in bilayers, HI-structures, and small micelles. © 1994 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000780475

Rotational coherence transients observed for these species, spaced by 2.5-4.4 ns, are consistent with the n-alkane chain oriented parallel to the long axis of perylene and placed 3.6 Å above its surface. In contrast, the 1-chloropentane and 1-fluoropentane complexes of perylene both exhibit three conformational isomers (α,β,γ) in the electronic ground state. Rotational coherence experiments have measured the structures of these different species in the S1 state, via 000 excitation, proving the existence of three distinct isomers in each case. Dispersed emission spectra following vibronic excitation at 355 cm-1 (A 01) indicate in each case that the y structure relaxes to the a form. Knowledge of the structures of the different forms provides a basis to identify the photoisomerization trajectories. Rotational coherence spectroscopy (RCS) was also used to examine the structures following vibronic excitation. The n-alkane complexes each revealed at least one prominent recurrence transient, showing that vibronic excitation and subsequent vibrational redistribution processes do not necessarily cause rapid rotational dephasing. Similarly, an appreciable degree of rotational coherence persisted into the nanosecond domain for the α and β isomers of the fluoropentane and chloropentane complexes. On the other hand, loss of the γ form was confirmed via the RCS traces, since there were no recurrences for 355 cm-1 excitation. In this way, RCS measurements following vibronic excitation can provide a means to probe conformational stability. © 1994 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001054113

A generalized vapor pressure equation for heavy hydrocarbons. Fluid Phase Equilibria, 96: 19-31. Pitzer's acentric factor is widely used in physical property estimations; one important area is that of generalized vapor pressure correlations. Since Pitzer's acentric factor is defined in terms of the vapor pressure at a reduced temperature equal to 0.7, using this approach to generalize a vapor pressure equation gives excellent accuracy at reduced temperatures between 0.7 and 1.0, but predicts vapor pressures less accurately at lower reduced temperatures. To improve the vapor pressure prediction of hydrocarbons at low reduced temperatures, the definition of the acentric factor is re-examined and a modified acentric factor is proposed. Two sets of generalized vapor pressure equations are presented, with Pitzer's acentric factor and the modified acentric factor, respectively, as the third corresponding states parameter. These two equations are applied from the triple point to the critical point. Both correlations give more accurate vapor pressure predictions than the Lee-Kesler (1975) 2 2 Lee, B.I. and Kesler, M.G., 1975. AIChE J., 21: 510-527. correlation, especially at low reduced temperatures, with the correlation using the modified acentric factor as the third parameter being the most accurate. Additionally, an internally consistent approach is proposed for estimating the normal boiling point, critical temperature and critical pressure of petroleum fractions using a single low temperature vapor pressure data point. The procedure proposed uses either correlation from this work and gives an accurate estimation of the normal boiling point and acentric factor for heavy petroleum fractions for use in equations of state. © 1994.","Generalized; Hydrocarbons; Method; Theory; Vapor pressure","Petroleum distillates; Phase transitions; Physical properties; Thermodynamics; Vapor pressure; Petroleum fractions; Pitzer's acentric factor; Vapor pressure equation; Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028426596

The PCR‐amplified CA4H open reading frame was inserted into pYeDP60 under the transcriptional control of a galactose‐inducible artificial promoter. Engineered S. cerevisiæ strains producing human P450 reductase or normal or overproduced amounts of yeast P450 reductase were transformed to express recombinant CA4H. When grown on galactose, yeast cells produced CA4H holoprotein bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as judged from the reduced iron/carbon monoxide difference spectrum centered at 452 nm and from typical cinnamate 4‐hydroxylase activity upon coupling with the different P450 reductases and NADPH. Some CA4H protein was found also addressed to the yeast mitochondria but as a low‐activity form. The spectral and kinetic characterizations of the yeast‐produced CA4H in different redox protein environments are presented using both assays on yeast microsomal fractions and bioconversions on living cells. Results indicate that the microsomal system constituted by the overexpressed yeast P450 reductase and CA4H is characterized by a 1:1 coupling between NADPH oxidation and cinnamate hydroxylation and by one of the highest turnover numbers reported for an NADPH‐dependent P450 reaction. Based on spectral perturbation and inhibition studies, coumarate appeared to have no detectable affinity for the enzyme.

The first of these is concerned with using highly deviated drilling to access larger reservoir volumes from fewer platforms, whereas the second aims at employing drill pipes more efficiently, i.e. close to their fatigue limits. This paper presents the results of a work programme carried out at University College London aimed at producing hardware and software for automated monitoring of cyclic loading of oilfield drill pipes. The system consists of an automated drill pipe tagging, local monitoring, and system analysis package to predict, measure, and analyze cyclic loading in drill strings. Although no economic analysis has been carried out, it is believed that drilling companies may be able to reduce operating risks and maintenance costs significantly by utilizing such a system. The results achieved in preliminary tests are shown to be promising and indicate that a working drill floor based system should deliver substantial benefits in the long term.",,"Automation; Fatigue of materials; Loads (forces); Maintenance; Monitoring; Offshore drilling; Offshore oil fields; Oil field development; Risks; Cycle counting; Cyclic loading; Drill strings; Fatigue damage; Pipe deployment; Tagging; Drill pipe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028464083

Selected control strategies can subsequently be examined with a more complex model. The model is one component of an ozone management system, the regional ozone decision model (RODM), designed to examine the costs and environmental consequences of alternate ozone abatement strategies. The model was developed by systematic simplification of a detailed photochemical model. At each step of the simplification, the simplified model was tested against observations and against results from the detailed model. The first major simplification was the introduction of a highly parameterized chemistry mechanism, originally developed by Azzi et al. (1992 Proc. 11th Int. Clean Air Conf., 4th Regional IUAPPA Conf.). This modification resulted in a factor of 5 improvement in the computational efficiency of the model. The model with the simplified chemistry was then tested by applying it to a photochemical oxidant episode in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Further improvements in computational speed and efficiency were obtained by uncoupling the chemistry from the transport of VOC and NOx. © 1994.","age; computational efficiency; decision analysis; GRS mechanism; ozone; regional ozone management; Semi-empirical photochemical model; uncoupled transport and chemistry","application; development; nitrogen oxide; ozone modelling system; volatile organic compound; Air pollution control; Chemistry; Costs; Decision theory; Efficiency; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Testing; Volatile organic compounds; Age; Computational efficiency; Regional ozone decision model; Semi empirical photochemical model; Simplified ozone modeling system; Uncoupled transport and chemistry; Ozone layer; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; article; mathematical model; photochemistry; priority journal; Atmosphere; Ozone; Photochemical Model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028669075

It was found that an initial B/C coverage ratio of at least 2 3 is required to completely remove the carbon layer indicating that B2O3 is reduced by carbon at temperatures above 1050 K according to the reaction: B2O3 + 3C → 2B + 3CO.

The particular emphasis on sulfur dioxide (SO2) will require utilities to limit emissions to a specific number of tons per year allocated to the generating units in that utility. The first phase takes effect in January 1995, and includes only the largest SO2emitters. Phase 2 begins in January 2000, and will cover virtually all power plants. The constraints on emissions will be implemented by an allowance program: An allowance represents one ton of SO2discharged into the atmosphere. The number of allowances consumed in one year must not exceed the number owned by that utility. Utilities will receive allowances from the EPA each year, and they can obtain allowances from a third-party source. Any leftover allowances may be held for future use. In light of these new environmental protection requirements, a new look must be taken at utility operating practices and, therefore, at the software tools used to implement those practices.

By virtue of its design, the agglomerator is, in principle, a tubular electrostatic precipitator. The agglomeration mechanism is based on the fact that the electrically conductive soot particles accumulate at the collecting electrode of the agglomerator as flake-like structures. These are re-entrained when they exceed a certain size. The process of agglomeration can therefore be divided into three steps, i.e. particle transport, formation of agglomerates and emission. In order to assess the efficiency of the agglomerator, a measuring methodology has been developed which allows the determination of the size distribution of the soot particles over the range 17 nm to 40 μm. Investigations carried out in connection with this work show that the proportion of particles bound in agglomerates depends essentially upon the operating level of the engine. Depending on the various conditions employed, more than 90% of the particle mass may be bound in agglomerates whose sizes exceed 3 μm. With increasing engine load, the proportion of agglomerates decreases to ca. 40%. Varying the gas volume flow at a constant engine operating level demonstrates that such a dependency on load is not related to residence time, i.e. low efficiency does not arise from insufficient particle transport, but appears to be associated with one of the subsequent stages of the agglomeration process. Details of these processes have not been investigated so far. The total collection efficiency achieved via this system varies between 43% and 87% according to the various operating states of the engine. This significant difference can be explained in terms of the dependence of agglomeration and agglomerate collection upon engine load and speed. © 1994.","Centrifugal separation; Cyclone; Diesel soot particles; Electrostatic agglomeration","Agglomeration; Centrifuges; Separation; Soot; Centrifuges; Cyclone separators; Dust collectors; Electrostatic separators; Particle size analysis; Particulate emissions; Soot; Diesel soot particles; Electrostatic agglomeration; Agglomeration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028534363

Design: Prospective, descriptive study. Setting: Animal laboratory at a university medical center. Subjects: Twenty anesthetized and mechanically ventilated piglets were cannulated with 18- gauge bone marrow needles at intraosseous sites and 22-gauge Teflon catheters in peripheral veins. A 22-gauge angiocath was placed in the right carotid artery of each subject. Drug kinetics were studied in the normovolemic and hypovolemic (acute bleeding of 25 mL/kg) states. Interventions: Sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg) was injected into each of the three intraosseous and one intravenous sites with simultaneous monitoring of end-tidal CO2. A 10- min period for stabilization was allowed between injections. Aliquots of 99mtechnetium were injected at randomly selected sites and blood samples were obtained at 1.5-sec intervals via carotid artery for radioactive counts. Experiments were repeated after withdrawal of 25 mL/kg of blood. Measurements and Main Results: Assessment by end-tidal CO2 monitoring after 1-mEq/kg injections of bicarbonate demonstrated a mean initial end-tidal CO2 increase at 12.8 secs and a mean maximal end-tidal CO2 increase of 8 torr (1.06 kPa), with no significant site differences noted. Radioactive tracer injections were detected in the carotid artery after 15.4 secs in normovolemic animals and after 21.4 secs in hypovolemic animals, with no significant site differences detected. The proportion of injected tracer at 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mins identified no significant differences between various intraosseous and intravenous sites. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated similar rapid transit and proportion of bicarbonate and radioactive tracers, reaching the central circulation from multiple intraosseous sites and a peripheral intravenous site. This finding suggests that adjustments in drug dosage may not be required, using various intraosseous locations as an alternative to peripheral intravenous drug therapy.","catheters, indwelling, intraosseous; critical illness; hemorrhagic shock; injection, intravenous; pediatrics; pharmacokinetics; radioactive tracers; resuscitation; vascular access ports","bicarbonate; indium 113m; pentetic acid; technetium 99m; animal experiment; article; artificial ventilation; blood sampling; carotid artery; catheterization; controlled study; critical illness; drug infusion; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; hypovolemic shock; indwelling catheter; intraosseous drug administration; intravenous drug administration; nonhuman; priority journal; radioactivity; resuscitation; swine; vascular access",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028352161

C-C bond forming reactions previously identified on these surfaces include carboxylic acid ketonization, aldol condensation, reductive carbonyl coupling, and alkyne cyclotrimerization. The surfaces were prepared in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and examined by AFM in air. Surfaces examined included the {011}-faceted surface, {114}-faceted surface, and argon-ion-bombarded surfaces, as well as the mechanically polished singlecrystal surface prior to treatment in UHV. The one unifying feature of all the images was their extreme flatness. Root-mean-square roughnesses were routinely less than 10 Å in 500 × 500 nm scans. These same scans showed the surfaces to have surface areas exceeding that of an ideal flat surface by no more than 1.2%. Images of the polished surface revealed a variety of surface features, including polishing scratches and particle-like features. The argon-ion-bombarded surface and the faceted surfaces were composed of large flat plateaus ranging in size from 21 to 75 nm. The size of the plateaus was essentially the same for the ion bombarded surface and the {011}-faceted surface. The {114}-faceted surfaced exhibited slightly smaller plateau regions than the other surfaces. The images indicate that argon-ion bombardment, while disordering the surface and causing significant composition changes, does not lead to observable morphological changes on this scale. The relative uniformity of the surfaces examined is consistent with the selectivity of carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions that have been shown to take place on these surfaces. The images also reveal how the surface topography on the scale of the plateau structures observed is only slightly changed during the transformation of the surface unit cell structure from the {011}- to the {114}-faceted surface. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

There are five bound excited states of molecular oxygen that correlate with two ground state, 3P, oxygen atoms. Of these, three are singlets, although the other two states (triplets) are closely associated with singlet oxygen processes, especially in the mesosphere. A weakly bound quintet state has been invoked, as well, in explaining some aspects of the physical chemistry of the singlet species. Of the three singlet states, the a1Δg is the most familiar. It has a low excitation energy, a long radiative lifetime, and is rather resistant to collisional deactivation in the gas phase. As a consequence, its chemistry has been susceptible to detailed study in the laboratory. These investigations, coupled with estimates of production rates, suggest that O2(a1Δg) is probably not important in initiating much chemical change in the lower atmosphere, at least in the gas phase; excited molecules dissolved in water droplets may promote chemical change under special circumstances. In the stratosphere and mesosphere, each of the bound excited states gives rise to characteristic emission features of the airglow, both by day and by night. The observational data, obtained from the ground, and from balloons, high-flying aircraft, rockets and satellites is surveyed as a background to examining the chemical and photochemical mechanisms by which the different states become excited. These mechanisms clearly differ by day and by night, and they also depend on the altitude from which the emission comes. The most intense feature of the oxygen dayglow, the Infrared Atmospheric Band, comes from O2(a1Δg) that is produced in the photolysis of ozone. Because dayglow measurements are sometimes used to derive ozone concentrations and altitude profiles in the atmosphere, the efficiency of production of the species in the photolysis of ozone is examined critically, and some unexpected laboratory findings are reported. The b1Σ+g state of oxygen is excited during the day largely by resonance scattering, although some is also populated by energy transfer from O(1D) to O2. At night, recombination of O(3P) atoms is the most likely source of excitation of all the states of oxygen. Laboratory experiments that bear on these processes are reviewed, and theoretical estimates of the partitioning of recombination events between the different states are presented. Direct recombination into the a1Δg and b1Σ+g states is unlikely to be efficient enough to produce the observed concentrations of these species, and some indirect process is thus implicated. Laser excitation experiments show that quenching of the three higher excited (ungerade) states of oxygen by O2 and, especially, N2, can generate O2(b1Σ+g) with high efficiency; similar experiments demonstrate explicitly that the quenching of O2(b1Σ+g) by the atmospheric gases yields O2(a1Δg). A consistent excitation scheme for the nightglow emissions is presented; this scheme also pays attention to the ""auroral green"" line produced by the 1S state of atomic oxygen, the intensities of which in the atmospheres of Earth and Venus provide some clues about the excitation of the molecular states. Finally, the laboratory studies are shown to indicate that the formation of excited molecular oxygen from vibrationally rich hydroxyl (OH) radicals is unlikely to be of major importance in the atmosphere. © 1994 VSP.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342515135

The role of water in the evolution of planetary atmospheres is discussed. As the atmospheres of the planets developed and modified the early climates of the planets, only the climate trajectory of Earth intercepted the water phase transitions near the triple point of water, thus allowing the full gamut of water forms to coexist. As a result, transitions between the water phases pervade the entire system and probably are responsible for the creation of a unique climate state. The interactions between the components of the climate system are enriched by the nonlinearity of the water phase transitions. The nonlinear character of the phase transitions of water suggests that the climate should be particularly sensitive to hydrological processes, especially in the tropics. Signatures of the nonlinearity are found in both the structure of the oceans and the atmosphere. Specific processes that determine the character of ocean‐atmosphere interaction, including the role of ambient water vapor and clouds, the selective absorption of radiation by the ocean, the distribution of total heating in the ocean‐atmosphere system, and the role of the flux of freshwater, are discussed in detail. Models of the ocean and atmospheric and oceanic data and models of the coupled system are used to perform systematic analyses of hydrological processes and their role in system interaction. The analysis is extended to consider the role of hydrological processes in the basic dynamics and thermodynamics of oceanic and atmospheric systems. The role hydrological processes play in determining the scale of the major atmospheric circulation patterns is investigated. Explanations are offered as to why large‐scale convection in the tropical atmosphere is constrained to lie within the 28°C sea surface temperature contour and how hydrological processes are involved in interannual climate variability. The relative roles of thermal and haline forcing of the oceanic thermohaline circulation are discussed. Hydrological processes are considered in a global context by the development of a conceptual model of a simple planetary system. The constancy and maintenance of the very warm tropical sea surface temperatures are seen to be critical for the stability of climate. However, within the confines of the simplicity of the theory, the climate system, dominated by hydrological processes, conspires to maintain the temperature of the tropical warm pools.

The active region of our laser consists of atomically precise quantum wires that form at the T-shaped intersections of 7 nm wide GaAs quantum wells grown along the (001) and, after an in situ cleave, along the (110) crystal axis. The origin of the quantum mechanical bound state is the relaxation of quantum well confinement at this intersection, which leads to an expansion of the electron and hole wavefunction into the larger available volume at the T-junction. The high degree of structural perfection achievable in this way allows the observation of stimulated optical emission from the lowest exciton state in optically pumped devices. The interpretation that the observed quantum wire response is due to exciton recombination is based on the near spectral constancy of the emission over almost three orders of magnitude in excitation power from low-power luminescence to a single-mode lasing line. The implied absence of bandgap renormalization effects suggests that the Mott density is never reached and indicates interesting new behaviour of excitons in 1D. In contrast, the quantum well photoluminescence peak indeed shifts to lower energies consistent with the notion that the 2D excitons ionize and a free electron-hole plasma forms.",,"Energy gap; Excitons; Ionization; Light emission; Molecular beam epitaxy; Photoluminescence; Plasmas; Quantum theory; Relaxation processes; Semiconducting gallium arsenide; Semiconductor quantum wells; Cleaved edge overgrowth; Electron hole plasma; Hole wavefunction; Mott density; Semiconductor lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028549770

The model is based on a few qualitative assumptions: (i) biomass is continuously distributed over depth; (ii)) the light gradient is one-dimensional and uni-directional; (iii) pkotosynthesis is positively related to the local light intensity; and (iv) biomass growth is governed by the carbon balance. By introducing the concept of ‘quantum return’, it is shown that growth can be quantified directly in terms of the light gradient. In monoculture, growth leads to a globally stable equilibrium, at which the light intensity at the bottom of the light gradient is reduced to a ‘critical light intensity’ I(out). I(out) is not affected by the background turbidity but negatively related to the light supply. When all species are similarly distributed over the light gradient, the outcome of competition can be inferred from this monoculture characteristic: the species with lowest I(out) will competitively exclude all other species. In contrast, spatial differentiation of the competitors may lead to a completely different situation: several species may co-exist, and the species with lowest I(out) may be competitively displaced by species with a better position in the light gradient. © 1994 Academic Press.

MAbF19 recognizes the fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell- surface glycoprotein not present in most normal tissues, but abundantly expressed by reactive stromal fibroblasts of epithelial cancers, including more than 95% of primary and metastatic colorectal carcinomas. Patients and Methods: 131I-mAbF19 was administered intravenously to 17 patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma who were scheduled for resection of localized metastases or insertion of hepatic artery catheter for regional chemotherapy. Seven to 8 days before surgery, patients received 131I- mAbF19 at three dose levels, with at least four patients entered at each level. Results: No toxicity associated with intravenous 131I-mAbF19 administration was observed. Tumor images were obtained on planar and single- photon emission tomography (SPECT) scans in 15 of 17 patients with hepatic metastases, tumor-infiltrated portal lymph nodes, and/or recurrent pelvic disease. The smallest lesion visualized was 1 cm in diameter. The optimal time for tumor imaging was 3 to 5 days after 131I-mAbF19 administration. The use of image registration techniques allowed precise anatomic localization of 131I-mAbF19 accumulation. Immunohistochemical analysis of biopsy tissues showed expression of FAP in the tumor stroma (but not in normal liver) in all patients studied and confirmed that the FAP-positive tumor stromal fibroblasts were interposed between the tumor capillaries and the malignant colon epithelial cells. At the time of surgery, tumor-to-liver ratios up to 21:1 and tumor-to-serum ratios up to 9:1 were obtained. The fraction of the injected 131I-mAbF19 dose per gram tumor (%ID/g tumor) localized to hepatic metastases at the time of surgery ranged from 0.001% to 0.016%. Conclusion: The FAP tumor fibroblast antigen is highly expressed in primary and metastatic colorectal carcinomas and shows limited expression in normal adult tissues. This highly selective expression pattern allows imaging of colorectal carcinoma lesions as small as 1 cm in diameter on 131I- mAbF19 scans. Because of the consistent presence of FAP in the stroma of epithelial cancers and the accessibility of FAP-positive tumor stromal fibroblasts to circulating monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), this study suggests possible diagnostic and therapeutic applications of humanized mAbF19 and mAbF19 constructs with novel immune and nonimmune effector functions.",,"cancer antibody; fibroblast activating factor; iodine 131; membrane protein; monoclonal antibody f19; monoclonal antibody f19 iodine 131; unclassified drug; adult; aged; antigen expression; article; cancer localization; clinical article; colon cancer; dose response; drug distribution; drug targeting; female; human; immunohistochemistry; intravenous drug administration; male; metastasis; priority journal; single photon emission computer tomography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028357623

According to the results from the multivariate analysis, the most important fuel parameters are: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) content, 90% distillation point, final boiling point, specific heat, aromatic content, density, and sulfur content.","Chemical characterization; Chemometrics; Exhaust emissions; Fuel impact; Multivariate data analysis; PAH; Regulated pollutants; Unregulated pollutants","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; aromatic compound; carbon monoxide; diesel fuel; gasoline; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sulfur; Ames test; chemical composition; conference paper; controlled study; density; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; multivariate analysis; particulate matter; pollution control; priority journal; receptor affinity; Sweden; temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028028444

Thus, these limbic structures may selectively participate in directing neuroimmune regulation. In order to assess the fundamental role of the LSA in neuroimmune regulation, we have evaluated the effects of neurotoxic septal lesions on various cell-mediated immune measures. Animals received stereotaxically guided bilateral infusions of KA (2.0 μg/μl) or physiological saline (SHAM) into the LSA. Following a 2-week recovery period, animals were sacrificed and the spleen cells analyzed for natural killer (NK) cell activity and T-cell responsiveness to mitogen (ConA) or to anti T-cell receptor mAb (R73). A separate group of LSA-lesioned animals were immunized with sheep red blood cells 4 days prior to harvesting the spleen for plaque forming cell (PFC) number determination and measurement of TNF-α secretion from splenic macrophages. The results indicate that rats with KA lesions in the LSA have significantly higher NK cell activity, significantly lower numbers of splenic PFCs, and significantly reduced TNF-α secretion from splenic macrophages, relative to controls. There was a statistical tendency (p < .1) for reduced T-cell lymphoproliferative responses to ConA stimulation in LSA-lesioned animals, relative to SHAMs. However, the T-cell lymphoproliferative response to specific activation via the T-cell receptor was not significantly different between lesioned and control groups. These results further demonstrate the importance of KA-sensitive LSA neurons in neuroimmunoregulation. Moreover, selective alterations of different components of the immune system are observed in LSA-lesioned animals, suggesting that the LSA is involved in the complex and differential regulation of immunity. © 1994 Academic Press, Inc.",,"concanavalin a; kainic acid; mitogenic agent; monoclonal antibody; t lymphocyte receptor; tumor necrosis factor alpha; animal cell; animal experiment; article; cellular immunity; controlled study; facilitation; female; hippocampus; humoral immunity; immune system; immunoregulation; limbic system; lymphocyte proliferation; macrophage; natural killer cell; nerve lesion; neuroendocrine system; neuroimmunology; nonhuman; plaque forming cell; priority journal; rat; septum pellucidum; sheep erythrocyte; spleen cell; t lymphocyte; Animal; Cell Death; Concanavalin A; Female; Hemolytic Plaque Technique; Kainic Acid; Killer Cells; Lymphocyte Activation; Macrophages; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Septum Pellucidum; Spleen; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028598438

Sequence comparisons show that T. koningii cbhl is identical to that of T. reesei with the exception of 6 bp-two causing silent substitutions in the coding region, three differing in one of the introns, and one in 5′-noncoding region. Thus, it should encode an identical CBHI to that of T. reesei despite the differences in morphological characters of the two species. Analysis of approximately 1.4 kb of the 5′ flanking region shows a number of surprisingly interesting putative regulatory features. There are no unusual features within about 600 bp upstream of the translation start ATG. However, prior to the 600-bp region, there are seven CAAT sequences, a number of direct and inverted repeats, and two C/T-rich regions. Also, there are five consensus 5′-(G/C)PyGGGG-3′ sequences that have been identified to be carbon catabolite repressor binding sites of Aspergillus nidulans CREA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae MIG1 repressors. The structural organization arround these consensus sequence regions is similar to those of A. nidulas alcR and alcA promoters. While the production of large amounts of CBHI by T. koningii upon induction apparently correlates with the large number of CAAT boxes in the 5′ upstream untranslated region of cbh1, the presence of five CREA/MIG1 repressor-binding consensus sequences in the region suggests the wide-domain carbon catabolite repression regulatory system that controls the A. nidulans ethanol regulon, and yeast GAL genes transcription might also be operative and responsible for regulation of T. koningii cbh1 transcription. © 1994 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.",,"cellulose 1,4 beta cellobiosidase; article; fungal genetics; gene expression regulation; gene sequence; gene structure; hyphomycetes; molecular cloning; nonhuman; priority journal; sequence homology; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Fungal; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Genes, Fungal; Glycoside Hydrolases; Molecular Sequence Data; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Restriction Mapping; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Trichoderma; Alca; Aspergillus; Emericella nidulans; Hyphomycetes; Hypocrea koningii; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Trichoderma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027976878

We present a Regional Ecosystem Simulation System (RESSys) which uses satellite data to define vegetation properties, topographic and soil data to define site characteristics, and a climate generator program to build a topographically sensitive microclimate map. We use a 150‐km2 mountainous forested watershed in Glacier National Park to test the consequences of modeling various ecosystems processes using different versions of RESSys with increasing simplification of the landscape: (1) spatial scaling generated using 30 m x 30 m Landsat Thematic Mapper data versus 1 km x 1 km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data for vegetation definition; (2) modeling hydrologic dynamics produced by using a topographic routing model versus a simple soil ‘bucket’ model; (3) variable landscape partitioning based on patterns of topographic complexity; and (4) representation of annual net primary productivity (ANPP) using an absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR) model. We evaluate results of these simulations by comparison with average values and areal distributions of photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, hydrologic outflow, and ANPP. Our primary goal is to test whether areal average flux of carbon and water can be scaled linearly over a complex landscape. We found that daily photosynthesis could be predictably estimated between modeling scales with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.89 to 0.99. ANPP was highly correlated among the modeling scales with maximum differences between ANPP prediction of ca. 0.5Mg C ha‐1 yr‐1. Evapotranspiration was similarly predictable between scales but was influenced by differences associated with hydrologic modeling. Hydrologic outflow was not highly correlated between different modeling scales as a function of the different hydrologic models used at different scales. 1994 IAVS ‐ the International Association of Vegetation Science","GIS; Hydrology; Modeling; Photosynthetic; Primary productivity; Radiation; Satellite data; Spatial scale","Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer; ecosystem simulation; GIS; hydrological dynamics; Landsat Thematic Mapper; landscape partitioning; photosynthetic active radiation; primary productivity; satellite data; spatial scaling; USA, Montana; USA, Montana, Glacier National Park",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028603016

Estimates from this Climate-Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (clamp) are both accurate (valid) and precise (repeatable). Application of clamp to fossil-leaf assemblages from western North America confirms that Eocene mean annual temperature (mat) was generally high (early Eocene mat ≈ 19°C at paleolat. 70°N and >27°C at paleolat. 45°N). Significant fluctuations (≈5-8°) in mat occurred during the Eocene. Each successive warm period was cooler than the preceding warm period. Mean annual range of temperature (mart) was generally low during the Eocene, especially at middle latitudes, but then markedly increased by ≈ 12-13°C at ≈33 Ma as mat decreased by ≈ 7-8°C. These changes at ≈ 33 Ma largely involved a decrease in cold-month mean temperature, which continued to decline into the early Miocene but then increased significantly into the mid-Miocene thermal optimum. Warm-month mean temperature changed little from the Eocene through the early Miocene; this parameter, however, markedly decreased at ≈ 13 Ma, which coincides with the growth of the east Antarctic ice sheet. clamp also indicates that the coastal region of western North America had significantly higher mat than interior regions such as the Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. These differences in mat appeared by, or during, the Eocene and indicate that much of the interior had high altitudes in the Paleogene. These inferences have a significant bearing on global circulation models proposed for Tertiary climates. © 1994.",,"angiosperm; climate change; leaf assemblage; palaeoclimate; Tertiary; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028193759

Secondly, the automotive industry, which is the refining industry’s highest value customer, is likely to seek to react to pressure to reduce tail-pipe emissions by seeking to set increasingly tight transportation fuel specifications. Thirdly, product quality improvement programs appear likely to migrate with increasing speed from the industrialized economies of the OECD to the industrializing economies of South East Asia and then to the developing countries, as concern over environmental standards globalize. Fourthly, there's a tendency for fragmentation of product qualities on a regional basis, e.g., reformulated gasoline in the US and city diesel grades in Scandinavia.

The magnitude of a control coefficient is approximately the percentage change in the flux that would result from a 1% rise in enzyme active site concentration. In plants grown at low CO2, leaves of different ages varied considerably in their photosynthetic capacities. In a saturating light flux and an ambient CO2 concentration of 350 μmol mol−1, the Rubisco control coefficient was about 0.7 in all leaves, indicating that Rubisco activity largely limited the assimilation flux. The Rubisco control coefficient for leaves grown at 350 μmol mol−1 CO2 dropped to about zero when the ambient CO2 concentration was raised to 800 μmol mol−1. In relatively young, fully expanded leaves of plants grown at high CO2, the Rubisco control coefficient was also about 0.7 at a saturating light flux and at the CO2 concentration at which the plants were grown (800 μmol mol−1). This apparently resulted from a decrease in the concentration of Rubisco active sites. In older leaves, however, the control coefficient was about 0.2. Because, on the whole, Rubisco activity still largely limits the assimilation flux in plants grown at high CO2, the kinetics of this enzyme can still be used to model photosynthesis under these conditions. The relatively high Rubisco control coefficient under enhanced CO2 indicates that the young sunflower leaves have the capacity to acclimate their photosynthetic biochemistry in a way consistent with an optimal use of protein resources.

A set of hut-lacZ transcriptional fusions was constructed and used to identify the cis-acting sites required for histidine induction and amino acid repression. Histidine induction was found to be primarily mediated by transcriptional antitermination at a palindromic sequence located immediately downstream of the first structural gene in the hut operon, hutP. High levels of histidine induction were observed only in hut-lacZ fusions which contained this palindromic sequence. The hutCI mutation, which results in constitutive expression of the hut operon, was sequenced and found to contain a GC to TA transversion located within the stem-loop structure. Transcription of hut DNA in vitro revealed that the palindromic structure functions as a transcriptional terminator with wild-type hut DNA but not with hutCI DNA. Two sites were found to be involved in amino acid repression of hut expression: (i) an operator, hutO(A), which lies downstream of the hut promoter, and (ii) the hut terminator. The rate of [14C]histidine uptake in amino acid-grown cells was sixfold lower than that seen in cells grown without amino acids.

Thermodynamic analyses show that the driving force of bainitic transformation increases with the reduction of the carbon content of carbon-depleted region and can overcome the shear energy resistance with carbon depleting to a certain level. And, the driving force of bainitic reaction is dependent upon the carbon content of carbon-depleted region, the average carbon content of the alloy and the transformation temperature whereas the shear energy barrier of bainitic formation is mainly determined by the aspect ratio of product phase. The model also deduces a prediction that the freshly-formed bainitic ferrite is with partial supersaturation of carbon, which increases smoothly with decreasing the reaction temperature. Finally, it is concluded that the shear formation of bainitic ferrite can be realized thermodynamically within the whole temperature range of bainitic reaction. © 1994, The Japan Institute of Metals.

By adaptively smoothing pixels in regions with small intensity fluctuations while preserving sharp edges, anisotropic diffusion works well in extracting boundaries for images which comprise smooth regions separated by discontinuities. This boundary information is incorporated into the reconstruction algorithm by means of space-variant simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) processes. To further reduce the noise effect and to improve boundary extraction, P(x) is defined in the wavelet domain. Wavelet transform (WT) decomposes x into subbands with distinctive characteristics, and each subband is modeled by a SAR process whose coefficients are determined according to the spatial features of the subband for a more accurate prior description.

The mean potentials for plasmas of oxygen, argon, and argon mixed with oxygen in the AECR were determined. These plasma potentials are positive with respect to the plasma chamber wall and are on the order of tens of volts. Electrons injected into the plasma by an electron gun or from an aluminum oxide wall coating with a very high secondary electron emission reduce the plasma potential as does gas mixing. A lower plasma potential in the AECR source coincides with enhanced production of high charged state ions indicating longer ion confinement times. The effect of the extra electrons from external injection or wall coatings is to lower the average plasma potential and to increase the neτ i of the ECR plasma. With sufficient extra electrons, the need for gas mixing can be eliminated or reduced to a lower level, so the source can operate at lower neutral pressures. A reduction of the neutral pressure decreases charge exchange between ions and neutrals and enhances the production of high charge state ions. An aluminum oxide coating results in the lowest plasma potential among the three methods discussed and the best source performance.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36448998654

PPy and PBpy have a rigidly linear rodlike structure as revealed by their showing a theoretically limiting ρv (degree of depolarization) value of 0.33, and they exhibit a large refractive index increment (Δn/Δc = 0.59 cm3 g-1) and a large refractive index of nd = 2.2. Stretching of polyvinyl alcohol) film containing the PPy or PBpy molecules in its surface region affords a polarizer which shows a dichroic ratio of 45. The PBpy molecules stand upright on a carbon substrate in a PBpy film vacuum deposited on the carbon substrate as revealed by electron diffractometry. On the other hand, PBpy molecules in a film vacuum deposited on a glass substrate are oriented in parallel with the surface of the glass substrate as revealed by analysis of optical second-harmonic generation from the PBpy film, which shows alignment of all the PBpy molecules attached to the glass substrate (1 × 1 cm) in a same direction: coordination of a PBpy molecule to the Si-O-H group is proposed to explain such orientation of the PBpy molecules. PPy exhibits fluorescence with a peak at 440 nm in a dilute solution (2 × 10-6 M monomer unit), whereas PPy shows an additional excimer-like emission at 550 nm in a saturated solution (0.5 M monomer unit) and PPy and PBpy films emit only the excimer-like emission at 550 nm. Picosecond time-resolved fluorescence also supports the excimer-like fluorescence. PPy, PBpy, and their alkyl derivatives are electrochemically reduced or n-doped more easily than poly(p-phenylene) and poly(thiophene-2,5-diyl), reflecting π-electron-deficient nature of the pyridine ring, and E0 values of -2.2 through -2.5 V vs Ag/Ag+ are observed for the polymers; the n-doping and its reverse reaction (n-undoping) are accompanied by a color change (e.g., yellow in the n-undoped state and blue in the n-doped state for PPy and PBpy). Chemically n-doped PPy and PBpy with sodium naphthalide have electrical conductivities of 1.1 × 10-1 and 1.6 × 10-1 S cm-1, respectively, as measured with compressed powder. On the contrary, PPy, PBpy, and their alkyl derivatives undergo p-doping neither electrochemically nor chemically (e.g., by treatment with AsF5), reflecting the π-deficient nature of the pyridine ring. PBpy and P6HexBpy form complexes with Ru(II), Ni(II), Ni(0), and Fe(III) species, and cyclic voltammetry of the PBpy-Ru complex reveals electron exchange between the coordinated Ru species, which is considered to occur through the π-conjugation system of the conjugated polymer ligand.

It is quite evident that measured values do not represent reality. Local plastic strain caused by residual stress concentrations round the blind hole has a main effect on the measuring error of welding residual stresses. This article presents a new method of calibrating strain coefficients A and B for eliminating influence of local plastic strain. In calibrating strain release coefficients A and B, calibrating stresses applied on the specimen were increased so that material round the blind hole produced local plastic deformation, ie coefficients A and B contained a component of the plastic strain. Numerial values of coefficients A and B were classified into four grades. Every grade coefficient contained a different quantity of the plastic strain for offseting the influence of the plastic strain round the blind hole. Test results have proved that by adopting these coefficients more satisfactory values for residual stresses can be obtained in practical engineering. The measuring average error in stainless steel (1Cr18Ni9Ti) reduces from 109% to 1.52%. The measuring average error in low carbon steel reduces from 54.69% to 3.21%. © 1994 Blackwell Publishing Ltd","blind hole drilling; plastic strain; strain release coefficients; Welding residual stresses","Calibration; Drilling; Geometry; Measurement errors; Mechanical variables measurement; Strain; Strength of materials; Stress analysis; Welding; Blind hole drilling; Material yield strength; Plastic strain; Strain release coefficients; Stress concentration; Tensile strength; Welding residual stresses; Residual stresses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028375722

It has existed in numerous forms on various types of vehicles, but the main emphasis has been directed at vehicles possessing a defined regular duty cycle where the required amount of energy storage can be accomplished without detracting from acceptable payload or passenger carrying capacity. To date, road vehicles most suited to electric drive have been those working within a well-defined, controlled, and limited range operation such as early morning milk or bread delivery trucks. Modern technology enables the extension of previous boundaries, and addresses environmental problems caused by high traffic density. Reasons for pursuing electric drive are not common when viewed from an international perspective, resulting in multiple approaches to resolve the various problems. Electric/hybrid vehicles present a significant opportunity to reduce emissions and improve system efficiency on urban start and stop cycles. A proliferation of approaches exist, and the challenge is to find the optimal system which will balance the technical vision and commercial feasibility. Automotive engineers have environmental and social responsibilities to children and future generations to be environmentally conscious and utilize knowledge and technologies to extract the most energy possible from the fuels available.

A reflection operator is defined and is used to create the images of electromagnetic fields and sources. The image fields satisfy Maxwell's equations, meaning that Maxwell's equations are invariant under the described reflection operations. By applying the reflection operations to media with reflection symmetry, the symmetry properties of the Stokes parameters, characterizing the polarization state of thermal emissions, are shown to agree with existing experimental data. The first two Stokes parameters are symmetric with respect to the reflection plane, while the third and fourth Stokes parameters have odd symmetry. In active remote sensing, the symmetry properties of the polarimetric scattering matrix elements of deterministic targets and the polarimetric covariance matrix elements of random media or distributed targets are examined. For deterministic targets, the cross‐polarized responses are odd functions with respect to the symmetry direction, whereas the copolarized responses are even functions. For distributed targets or random media, it is found that the correlations of copolarized and cross‐polarized responses are antisymmetric with respect to the reflection plane, while the other covariance matrix elements are symmetric. Consequently, in the cases of backscatter, the copolarized and cross‐polarized components are completely uncorrelated when the incidence direction is on the symmetry plane. The derived symmetry properties of polarimetric backscattering coefficients agree with the predictions of a two‐scale surface scattering model and existing sea surface HH and VV backscatter data. Finally, the conditions for a general type of media, i.e., bianisotropic media, to be reflection symmetric are examined.

We reexamine these results and discuss implications for future missions, the search for organics on Mars, and the possible health and engineering effects for human exploration. We conclude that further characterization of the reactivity of the martian regolith materials is warranted-although if our present understanding is correct the oxidant does not pose a hazard to humans. There are difficulties in explaining the reactivity of the Martian soil by oxidants. Most bulk phase compounds that are capable of oxidizing H2O to O2per the Gas Exchange Experiment (GEx) are thermally labile or unstable against reduction by atmospheric CO2. Models invoking trapped O2 or peroxynitrates (NOO−2) require an unlikely geologic history for the Viking Lander 2 site. Most suggested oxidants, including H2O2, are expected to decompose rapidly under martian UV. Nonetheless, we conclude that the best model for the martian soil contains oxidants produced by heterogeneous chemical reactions with a photochemically produced atmospheric oxidant. The GEx results may be due to catalytic decomposition of an unstable oxidizing material by H2O. We show that interfacial reaction sites covering &lt;1% of the available soil surfaces could explain the Viking Biology Experiments results. Due to the low concentration of reactive agents, the fact that they are probably composed of elements that are common in the soil, and their observed instability, it is unlikely that a sample return mission would be effective in identifying them. Methods for in situ characterization of the oxidant must be developed that are consistent with the dry state of the soil. Traditional terrestrial methods of characterizing the soil Eh are unsuitable. Alternative methods must be developed; one approach under development involves exposing a wide variety of materials to the martian regolith and monitoring their reactions. © 1994 by Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001147750

In this case, the X-ray emission consists of a 'soft' component, due to the slower wind, and a 'hard' component from the fast one. Such a double-peaked spectrum is also found in the case where, in addition to the shocked emitting gas, a stellar component with typical temperature ∼1 keV is present.

The optical coherence and quantum interference may lead to interesting statistical properties, such as narrower intrinsic linewidths and amplitude squeezing in inversionless lasers with coherently pumped atomic systems as active media. Here, we present an analysis of several three- and four-level coherently pumped atomic systems and show that steady-state lasing without inversion may be realized. In particular, lasing may be initialized from population inversion created by either incoherent or coherent pumping. As the laser intensity builds up, the excited-state population is depleted and the atomic coherence is enhanced. Eventually a transition from lasing with inversion to lasing without inversion occurs and the system evolves from an inversion laser into an inversionless laser. Such a transition is a general feature for a coherently pumped atomic system. We show that under suitable operating conditions, lasers without inversion may exhibit a nonlinear increase in the intensity and can be comparable in efficiency to conventional lasers with population inversion. Well above the threshold the inversionless laser may become amplitude squeezed and the maximum squeezing can be more than 50% below the shot-noise limit. There are two factors contributing to the noise reductions in the light output of these laser systems: first, the disappearance of the population inversion results in the depleted excited-state population, which reduces the spontaneous-emission noises; second, the fast coherent cycling of electrons driven by the coherent pump field and the lasing field leads to highly regulated absorption and emission processes.",,"Coherent light; Lasers; Light interference; Nonlinear optics; Optical pumping; Quantum theory; Atomic coherence; Coherent pump field; Coherently pumped atomic system; Conventional laser; Lasing field; Light amplification; Optical coherence; Quantum interference; Steady state lasing; Electron energy levels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028561417

We found that the Na 2p electron excitation essentially results from an L-shell vacancy transfer from the Ne 2p4(1D) at low Na coverages and from direct excitation in Na-Na symmetric collisions at high coverages.

Changes in the electronic states and surface distribution of sodium and silicon were followed in NaY and in Pt and Co containing NaY in the as prepared (AP), calcined (OX) and reduced (RE) states. Decoration of the zeolite surface by alumina detected, is attributed to the local processes during ion exchange. Introduction of Co2+ ions into the Pt-containing samples influences the electronic states of platinum both in calcined and reduced state. Pt° facilitates reduction of Co2+ ions and formation of bimetallic Pt-Co particles within the zeolite supercages could also be evidenced. The results support earlier TPR measurements indicating the presence of very small Pt-Co bimetallic particles for (IE) samples.

H3A 2A7, Canada","To characterize the influence of solution composition and specific dissolved components on the complex mechanism of calcite precipitation in seawater, a kinetic study was carried out in NaClCaCl2 solutions at a total ionic strength of 0.7 m. Experiments were conducted at 298.15 K and at four different CO2 partial pressures. A constant addition technique was used to maintain [Ca2+] at 10.5 mmol/ kg, while [CO2-3] was varied to isolate the role of this variable on the precipitation rate of calcite. Like in seawater solutions, calcite precipitation in the NaCl-CaCl2 solution is dominated by the following reaction: Ca2+ + CO2-3 ⇄ kb1 kf1CaCO3(s), Rx1 where kfl and kbl are, respectively, the forward and backward reaction rate constants. The net precipitation rate, R, can be described at any given PCO2 by R = kf1(aCa)na(aCO3) nb - kb1 or log (R + kb1) = log Kf1 + 3 log [CO2-3], where αi and ni are, respectively, the activity and partial reaction order of the species involved in the reaction, Kf1 = k1(aCa2+)na(γCO 2-3)3 and γ is the activity coefficient. The partial reaction order with respect to the CO2-3 ion concentration is, as in seawater solutions, equal to 3. Unlike seawater, however, the intercept, log Kf1, increases with increasing PCO2. This is interpreted as a contribution of the HCO-3 ion to the precipitation reaction. Its role was evaluated from the difference in the net rate R at every PCO2 and a fixed [CO2-3]. Solution of a system of nonlinear equations allowed us to determine that the partial reaction order with respect to the HCO-3 ion concentration is nearly equal to 2 and represented by the following reaction: Ca2+ + 2HCO-3 ⇄ kb2 kf2CaCO3(s) + H2CO3. Rx2 Under our experimental conditions (1.1 &lt; Ωc &lt; 8.3, where Ωc is the saturation state of the solution with respect to calcite), the calcite precipitation rate can be described by the following expression: R = Kf1[CO2-3]3 - kb1 + Kf2[HCO-3]2 - kb2(γH2CO3)αP CO2, where Kf2 = k2(aCa2+)nd(δHCO-3)2 and α is the solubility of CO2 in the experimental solution. We propose that, since the partial reaction order with respect to [CO2-3] is the same in both seawater and our experimental NaCl-CaCl2 solutions, the precipitation mechanism of pure calcite in the latter solution may be similar to that of a 8 mol% magnesian calcite from seawater. We suggest that Mg2+ and SO2-4ions, which are both major seawater constituents and calcite growth inhibitors, may not modify the precipitation mechanism, but decrease the rate constants of individual reactions. Finally, as opposed to our observations in the NaCl-CaCl2 solution, the lack of PCO2 dependence reported for calcite precipitation rates measured in seawater may be explained by a differential inhibition of the reactions participating in the overall growth process. © 1994.",,"calcite; calcium carbonate; chemical precipitation; kinetics; precipitation; reaction kinetics; seawater; solution composition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028563320

Traditional urban form has needed to make the most of its topology. Traditional buildings when necessary, have developed technologies that achieve additional comfort levels. Mechanisation however, has allowed building to drift away from its natural science base, to a free stylistic repertoire. This tendency has, over a period of time, caused some fundamental problems of performance. Consequentially the discipline of architecture needs to broaden, to allow it to recover its natural science base. To achieve this the design team must be more integrated from the earliest stages of design. Clients must give the team additional support during these first stages. Most importantly government must enact clear legislative requirements to ensure that energy efficient solutions are built. This paper aims to describe how the practice's concern with developing low energy buildings and evolving so called 'sustainable strategies' has and is informing it design approach and to illustrate the extent of the energy savings and reductions in pollutive emissions that are reasonably achievable. It is important to realise that, although 20 - 30% of these energy savings can be made by utilising recent advances in component technology, approximately 70 - 80% of possible affordable improvements are achievable by good orientation and clear concept design.
