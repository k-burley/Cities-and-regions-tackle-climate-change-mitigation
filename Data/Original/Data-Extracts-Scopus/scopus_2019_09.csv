The high electric field near SERS substrate and the large number of optical density of states, enable us to detect single molecule and their chemical specification. These high electric field locations are called hotspots which can be achieved in many ways: one interesting way to harness the electric fields of a nanocavity. Nanocavity assisted SERS(Surface-enhanced Raman Scattering) is studied in the context of the intensity enhancement, strong coupling, sensing capability etc. An important aspect of Cavity assisted SERS which has not been studied extensively is the wavevector distribution of the emission. Here we are studying the wavevector distribution of SERS emission from plasmonic nanowire-nanoparticle junction cavity using Fourier microscopy. The emission is confined to a narrow range of wavevectors perpendicular to the axis of the wire. This emission also excite multiple guided modes of the nanowire which has been imaged using leakage radiation Fourier microscopy. Further, we have characterized the polarization signature of the emission in the Fourier plane. The results are modeled with finite element method based numerical simulation. © OSA 2019.

It provide the possibility to determine optimal control parameters, according to selected objectives and operating constraints. This methodology is able to automatically identify the optimal engine calibration with less computational effort. Only in this way, the reliability of an integrated metamodel/optimizer approach can be included in a general-purpose that is to identify the engine calibration that minimizes motor vehicle emissions according to European emission standards (European Union in Off J Eur Union 50, 2007). As long as it improves mean effective pressure and reduces exergy destruction due to heat transfer and combustion process. Since, in internal combustion engines, more than 30–40 % of fuel energy wastes through the exhaust and just 12–25 % of the fuel energy converts to useful work. So, researchers are motivated to recover the heat from the waste sources in engines using the ways which not only reduce the demand of fossil fuels, but also reduce the harmful greenhouse gases and help to energy saving (Hatami et al. in Neural Comput Appl 25(7–8):2079–2090, 2014). The advantages of this contribution include the ability to study a wide range of parametric space and to independently evaluate physical and chemical processes, and detailed in-cylinder information, which is normally not available or is inaccessible in experiments. The uncertainty of the information in this unexplored design region can be quantified.

Understanding the driving forces of CO2 emissions is necessary to develop effective policies for low-carbon economic development. However, because of differences in the socioeconomic systems within the BTH region, it is important to investigate the differences in the driving factors of CO2 emissions between Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. In this paper, we calculated the energy-related industrial CO2 emissions (EICE) in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei from 2006 to 2016. We then applied an extended LMDI (logarithmic mean Divisia index) method to determine the driving forces of EICE during different time periods and in different subregions within the BTH region. The results show that EICE increased and then decreased from 2006 to 2016 in the BTH region. In all subregions, energy intensity, industrial structure, and research and development (R&amp;D) efficiency effect negatively affected EICE, whereas gross domestic product per capita effect and population had positive effects on EICE. However, R&amp;D intensity and investment intensity had opposite effects in some parts of the BTH region; the effect of R&amp;D intensity on EICE was positive in Beijing and Tianjin but negative in Hebei, while the effect of investment intensity was negative in Beijing but positive in Tianjin and Hebei. The findings of this study can contribute to the development of policies to reduce EICE in the BTH region. © 2019 by the authors.","BTH region; Industrial CO2 emissions; Investment and R&D; LMDI","carbon dioxide; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental economics; industrial development; industrial district; industrial emission; investment incentive; research and development; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072602056

We integrated biogeochemical and molecular ecological approaches to investigate microbial activity and diversity, with the goal of elucidating pathways and regulations of methane cycling and low molecular weight (LMW) compounds metabolism in different deep-sea sediments of the South China Sea. We found that methanogenesis, anaerobic oxidation of methane, and sulfate reduction occurred concurrently with low rates in surface sediments of the Haima area (~ 50 cm push cores) and in subsurface sediments of the Shenhu area (~ 8 m piston core). In the presence of sulfate, methanogenesis was fueled by methylotrophic substrates, in agreement with thermodynamic calculations as well as the detection of the methylotrophic methanogenic genus Methanococcoides. Higher oxidation rates of LMW compounds than methanogenesis rates, suggested acetate, and to a lesser extent, methanol and methylamine, were predominantly utilized as an energy source by nonmethanogenic microorganisms (e.g., sulfate-reducing bacteria). Diverse methanotrophic archaea (e.g., ANME-1a/b and ANME-2a/b) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g., Desulfarculaceae and Desulfobacteraceae) were observed and the abundance of mcrA and dsrA genes varied over depth and between sites. Dominant archaeal groups, such as Bathyarchaeota, Thermoplasmatale, Woesearchaeota, Lokiarchaeota, were consistently detected at both areas. Multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated sulfate was the most relevant environmental variable that correlated with the archaeal community composition. These results suggested that the presence of sulfate controlled methane cycling and LMW carbon metabolism pathways, and also affected the composition of the microbial community. © 2019 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",,"biogeochemistry; deep-sea sediment; metabolism; methane; methanogenesis; methanogenic bacterium; microbial activity; microbial community; sediment chemistry; species diversity; sulfate-reducing bacterium; surficial sediment; Pacific Ocean; Shenhu; South China Sea; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Desulfobacteraceae; Methanococcoides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072070805

Results of production reduction, excess emission amounts, benefits of different industries, penalties and system benefits under various credibility satisfaction levels (α levels and γ levels), wind velocities and optimism levels (λ levels) are generated. Results reveal that (a) whole industrial production would reduce for satisfying the environmental regulation under various credibility satisfaction levels. For example, production reduction amounts of cement manufacturing industry (CMI) would be [175, 185] × 103 ton/year, when γ varied from 0.6 to 0.9 (h = 1, t = 1). (b) Industrial reduction and excess pollution amounts would reduce with increasing of wind velocities. (c) On the process of optimizing the industrial scale and structure, fuzzy uncertainties from human judgments (e.g., air quality standards) have great influence on the satisfaction and violation risk of the system.

The enhancement is formed together by porous surface and lower band gap of ST2, which could offer more active sites and facilitate faster electron-hole pair separation.

First, we conclude that high spatial agglomeration, CO2 emissions centralized along the river and coastline, and a structure with three circular layers are the three notable temporal-spatial characteristics of Shanghai fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Second, we find that large point sources are the leading factors that shaped the temporal-spatial characteristics of Shanghai CO2 emission distributions. The changes of CO2 emissions in each grid during 2010-2015 indicate that the energy-controlling policies of large point emission sources have had positive effects on CO2 reduction since 2012. The changes suggest that targeted policies can have a disproportionate impact on urban emissions. Third, area sources bring more uncertainties to the forecasting of carbon emissions. We use the Geographical Detector method to identify these leading factors that influence CO2 emissions emitted from area sources. We find that Shanghai's circular layer structure, population density, and population activity intensity are the leading factors. This result implied that urban planning has a large impact on the distribution of urban CO2 emissions. At last, we find that unbalanced development within the city will lead to different leading impact factors for each circular layer. Factors such as urban development intensity, traffic land, and industrial land have stronger power to determine CO2 emissions in the areas outside the Outer Ring, while factors such as population density and population activity intensity have stronger impacts in the other two inner areas. This research demonstrates the potential utility of high-resolution carbon emission data to advance the integration of urban planning for the reduction of urban CO2 emissions and provide information for policymakers to make targeted policies across different areas within the city. © 2019 by the authors.","High-resolution grid; Impact mechanism; Shanghai; Temporal and spatial process; Urban CO2 emissions; Urban planning","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data set; fossil fuel; policy making; pollutant source; population density; spatiotemporal analysis; urban development; urban planning; urban pollution; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071989534

We report here that the PPS constructed by integrating a black titania (B-TiO2) photocatalyst with a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) can effectively remove toluene with above 70% CO2 selectivity and remarkably reduced the concentration of secondary pollutants of ozone and nitrogen oxides at a specific energy input of 1500 J • l-1, while exhibiting good stability. Photocatalyst characterizations suggest that the B-TiO2 provides a high concentration of oxygen vacancies for the surface oxidation of toluene in DBD, and efficiently absorbs ultraviolet-visible light emitted from the discharge to induce plasma photocatalytic oxidation of toluene. The presence of B-TiO2 in the plasma region also results in a high discharge efficiency, facilitating the generation of large numbers of reactive species and thus the oxidation of toluene towards CO2.

In this study, we focused on a continuous heavy air pollution event that affected Hubei from 12 to 24 January 2018, and examined the meteorological conditions, regional transport features, boundary-layer characteristics, and the evolution of PM and gaseous pollutants in Xiangyang (XY), Jingmen (JM), Jingzhou (JZ), Yichang (YC), Xiaogan (XG), and Wuhan (WH). The results showed that this pollution event was the result of joint action of fog, haze, and fog-haze transformation weather. The pure haze was mainly concentrated at the pollution-transport channel (XY and JM) of Hubei. The explosive growth of PM concentrations was more obvious in XY, JM, and JZ than that in YC, XG, and WH, with the growth and reduction rates of PM2.5 at XY station, at 20.11 and 19.50 μg/(m3·h), respectively. During the explosive growth period, northerly winds were dominant at XY, JM, JZ, XG, and WH stations, with large and weak wind speed (WS) resulted in significantly increased PM2.5 concentrations in XY and JM (transport), and in JM, JZ, and YC (accumulation), respectively. The height of northward airflow reached 2000 m in the main pollutant transport channel of Hubei. The upper and lower inversion layers would be enhanced before the explosive growth of PM concentration significantly, then be weakened by continuous transport of the northerly airflow. The concentrations of SO2, NO2, and CO decreased with the increase in WS during the explosive growth period, and O3 concentration reached maximum value at a WS of 3.5–5 m/s. The correlation analysis indicated significant differences in the effects of transport and accumulation. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Boundary layer; Inversion layer; Pollution event; Transportation; Wind",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070753767

The enhanced boiling surfaces with great durability are highly desired for energy-intensive industrial applications. Here an optimized graphene oxide (GO)self-assembly surface for significantly enhanced boiling is developed, which could be readily fabricated utilizing the nucleate boiling self-assembly method. The optimal GO boiling surface produces remarkable improvements in boiling heat transfer performance (a CHF of 261 W cm-2 and a HTC of 9.1 W cm-2 K−1), which is among the highest values ever reported for pool boiling heat transfer on the planar enhanced surfaces. Additionally, it shows a good durability. The prominent performance can be attributed to the formation of interconnected and highly thermally conductive GO laminate film with moderate thickness on the substrate, which facilitates rapid cooling and rewetting of the local hot/dry regions, as well as bubble nucleation, thereby delay the occurrence of film boiling regime. The proposed strategy in current work is highly scalable and possesses enormous potentials in pragmatic applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Boiling heat transfer; Critical heat flux; Durability; Graphene oxide; Surface characteristics","Durability; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy transfer; Gas emissions; Graphene; Graphene oxide; Greenhouse gases; Heat flux; Self assembly; Boiling heat transfer; Boiling heat transfer performance; Critical heat flux(CHF); Enhanced boiling surfaces; Global energy savings; Heat transfer coefficient (HTC); Pool boiling heat transfer; Surface characteristics; Heat transfer performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065826369

Soil drought and atmospheric aridity are 2 main physiological stressors driving widespread vegetation mortality and reduced terrestrial carbon uptake. Here, we empirically demonstrate that strong negative coupling between soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit occurs globally, indicating high probability of cooccurring soil drought and atmospheric aridity. Using the Global Land Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (GLACE)-CMIP5 experiment, we further show that concurrent soil drought and atmospheric aridity are greatly exacerbated by land–atmosphere feedbacks. The feedback of soil drought on the atmosphere is largely responsible for enabling atmospheric aridity extremes. In addition, the soil moisture–precipitation feedback acts to amplify precipitation and soil moisture deficits in most regions. CMIP5 models further show that the frequency of concurrent soil drought and atmospheric aridity enhanced by land–atmosphere feedbacks is projected to increase in the 21st century. Importantly, land–atmosphere feedbacks will greatly increase the intensity of both soil drought and atmospheric aridity beyond that expected from changes in mean climate alone. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Among the main sources of PM2.5 in Beijing, the contributions from vehicle sources increased from 5.6% (2000) to 31.1% (2012) to 45% (2017). In 2010, the CO, hydrocarbon (HC), NOx, and particulate matter (PM) emissions of yellow-label vehicles (YLVs) accounted for 46.1%, 47.9%, 63.1% and 86.1% of the total emissions from on-road vehicles. In recent years, China has been implementing a YLV scrappage subsidy policy to control air pollution, and this policy has cost several hundred billion yuan nationwide. However, China has not evaluated the costs and benefits of the policy. Many people question whether the YLV scrappage subsidy policy is worthwhile, but all the stakeholders involved complicate the process of accurately evaluating the true value of the policy. In this study, we evaluated and compared the costs and benefits of the policy in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region based on 1.362 million YLVs from 2008 to 2015. Because of the implementation of the policy, the PM2.5, PM10, NOx, CO and HC emissions in the BTH region decreased by 16.46, 18.12, 174.44, 669.11, and 91.64 kt, respectively, in 2008–2015. The results show that the policy played an important role in reducing pollutant emissions and improving environmental quality in the BTH region. The costs, benefits, and net benefits of the policy were 13.69, 34.03, and 20.34 billion yuan, respectively. The cost-benefit ratio in the BTH region was 1:2.49; at the city scale, Beijing ranked first (1:7.27), and the cost-benefit ratios of Tianjin and Hebei Province were 1:2.06 and 1:1.14, respectively. Of the 13 cities in the BTH region, Beijing had the highest net benefits, amounting to 16.43 billion yuan, while Handan City has the lowest net benefits, amounting to −0.58 billion yuan. The results may provide scientific support for the promotion of older vehicle and diesel vehicle scrappage subsidy policies, the development of cost-benefit analysis (CBA), and effective environmental decision-making in China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accelerated vehicle retirement; Beijing-tianjin-hebei region; China; Cost-benefit analysis; Vehicle scrappage subsidy policy; Yellow-label vehicle","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Behavioral research; Costs; Decision making; Environmental protection; Nitrogen oxides; Vehicles; Accelerated vehicle retirement; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; China; Cost benefit ratio; Environmental decision making; Environmental quality; Particulate matter emissions; Vehicle scrappage; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067003092

We applied a directional distance function to estimate the carbon emission performance of 30 provinces in China during the period 2000–2016. We selected an index system to assess urbanization processes in these provinces and conducted a spatial analysis to investigate the relationship between urbanization and carbon emission performance. We obtained the following results. First, the carbon emission performance of the eastern region, valued at 0.853, was relatively higher than the corresponding values of 0.810, 0.804, and 0.843 in the central, western, and northeastern regions, respectively. However, during this period, disparities among provinces increased. Second, the average urbanization value for each province showed an upward trend during the study period, and urbanization assumed a “striped” spatial agglomeration pattern. A third finding was that carbon emission performance and urbanization demonstrated a relationship of positive spatial dependence. The average value of their coordinated coupling indicated an upward trend, with an annual increase of 0.85%. Last, we found that efforts to reduce carbon emissions that are solely based on carbon emission performance do not yield reliable results. Accordingly, measurements of urbanization values can enable more detailed differentiation. In conclusion, reasonable measures should be implemented to improve carbon emission performance and urbanization that are in alignment with the actual situation within a given region. © 2019 Zhou et al.

Herein, we prepared non-rare-earth self-activated and rare-earth activated LiCa3MgV3O12 (LCMV) phosphors by a conventional high-temperature solid-state reaction method. Their structure, luminescence as well as temperature sensing property have been systematically investigated. In this sample, the emissions of Eu3+ ions and [VO4]3− group have been simultaneously monitored under 335 nm UV light excitation. The FIR of Eu3+ to [VO4]3- shows great temperature sensing property in temperature range from 303 K–523 K,owing to the energy transfer and thermal quenching behavior. The measured maximum absolute and relative temperature sensitivity of this phosphor are 0.011 K−1 and 1.689%K−1, which is remarkably higher than most of luminescent materials reported previously. Meanwhile, the emission peaks of [VO4]3- (475 nm) and Eu3+ (610 nm) provide a good signal discriminability for temperature detection.

This process requires a dramatic increase in resource inputs, including fertilizer-nitrogen (N) and organic residues (e.g., stover), which alter the soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrous oxide (N2O). The dearth of N2O emission data for SSA croplands, however, limits our ability to define regional and global N2O flux and mitigation opportunities. In two soils planted with maize in Tanzania (Iringa, sandy Alfisols; Mbeya, clayey Andisols), we conducted year-round measurements for 2 consecutive years to quantify N2O emissions in response to increasing N rates and in combination with maize stover incorporation. Rainfall and the resulting soil moisture, rather than soil temperature, were important environmental drivers of N2O emissions in these fields. Applied N stimulated N2O fluxes across soil types but with different magnitudes—lower in Iringa because of the dominance of nitrification in N2O production and higher in Mbeya likely from promoted denitrification when the water-filled pore space was &gt;47%. N2O emission increased exponentially or linearly with N rate, depending on the year. The direct N2O emission factors were well below the 1% of the IPCC Tier 1 method, ranging from 0.13% to 0.26% in Iringa and from 0.24% to 0.42% in Mbeya, for a N rate of 50–150 kg N ha−1 during the study. Compared with N application alone, stover plus N did not significantly alter maize yield, but did raise N2O emissions significantly (P ≤ 0.06). Consequently, stover incorporation markedly increased the emission factor (up to 0.46% in Iringa and 1.29% in Mbeya) as well as yield-scaled N2O emissions. Our results suggest that linear and exponential emission responses can occur in SSA croplands and challenge the promotion of combining stover with fertilizer-N as resource input management in this region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","N rate; Soil type; Stover incorporation; Sub-Saharan African croplands; Water-filled pore space","agricultural land; air-soil interaction; crop yield; denitrification; maize; nitrification; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; soil type; Iringa [Tanzania]; Mbeya [Tanzania]; Sub-Saharan Africa; Tanzania; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065711499

Experimentally, constant composition expansion (CCE) tests of three alkane solvent(s)–CO2–heavy oil systems are conducted with a visualized PVT cell under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. The liquid height and pressure of the system are continuously monitored and recorded during experiments to measure, respectively, the bubblepoint pressure, pseudo-bubblepoint pressure, and the entrained gas volume. With the assumption of instantaneous nucleation, a mathematical model which integrates Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS), Fick's second law, and nonequilibrium boundary condition has been developed to quantify not only the amount of the evolved gas and entrained gas, but also the dynamic composition of gas phase as a function of time. Once the deviations between the measured gas volumes and the calculated ones have been minimized, the mass transfer Biot number, individual diffusion coefficient, and interface mass transfer coefficient of each gas component as well as the gas bubble number are determined. Increases in experimental temperature and pressure are found to impose opposite effects on diffusion coefficient during gas exsolution processes. The diffusion of each gas component is found to be faster when the temperature becomes higher or the initial pressure becomes lower. Either CO2 or C3H8 diffuses faster than CH4 in the liquid phase under the same condition. In addition, the interface mass transfer coefficients, with an order of CO2 &gt; CH4 &gt; C3H8, obtained in this study are much higher than those collected in the literature since the nonequilibrium conditions greatly facilitate gas exsolution. The determined mass transfer Biot numbers in this study are large, indicating that the bulk resistance due to molecular diffusion inside the heavy oil dominates the gas exsolution process compared to the interfacial resistance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alkane solvents-CO2-heavy oil systems; Equation of state; Gas exsolution; Individual diffusion coefficient; Interfacial resistance; Nonequilibrium conditions","Carbon dioxide; Crude oil; Diffusion; Equations of state of gases; Functions; Gases; Heavy oil production; Organic solvents; Paraffins; Equation of state; Exsolution; Interfacial resistances; Nonequilibrium conditions; Oil system; Phase interfaces; alkane; carbon dioxide; diffusion; equation of state; exsolution; heavy oil; solvent",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068104763

Foreign direct investment (FDI) plays a decisive role in seeking out market technology brands and enhancing the global competitiveness among international inflows. With the requirement of economic development, this paper focused on a performance evaluation of FDI in China. However, because of the planned transformation to a market economy in China, FDI has been promoted with a regional cascade structure. Similar to the development track of the Chinese economy, it is necessary to evaluate FDI quality more than purely quantity from a provincial point of view. Therefore, this paper evaluated the Chinese provincial FDI total factor productivity using the dynamic Malmquist model. In contrast to traditional evaluations, this paper focused on inter-temporal influence in FDI performance evaluation. To understand the inter-temporal effects, physical capital stock was defined as a dynamic variable in FDI sustainability performance. Additionally, with the pressure to reduce emissions, energy consumption was also considered during the evaluation. The empirical results revealed that the dynamic variable is the bottleneck in FDI performance for most Chinese provinces. It is only efficient in a few municipalities and provinces, such as Shanghai and Guangdong. Additionally, energy conservation was more efficient in the performance evaluation of eastern regions in China. © 2019 by the authors.

PM2.5 is one of the core pollutants which cause haze pollution in China. Existing studies have rarely taken a comprehensive view of natural environmental conditions and socio-economic factors to figure out the cause and diffusion mechanism of PM2.5 pollution. This paper selected both natural environmental conditions (precipitation (PRE), wind speed (WIN), and terrain relief (TR)) and socio-economic factors (human activity intensity of land surface (HAILS), the secondary industry's proportion (SEC), and the total particulate matter emissions of motor vehicles (VE)) to analyze the effects on the spatial variation of PM2.5 concentrations. Based on the spatial panel data of 289 cities in China in 2015, we used spatial statistical methods to visually describe the spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 pollution; secondly, the spatial agglomeration state of PM2.5 pollution was characterized by Moran's I; finally, several regression models were used to quantitatively analyze the correlation between PM2.5 pollution and the selected explanatory variables. Results from this paper confirm that in 2015, most cities in China suffered from severe PM2.5 pollution, and only 17.6% of the sample cities were up to standard. The spatial agglomeration characteristics of PM2.5 pollution in China were particularly significant in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Results from the global regression models suggest that WIN exerts the most significant effects on decreasing PM2.5 concentration (p &lt; 0.01), while VE is the most critical driver of increasing PM2.5 concentration (p &lt; 0.01). Results from the local regression model show reliable evidence that the relation between PM2.5 concentrations and the explanatory variables varied differently over space. VE is the most critical factor that influences PM2.5 concentrations, which means controlling motor vehicle pollutant emissions is an effective measure to reduce PM2.5 pollution in Chinese cities. © 2019 by the authors.","China; Natural environmental conditions; PM2.5 concentration; Socio-economic factors; Spatial variation","atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental conditions; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; exploration; haze; panel data; particulate matter; socioeconomic impact; spatial variation; traffic emission; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071988845

Therefore, year-round measurements of aerosol optical properties from August 2016 to July 2017 at an urban site in Beijing were analysed. The results show that the annual mean scattering coefficient (σsp at 550 nm, 131 ± 135 Mm−1)was approximately half of the measurement in Beijing from 2008 to 2009 and from 2005 to 2006, mainly due to the reduction of PM2.5 and scattering aerosols in recent years. Meanwhile, annual mean of σabs (637 nm)and SSA was 14 ± 11 Mm−1 and 0.85 ± 0.06, respectively. Seasonally, σsp during winter was approximately two times higher than in other seasons, while σabs was higher during autumn and winter, which may be attributed to biomass and fossil fuel burning under a shallow and stable boundary layer. Diurnal variation of σsp showed an evening peak and a slight morning peak in spring and summer, as well as a night peak in autumn and winter. σabs in four seasons were basically unimodal, with a morning peak in spring and summer, and a night peak in autumn and winter. In addition, the scattering Ångström exponent and backscattering Ångström exponent suggested the dominance of micro-size aerosols. Seasonal variations of SAE, BAE and the backscatter fraction indicated a larger proportion of isotropic scattering and fine-mode particles in summer and autumn, as well as a dominance of coarse particles in spring and a complicated aerosol type distribution and emission sources in winter. Furthermore, radiative forcing was estimated by a radiative transfer model. Radiative forcing varied between −6.69 and −235.67 Wm-2 (with the average of −54.93 ± 39.92 Wm-2)at the surface, with a mean of 35.56 ± 22.88 Wm-2 in the atmosphere. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption coefficient; Ngström exponent; Radiative forcing; Scattering coefficient; Single scattering albedo; Å","Atmospheric radiation; Backscattering; Boundary layers; Budget control; Fossil fuels; Optical properties; Radiative transfer; Uncertainty analysis; Urban growth; Absorption co-efficient; Aerosol optical characteristic; Aerosol radiative forcing; Atmospheric aerosol particles; Radiative forcings; Radiative transfer model; Scattering co-efficient; Single scattering albedo; Atmospheric aerosols; fossil fuel; absorption coefficient; aerosol composition; albedo; boundary layer; combustion; diurnal variation; fossil fuel; optical depth; particle size; radiative forcing; aerosol; Article; autumn; biomass; China; circadian rhythm; humidity; meteorology; optics; priority journal; radiative forcing; seasonal variation; spring; summer; surface property; urban area; wind speed; winter; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065892311

The in-depth knowledge of the complex relationships between climate and population sizes through density dependent demographic processes is important for understanding and predicting population shifts under climate change, which requires integrated population models (IPMs) that unify the analyses of demography and abundance data. In this study we developed an IPM based on Gaussian approximation to dynamic N-mixture models for large scale population data. We then analyzed four decades (1972–2013) of mallard Anas platyrhynchos breeding population survey, band-recovery and climate data covering a large spatial extent from North American prairies through boreal habitat to Alaska. We aimed to test the hypothesis that climate change will cause shifts in population dynamics if climatic effects on demographic parameters that have substantial contribution to population growth vary spatially. More specifically, we examined the spatial variation of climatic effects on density dependent population demography, identified the key demographic parameters that are influential to population growth, and forecasted population responses to climate change. Our results revealed that recruitment, which explained more variance of population growth than survival, was sensitive to the temporal variation of precipitation in the southern portion of the study area but not in the north. Survival, by contrast, was insensitive to climatic variation. We then forecasted a decrease in mallard breeding population density in the south and an increase in the northwestern portion of the study area, indicating potential shifts in population dynamics under future climate change. Our results implied that different strategies need to be considered across regions to conserve waterfowl populations in the face of climate change. Our modelling approach can be adapted for other species and thus has wide application to understanding and predicting population dynamics in the presence of global change. © 2019 The Authors","Anas platyrhynchos; Dail–Madsen model; demography; ecological forecast; global change; integrative modeling; mortality; reproduction; system shift","abundance; breeding population; climate change; demography; density dependence; Gaussian method; global climate; integrated approach; mortality; population growth; population modeling; population size; prediction; reproduction; survival; wader; Anas platyrhynchos; Anatidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066075332

To realize the assumption, the 1,4-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane was used as bridging agent to synthesize bis-functional dicationic ionic liquid with symmetric structure, followed by co-carbonization with carbon precursor to prepare target products under mild conditions. Three anions included bis(salicylato)borate (BScB), hexafluorophosphate (PF6) and bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (NTf2) are utilized to tune their physicochemical properties. The chemical and microstructural properties of the products were characterized by NMR, FTIR, Raman mapping spectra, XPS, UV–visible spectra, Fluorescence spectra, SEM, HRTEM and so on. The produced CDs-IL with an average diameter range of 1–3 nm exhibit excitation-dependent maximum fluorescence at 340/405 nm, 440/518 nm and 380/458 nm for CDs-BScB, CDs-PF6 and CDs-NTf2, respectively. The CDs-PF6 is found to exhibit excellent anti-wear and friction-reducing properties as nanoadditives for PEG base fluid, which achieves remarkably improved anti-wear properties (96.5%) and friction-reducing (72.7%) properties simultaneously, owing to the formation of a protective carbon-based layer at the contact regions.

The adsorption competition mechanism of gas molecules (H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, and H2) on CaO-based catalyst surfaces was studied using density functional theory (DFT) and experimental methods. The adsorption characteristics of CO2 on CaO and 10 wt % Ni/CaO (100) surfaces were investigated in a temperature range of 550–700◦C. The adsorption energies were increased and then weakened, reaching their maximum at 650◦C. The simulation results were verified by CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) experiments. By the density of states and Mulliken population analysis, CaO doped with Ni caused a change in the electronic structure of the Osurf atom and decreased the C–O bond stability. The molecular competition mechanism on the CaO-based catalyst surface was identified by DFT simulation. As a result, the adsorption energies decreased in the following order: H2O &gt; CO2 &gt; CO &gt; CH4 &gt; H2. The increase of CO2 adsorption energy on the 10 wt % Ni/CaO surface, compared with the CaO surface, was the largest among those of the studied molecules, and its value increased from 1.45 eV to 1.81 eV. Therefore, the 10 wt % Ni/CaO catalyst is conducive to in situ CO2 capture in biomass pyrolysis. © 2019 by the authors.

This study collected the meteorological data of Beijing from November 1, 2013 to October 31, 2017, employed vector autoregression (VAR)model, Granger causality test, impulse response function and variance decomposition to explore the dynamic effects of average humidity, extreme wind speed, sunshine duration, average wind speed and rainfall capacity on air quality index (AQI). The results indicated that the air pollution in Beijing was mainly a self-aggregation and self-diffusion process, the self-cumulative effect accounted for around 88.9318% during 5 periods, once the diffusion conditions of air pollution worsen, air pollution would be formed within 3 days. Meteorological conditions, especially extreme wind speed, sunshine duration and average humidity affected the concentration and spatial-temporal distribution of air pollutant. Extreme wind speed as atmospheric dynamic factor rather than average wind speed was the most important meteorological element influencing the AQI change in Beijing, which caused more atmospheric motion and turbulence, improving the diffusion and dilution ability of air pollutant, whose self-cumulative influence was around 7.5270% during 5 periods. Sunshine duration as atmospheric thermal factor was the secondary important meteorological element affecting AQI change in Beijing for it was associated with the formation of temperature stratification and inversion, the self-cumulative effect accounted for around 2.1402% during 4 periods. This study deepens the insights about the formation and diffusion mechanism of air pollution in Beijing, introduces nontraditional methods to review traditional issue and draw valuable conclusions.

To prevent urban sprawl, the compact city design intensively focuses on the improvement of housing and transport services to increase urban accessibility, vitality and diversity. Clean water and sanitation is also an essential function of cities, but the impacts from China's future urbanization on unheeded water infrastructure were sparsely estimated, especially from a perspective of urban metabolism. This study examines the complex response in the water sector to Chinese urban policies taking resource efficiency into account GHG emissions. A hypothetical grid-city model was developed to connect technical parameters in urban water infrastructure systems to the socio-economic changes, such as population growth, housing blocks, and water end-use. The results show that the pipeline construction dominates material use and locks in significant GHG emissions in the water sector. The most efficient urbanization scenario can reduce 60% of GHG emissions from the water infrastructure, compared to the case of urban sprawl with residency restriction in large cities. A trade-off in scenarios was observed between the optimization for mega-cities and the optimization for the whole of China regarding the additional energy consumption for pumping in the water sector. As empirical evidence of China, this study shows the conflict between SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and SDG 13 (Climate action) in the urban water sector can be largely alleviated by an efficiency-focused urban policy complying with SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities). A loosen migration regulation and compact urban planning in the medium- and large-sized cities are recommended, along with advanced water technologies to promote sustainable urban water management in China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","GHG emissions; Material flow analysis (MFA); SDG 6; Sustainable urban water management; Urban policy; Urban water systems","Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Land use; Population statistics; Sanitation; Urban transportation; Water management; Water supply; GHG emission; Material flow analysis; SDG 6; Urban policy; Urban water management; Urban water systems; Urban growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067292541

An increasing number of studies are investigating the potential responses of plants to future global climate change scenarios, and although warming and drought may greatly influence ecosystem function and services, their combined effects on C:N:P:K stoichiometry remain unknown. In the present study, we assessed the stoichiometry of a major subtropical tree species Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook, in southern China in terms of its responses to warming and drought stresses. To measure C, N, P, and K concentrations, C:N:P:K stoichiometric ratios, and stable isotope abundance, we sampled C. lanceolata needles from seedlings subject to four treatments: control (CT), warming (W, with 5 °C increase in temperature), drought (D, with 50% decrease in precipitation), and the abovementioned warming and drought conditions combined (WD). The warming and drought conditions applied simulated the climate changes predicted for the next decades in southern China. We found that variations in foliar C:N:P:K stoichiometric ratios were driven by changes in nutrient concentration, season, and treatment. Unexpectedly, differences in foliar intrinsic water use efficiency across sampling seasons were not significant. The WD conditions increased foliar N concentration (57%) and the δ15N value (111%) across the different seasons, and significant interactive effects between warming and drought on foliar N concentration and δ15N were clearly demonstrated. The N cycle is likely to accelerate in subtropical forests, with more of the “heavier” N being mobilized for plant use, and thus the combination of warming plus drought may alleviate plant N restrictions in the future. Thus, foliar δ15N might be used as an indicator of the changes in N cycling in C. lanceolata forests. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Combined effect; Drought; Stable isotope; Stoichiometry; Warming","Drought; Ecology; Forestry; Isotopes; Stoichiometry; Tropics; Combined effect; Cunninghamia lanceolata; Ecological stoichiometry; Global climate changes; Intrinsic water-use efficiencies; Nutrient concentrations; Stable isotopes; Warming; Climate change; climate change; concentration (composition); drought; ecosystem function; global climate; global warming; organic matter; precipitation (climatology); stable isotope; stoichiometry; subtropical region; tree; water use efficiency; Drought; Ecology; Forestry; Isotopes; Stoichiometry; Tropics; China; Cunninghamia lanceolata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067335353

We conducted a survey of 404 herdsmen households in a typical steppe region of Inner Mongolia, the province with the highest number of livestock in China. This study identifies different livestock management modes, and analyzes their carbon footprint and carbon efficiencies. The results show that: (1) according to source of household income, there are seven management modes, including small livestock breeding-oriented, large livestock breeding-oriented, mixed small/large livestock breeding, grassland byproduct-oriented, pasture leasing-oriented, non-livestock-oriented, and mixed with breeding and non-livestock. The dominant management mode in this typical steppe region of Inner Mongolia was small livestock breeding-oriented. (2) Among the seven management modes, mixed with breeding, and non-livestock management, had the highest household carbon footprint (7.22 t CO2), and also the highest household income (208,500 Chinese Yuan), while grassland byproduct-oriented management had the lowest household carbon footprint (5.07 t CO2), and pasture leasing-oriented management had the lowest household income (71,000 Chinese Yuan). (3) Based on the Gini coefficient, the distribution of household carbon footprint among the seven management modes was relatively equal (0.26), but the direct carbon footprint showed the greatest inequality among these management modes (0.38). (4) The seven management modes showed significant differences in carbon efficiency, with grassland byproduct-oriented management, and mixed small/large livestock breeding management, ranked in the top two, while pasture leasing-oriented management had the lowest carbon efficiency. We identified grassland byproduct-oriented management, and mixed small/large livestock breeding management, as the two most optimal management modes. Although the pasture leasing-oriented management mode exhibited a lower household carbon footprint, it also had the lowest carbon efficiency, and so its adoption should be cautious. © 2019","Carbon efficiency; Carbon footprint; Income; Livestock","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Efficiency; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Carbon efficiency; Gini coefficients; Household income; Income; Livestock; Livestock breeding; Livestock systems; Optimal management; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066442454

However, a spatially detailed dataset of various heat-releasing industrial sectors and large-scale characterization of heat emissions from industrial sources have not been reported yet. In this study, a dataset of heat-releasing industries was established using a national detection map of thermal anomalies produced by a novel and more accurate method employing daily nighttime visible infrared imaging radiometer suite thermal infrared images corresponding to 1 year. Subsequently, we quantified the dimensional features of heat radiation fluxes of China's industrial plants. A total of 12 114 industrial objects were structured in a two-level hierarchical dataset of heat-releasing industries, representing a magnitude of at least 1 order higher than the number enumerated in the state-of-the-art inventory of industrial heat sources across China. The satellite observations helped more completely characterize industrial heat plumes, which represent the industrial heat radiation fluxes with higher levels of densities that prevail in the central-eastern part of China having spatial clustering islands. Our results could be used to inform policy and environmental management in relation to meaningful dynamic industrial supervision, targeting extreme polluters and differentiated emission mitigation measurements.

The role of urban vegetation in the carbon cycle of urban developments in these types of cities is now being studied. We focus on identifying which urban plant community types have a greater influence on CO2 flux in cities, thus providing a scientific basis for low-carbon urban greening. Based on the eddy covariance (EC) observation system, ART Footprint Tool, plant inventory, and ecological community classification, we show that the CO2 flux characteristics of different plant communities vary temporally. The carbon sink duration during summer was the longest (up to 10 h) and the carbon sink duration was the shortest during winter (7.5 h). In addition, we discovered that the CO2 flux contribution rates of different plant community types are distinct. The annual average CO2 contribution rates of the Cinnamomum camphora-Trachycarpus fortunei community and the Metasequoia glyptostroboides+Sabina chinensis community are 11.88% and 0.93%, respectively. The CO2 flux contribution rate of the same plant community differs according to season. The CO2 contribution rate of the Cinnamomum camphora-Trachycarpus fortunei community exhibits local maxima during winter and summer, with a maximum difference of 11.16%. In contrast, the Metasequoia glyptostroboides+Sabina chinensis community has a CO2 contribution rate of 0.35% during the same period. In general, summer is the season with the lowest CO2 flux contribution rate of plant communities, and winter is the season with the highest CO2 flux contribution rate. However, the Cinnamomum camphora+Salix babylonica community and the Cinnamomum camphora+Sabina chinensis community present the opposite pattern. Finally, the diurnal variation characteristics of CO2 flux in different communities have the same trend, but the peak values differ significantly. Overall, daily CO2 flux peak value of the Metasequoia glyptostroboides community and the Cinnamomum camphora-Trachycarpus fortunei community indicate that these two plant communities exhibit a strong capacity for CO2 absorption in the study area. According to these research results, urban greening efforts in subtropical climates can increase the green space covered by the Cinnamomum camphora-Trachycarpus fortunei and the Metasequoia glyptostroboides community types when urban greening, so as to appropriately reduce the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2 flux; Eddy covariance; Flux footprint; Subtropical urban ecosystem; Vegetation community","air-soil interaction; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; eddy covariance; plant community; seasonal variation; subtropical region; urban development; urban ecosystem; China; Shanghai; Cinnamomum camphora; Metasequoia glyptostroboides; Salix babylonica; Trachycarpus fortunei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072639846

Herein, we introduced a high-voltage anodic electro-deposition process (AED) which is a novel avenue enabling the synthesis of hierarchical MnO2 on activated carbon cloth (H-MnO2/ACC). Interestingly, the concomitant activation of carbon cloth substrate is found to be beneficial to improve the conductivity and hydrophilic nature of our novel electrode. A FASC based on H-MnO2/ACC-300 and reduced carbon cloth (RCC) was assembled using a mixed ionic liquid gel (ionogel) electrolyte. Benefiting from highly conductive paths derived from intimately attached fiber-MnO2 interfaces, hierarchically interpenetrated lamella MnO2 porosity and concentric MnO2 interlayer voids, as well as the merits of ionic liquid, the resultant FASC delivers an output voltage as high as 4 V and an impressive volumetric energy density of 3.82 mWh/cm3. Furthermore, the optimized H-MnO2/ACC-300 electrode with high mass loading can even retain 94.2% of initial capacitance upon 5000 cycles in 1 M Na2SO4. The unique H-MnO2/ACC can aid in the rational design towards flexible electronic devices with high mass loading and this synthetic strategy opens up enormous possibilities for the fabrication of electrodeposited materials. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Activated carbon cloth; Binder-free electrode; Flexible solid-state supercapacitor; Hierarchical MnO2; Mixed ionic liquid","Activated carbon; Capacitance; Chemical activation; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolytes; Ionic liquids; Manganese oxide; Phase interfaces; Sodium sulfate; Supercapacitor; Activated carbon cloth; Asymmetric supercapacitor; Binder free; Electrochemical activation; Flexible electronic devices; Flexible solids; Hierarchical MnO2; Volumetric energy densities; Loading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065075910

Considering the significant interest in the Diels–Alder (D–A) reactions of substituted cyclopropenes, here we studied the bonding and D–A reactions of 24 substituted 2BB molecules at the B3LYP-D3/6-311G** theoretical level. Computations showed that the inverted C=C bond lengths fall in the range of 1.46–1.50 Å and 2BB is of significant characteristic of a singlet biradical with two σ single electrons and π aromatic conjugation over the three-membered rings. Yet ab initio valence bond computations showed that the inverted bonds are charge-shifted, and the ionic resonance structures arising from charge-shifting are of carbene characteristics as well. Thus, substituted 2BB’s can also be considered as B-heterocyclic carbenes. Since the LUMOs of the 2BB derivatives are similar to those of ethene and cyclopropene, we studied their D–A reactions with butadiene. All cycloaddition reactions kinetically and thermodynamically favor the formation of the derivatives of 7-bora-oct-3-ene[4.1.1]propellane undergoing endo transition states. Notably, there is a good correlation between the reaction barriers and the hyperconjugative aromatic and antiaromatic stabilization enthalpies for all substituted 2BB’s. In other words, the differences in their reactivity result from the difference in their aromatic stability. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2-Borabicyclo(1.1.0)but-1(3)-ene; B-heterocyclic carbene; Charge-shifted bond; Diels–Alder reaction; Valence bond (VB)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071014291

Data were drawn from a representative sample of 1680 Australians. The results revealed that spatial distance framing influences air passengers’ perceived credibility of aviation VCO messages. Messages focusing on the influence of VCO programs on the environment of a local community obtain higher perceived credibility than those located in other countries. The study also found the interaction of spatial and temporal distance framing effects were different based on consumers’ past purchase experience.

Statistical downscaling uses low-resolution outputs from climate models and historical observations to both enhance the spatial resolution and correct for systematic biases. By examining the downscaled rainfall over land, we show that although bias corrections are effective in reducing biases in the current climate, they do not reduce the intermodel spread in future rainfall projections. This failure stems from the strong dependence of future rainfall change upon the current climatological rainfall patterns. Even after bias corrections are applied, the downscaled projections of precipitation change retain this dependence upon their native climatology. However, we show that this dependence can be exploited; even very simple methods to subset models according to their ability to resolve the observed rainfall climatology can substantially reduce the intermodel spread in rainfall projections. ©2019.

The modal complementarity and air-HSR intermodal services, together with the network feature of airline business, are also examined. The paper then reviews theoretical and empirical findings on the impacts of HSR on airports and regional economies. Here, the main insights include: First, HSR can have a traffic redistribution effect on airport traffic; in particular, some primary hub airports with good air connectivity may gain traffic while others may lose traffic. Second, to mitigate congestion at hub airports, policy makers may consider diverting some traffic to regional airports by promoting air-HSR intermodal services. Third, as HSR may stimulate long-haul/international air traffic, its overall impact on emission reduction remains unclear. Finally, similar to the impacts on airport traffic, spatial disparity of economic activities may also rise after the introduction of HSR. In general, the disparity tends to rise between the cities with HSR and those without HSR, as the former gets better accessibility. However, among the cities with HSR services, the disparity between the large and small cities could increase or decrease depending on several factors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Airline; Airport traffic; High-speed rail; Regional economy; Siphon effect; Traffic redistribution","air transportation; airline industry; high-speed train; regional economy; research; transportation economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067938288

Therefore, the Chinese government has given high priority to implementing its Natural Forest Program that includes the restoration of degraded secondary forests. Hence, how ecosystem services (ESs)and their trade-offs are altered during the restoration process of secondary forests merits research. Here, we selected five key ecological indicators of forests, namely plant diversity and four ESs—air quality regulation, maintenance of soil fertility, global climate regulation, and timber provisioning—to examine the trends and patterns in the variation of multiple indicators and their trade-offs during forest restoration. Furthermore, secondary forests in subtropical China are characterized by a diverse tree species community that transitions from conifers in the early stage of restoration, to deciduous broadleaf and evergreen broadleaf species in its mid and late stages; this provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the influences of different tree functional groups on ESs and the trade-offs among them. Our results showed that late-forest had a greater capacity to supply higher and more evenly distributed benefits of ESs than did early or mid-stage restored forests. We also found that the magnitude of trade-offs between paired ESs changed with the stage of restoration. Furthermore, the variation of the beneficiary in critical trade-offs corresponded to the patterns of change in benefits of specific ESs. Trade-offs between plant diversity and other ESs were significantly influenced by tree functional group, in that the deciduous broadleaved species had significant positive effects whereas the conifer and evergreen broadleaved species had negative effects. We conclude that accurate prediction and management of ESs in restoration forests should explicitly account for tree functional groups, in addition to the effects from combined trade-offs among multiple ESs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem management; Ecosystem service benefit; Functional group composition; Restoration stage; Trade-off analysis","Air quality; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Forestry; Restoration; Air quality regulations; Ecological indicators; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Group composition; Multiple indicators; Restoration process; Trade-off analysis; Conservation; deciduous forest; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; evergreen forest; forest ecosystem; functional group; restoration ecology; secondary forest; trade-off; China; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065234722

Thus, governmental energy control policies may lead to large reductions in air pollutant emissions. Energy policies can be broadly categorized into two types based on their policy goals. First are emission reduction policies, identified as throttling measures, which aim to reduce emissions from the source; second are renewable energy policies, which are dedicated to the development and promotion of renewable energy. This paper employs a spatial econometric method to empirically test the effects of these two types of energy policies on China's emissions of major air pollutants, namely PM10, PM2.5, and SO2, using panel data from 27 provinces and four direct-controlled municipalities over the period from 2003 to 2016. The results offer evidence that provincial emission reduction policies have positive impacts on reduction of PM10, whereas provincial renewable energy policies have positive impacts on the reduction of SO2 and PM2.5. The results also show that energy policies in one province can influence emissions of pollutants in neighbouring provinces due to policy spillover effects. Several policy implications are made based on the research findings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Emission reduction policy; Energy policies; Major air pollutants; Renewable energy policy","Emission control; Energy policy; Public policy; Air pollutant emission; Air pollutants; Econometric analysis; Emission reduction policies; Governmental energy; Policy implications; Production and consumption; Renewable energy policy; Air pollution; alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; econometrics; emission control; energy policy; panel data; particulate matter; pollution policy; spatial analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066763589

In addition to the provision of biomass feedstocks and pollution remediation, these trees and shrubs have been sustainably grown to conserve or utilize water in a variety of applications. Growing these woody plants for multiple uses supports many of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG6) and Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG7). As a result, focusing on ecosystem services such as freshwater and biomass has become an important aspect of deploying these production systems across variable landscapes.

Therefore, fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission reduction are two main targets of almost all industrial and scientific communities. The key scope of this article is to describe an innovative methodology for the variable-fidelity design optimization of a ship’s hull-propeller system under multiple operating conditions in early-stage ship design. Non-uniform rational basis spline technique and the efficient multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition are, respectively, used to generate variants of hull-propeller designs and minimize the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission as objective functions of the proposed problem. The variable fidelity numerical solvers are also applied for the hydrodynamic evaluation of the design performance during optimization. Three different specific fuel oil consumption data provided by the engine manufacturers Wartsila, MAN B&W and Caterpillar are used to optimize a medium-sized bulk carrier driven by a well-known propeller as the initial design. The numerical results show an improvement in performance of the optimal hull-propeller designs. © IMechE 2018.","CO2 emission; fuel consumption; hull-propeller system; Hydrodynamic optimization; variable fidelity solvers","Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Evolutionary algorithms; Fuel consumption; Fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Hulls (ship); Hydrodynamics; Propellers; Rational functions; Shipbuilding; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emissions; Engine manufacturers; hull-propeller system; Hydrodynamic optimizations; Innovative methodologies; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Variable fidelity; Ship propulsion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053349104

Concurrently, international policies have called for substantial reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the resilience of energy-supply systems has become more important. Consequently, solutions to exhaust locally-available sources must be developed to minimize the fraction of fossil fuels for heating, cooling and electricity. This article shows an example of designing a low-temperature heating and cooling grid based on locally-available renewables and waste heat and introduces general hypotheses concerning smart energy planning in urban development zones. Taking an urban development area in Vienna, Austria, as example, it is shown that wastewater, geothermal and (office) waste heat, solar energy, and the heat content of ambient air can play an important role within a climate-friendly urban energy concept and that heating and cooling demand can be covered completely on-site. From an environmental point of view, the concept is promising, as greenhouse gas emissions and the non-renewable primary energy consumption can be reduced by over 70% compared to conventional gas heating, while, based on current (fossil) energy prices, it is economically not fully competitive. The gap could be closed e.g. by CO2 taxes on fossil energy sources or (temporal) subsidies for renewables. Additionally, reservations of stakeholders in the energy sector against this innovative approach must be dismantled. © 2019 by the authors.","Anergy grid; Cooling; Heating; Low-temperature; PVT; Urban development; Waste heat; Wastewater","Atmospheric temperature; Cooling; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Geothermal energy; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Population statistics; Solar energy; Waste heat; Wastewater; Anergy grid; Fossil energy sources; International policies; Low temperature heating; Low temperatures; Primary energy consumption; Rapid population growth; Urban development; Urban growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072732841

In response to increasing pressures applied by the conflict between supply and demand and the need for emission mitigation, the government has promoted pipeline network reform for years. However, the selection of an appropriate reform scheme is controversial, and no researcher has conducted quantitative analysis on this issue. This paper quantifies the impacts of pipeline network reform on the downstream oil supply chain of China so as to provide policy implications. An integrated evaluation framework is established by coupling a mathematical programming technique with the energy-economy-environment (3E) assessment method. Five future scenarios are designed including the baseline (BAU) and four types of reform policies: third-party access (TPA), pipeline network integration (PNI), business cooperation (BC) and third-party access combined with business cooperation (TPA-BC). The results indicate that (i) all reform schemes have significant benefits for aspects of 3E; (ii) the scenarios can be ranked by 3E performance as follows: TPA-BC > BC > PNI > TPA > BAU; and (iii) only when the pipeline networks need to reserve a high capacity margin can the advantages of PNI compared to TPA be revealed; otherwise, the gap between them is small. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Downstream oil supply chain; Economy; Energy; Environment; Linear programming; Pipeline network reform","Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Linear programming; Low power electronics; Public policy; Supply chains; Economy; Energy; Environment; Oil supply chain; Pipeline networks; Pipelines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067827075

The implementation of total carbon emission control for civil buildings is an important means to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction in China. The study divides civil buildings into urban residential buildings, rural residential buildings, public buildings, and northern urban heating. The study calculates and predicts the total carbon emissions of China's civil buildings. Firstly, according to the statistical method of IPCC, the calculation model of carbon emissions of civil buildings is constructed, and the total amount of carbon emissions of civil buildings in China from 2005 to 2016 is calculated by using the energy balance table. Further, based on the improved grey prediction method, the national civil use from 2017 to 2025 is predicted. Total carbon emissions from construction. The forecast results show that in 2017-2025, the annual average carbon emission growth rate of buildings is about 4.65%, and by 2025, the total emission is expected to reach 298.176 million tons of CO2. In order to achieve the 2030 emission reduction target, it is necessary to further optimize the energy structure, improve the energy efficiency of the building, and increase the carbon emission reduction in civil construction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Emission control; Forecasting; Historic preservation; Housing; Manufacture; Calculation models; Carbon emission reductions; Civil constructions; Emission reduction targets; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Rural residential buildings; Total amount of carbons; Urban residential buildings; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073523141

Secondly, a Grey Model (GM) was constructed to predict the growth trend of CO2 emissions, FDI and R&amp;D in China from 2018 to 2030. It was deduced that: (1) FDI do bring negative effects on industrial CO2 emissions at the national level. From the perspective of regions, the coefficients of the eastern, central and western regions are all negatively correlated with CO2 emissions and pass the test of 1% significance level except the northeastern China. (2) In terms of R&amp;D, it showed significantly improvement on CO2 emissions at the national and regional levels. Moreover, the efficiency of industrial CO2 emissions was improved by R&amp;D with a rate of 27.2%, while the related value was increased by FDI with a rate of merely 4.3% at the national level. (3) According to the results of GM (1,1), China is expected to achieve zero growth of CO2 emissions by 2030.

It is a solution to reduce the emissions of auxiliary engines at berth and to improve the local and regional air quality. This paper develops a multi-objective model that integrates spatial and temporal dimensions for strategic planning regarding whether and when to retrofit ships to use SSE. The strategic planning problem is to maximize the environmental benefit and to minimize the payback period of the investment over the entire planning horizon. By adopting an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), a series of retrofit strategies for container ships calling at Dalian Port in China are obtained under a projected annual visiting frequency of ships with different ship sizes and shipping lines. Depending on a selected retrofit strategy, the sum of the payback periods of ships that are determined to be retrofitted is 46 years (on average less than four years) and the environmental benefit of using SSE can be up to 128 million USD for Dalian Port in the planning horizon from 2020 to 2035. The results show that using SSE is an efficient method to decline emissions within the maritime sector and validate that the proposed methodology can be useful to ship owners to decide upon investing in SSE applications and to promote the development of green shipping and green ports. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Green port; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Ship retrofitting; Shore side electricity","Air quality; Environmental protection; Genetic algorithms; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Retrofitting; Strategic planning; Environmental benefits; Green ports; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Multi-objective modeling; Regional air quality; Retrofit strategies; Strategy development; Temporal dimensions; Ships; container ship; development strategy; electricity supply; genetic algorithm; optimization; port operation; ship design; shipping; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070318976

One of the most efficient methods in this regard is the use of low cement systems, the so-called low cement concrete (LCC). Although eco-efficient, the use of structural LCC is somewhat new and its performance and long-term behaviour are still relatively unknown. This project aims to mix-proportion concrete mixtures with reduced amount of cement through particle packing models (PPMs). Fresh and hardened state evaluations are performed on mixtures with distinct carbon footprint while gaps, recommendations, and further needs are highlighted. Results indicate that PPMs enable the development of LCC systems with suitable performance in the hardened state while presenting reasonably small environmental impact. Otherwise, particular attention should be taken in the fresh state properties of highly packed granular systems, which might be improved through the use of admixtures, fillers and supplementary cementing materials. • PPMs are able to improve the hardened state properties of conventional concrete mixtures. • Abrams' Law is not the only factor setting the mechanical properties of PPM mix-designed mixes. • PPMs enable the development of high performance low cement content systems. • Particular attention should be given to low cement content systems in the fresh state. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alfred model; Binder intensity factor (bi); Low cement concrete (LCC); Maximum paste thickness (MPT); Particle packing models (PPMs)","Carbon footprint; Cement industry; Cements; Concrete mixtures; Construction industry; Environmental impact; Hardening; Mixtures; Binder intensities; Conventional concrete; Granular system; Long term behaviours; Low-cement concrete; Particle packing models; Paste thickness; Supplementary cementing materials; Mechanical properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067208467

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an essential component in aquatic ecosystems and regulates the carbon and nutrient cycle, but its characteristics in highly polluted urban rivers are still not well understood. Here, water samples from the mainstream, tributaries, ponds, and reservoirs within the highly urbanized Maozhou River watershed (Shenzhen, China) were analyzed using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, stable carbon isotope analysis, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) to explore the impact of urbanization on DOM characteristics. The results showed elevated dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the disturbed waters (mainstream, tributary, and pond) compared to those in the reservoir water. Results of the spectroscopic, isotopic, and FT-ICR MS analyses suggest that disturbed water DOM had lower aromaticity, average molecular weight, and plant- and soil-derived terrestrial (e.g., lignin-like) contributions but greater contributions from microbial-derived protein-like and anthropogenic sulfur-containing compounds (e.g., synthetic surfactants) than those of reservoir DOM. These characteristics were strengthened from the upper to the lower mainstream, which implies greater anthropogenic impact on downstream waters. Point-source wastewater effluent input caused increases in DOM level in the mainstream water and abrupt changes in DOM characteristics with very strong anthropogenic characteristics. The distinct chemistry of urban DOM from natural organic matter highlights a potentially strong impact of rapid urbanization on carbon and nutrient cycle in aquatic ecosystems.

In this study, we present how Indigenous belief and knowledge system can frame the application of a modeling tool (Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator). We focus on managing forest ecosystem services of the Diné (Navajo) Nation as a case study. Most Diné tribal members depend directly on the land for their livelihoods and cultural traditions. The forest plays a vital role in Diné livelihoods through social, cultural, spiritual, subsistence, and economic factors. We simulated forest dynamics over time under alternative climate change scenarios and management strategies to identify forest management strategies that will maintain future ecosystem services. We initialized the Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator model with data from permanent plots and site-specific growth models under multiple management systems (no-management, thinning, burning, and assisted migration planting) and different climate scenarios (no-climate-change, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0). Projections of climate change show average losses of basal area by over 65% by 2105, a shift in tree species composition to drier-adapted species, and a decrease in species diversity. While substantial forest loss was inevitable under the warming climate scenarios, the modeling framework allowed us to evaluate the management treatments, including planting, for conserving multiple tree species in mixed conifer forests, thus providing an anchor for biodiversity. We presented the modeling results and management implications and discuss how they can complement Diné kinship concepts. Our approach is a useful step for framing modern science with Indigenous Knowledge and for developing improved strategies to sustain natural resources and livelihoods. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","Arizona; climate–forest vegetation simulator; fire; indigenous community; Navajo; New Mexico; resilience; tree diversity","biodiversity; climate change; coniferous forest; ecosystem service; forest dynamics; forest ecosystem; forest fire; forest management; indigenous knowledge; indigenous population; native species; simulator; species diversity; strategic approach; tree; Arizona; Navajo County; New Mexico; United States; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; forest; tree; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Forests; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071757178

However, the effects of soil erosion and reforestation on soil respiration (SR), and soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the changes in SR, and SOC and TN stocks at four different soil erosion levels (severely, moderately, lightly, and non-eroded) and two different aged Pinus massoniana plantations (8- and 36-year-old) in the hilly red soil regions of Southern China. Our results showed that soil erosion level and reforestation significantly influenced SR, and SOC and TN stocks. Meanwhile, the mean SR, and SOC and TN stocks all significantly decreased with erosion level but increased significantly with times since reforestation. Soil temperature (ST) could explain 70–92% of SR seasonal variation based on exponential models, whereas no significant relationship between SR and soil water content were found. Furthermore, the structural equation modeling indicated that SOC stocks at 0–20 cm had a much stronger effect on SR than ST. Meanwhile, the SOC stocks for 0–20 cm increased by 177% and 558% in the 8- and 36-year-old Pinus massoniana plantations in comparison with the severely eroded forestland, respectively. This study highlights that reforestation could be an effective strategy for restoring the carbon and nitrogen storage in eroded regions of Southern China and emphasizes the need to consider the effects of soil erosion and reforestation when assessing regional carbon budgets under different climate scenarios. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","C storage; N storage; Pinus massoniana; Soil CO2 efflux; Soil temperature; Water erosion","Budget control; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Reforestation; Soil moisture; Temperature; Carbon and nitrogen; CO2 efflux; Pinus massoniana; Soil organic carbon; Soil temperature; Structural equation modeling; Terrestrial ecosystems; Water erosion; Erosion; nitrogen; organic carbon; carbon sequestration; coniferous tree; reforestation; soil carbon; soil erosion; soil nitrogen; soil respiration; soil temperature; water erosion; Article; China; climate; environmental impact; Pinus massoniana; plantation; priority journal; reforestation; seasonal variation; soil erosion; soil respiration; soil temperature; soil water content; structural equation modeling; vegetation; China; Pinus massoniana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065909868

This paper studied the potential reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions across China if corn stover was used for ethanol production. Field surveys in nine provincial regions were conducted. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) was used to assess the GHG and PM2.5 emissions from a corn stover based ethanol system. The LCA system boundaries included several process stages from corn planting to ethanol fuel used in vehicles. Corn stover geographical distributions and emission reduction factors were combined. Results showed that the total surplus quantity of corn stover in China was 86.2 million metric tons (Mt) in 2015. It was sufficient to reach the ethanol production target set by the Chinese government. In the scenario that 38.5 Mt or 44.6% of corn stover surplus were used for ethanol production, the total potential emission reductions were 36.5 Mt CO2-eq GHG and 450.9 kt PM2.5. Among the 31 provincial regions in China, the reduction potentials varied from 0.001 to 8.9 Mt CO2-eq for GHG and from 0.013 to 109.7 kt for PM2.5.

Plant functional diversity is benefit to improve plant photosynthesis and enhance C efficiency and therefore decrease CO2. Here, the focus of this article is on integrating of plant functional diversity and C storage, which aims to contribute to C sequestration for climate change mitigation following vegetation restoration in Loess Plateau, China. Firstly, the CWM (plant community-weighted mean) traits of the most abundant plant species can account for C storage in AGBC (above-ground biomass C), ALC (above-ground litter C), STC (soil total carbon) and TEC (total ecosystem carbon). Secondly, the CWM of plant height and LCC (leaf carbon concentration) had a positive effect C storage in different part (AGBC, ALC, STC and TEC), while the CWM of LNC (leaf nitrogen concentration) and SLA (specific leaf area) had a negative effect on C storage in different part. Further, the CWM of plant height, LCC, SLA and plant functional dispersion (FDis) can be used to predict C storage by multiple linear regression analysis. Finally, the positive association between FDis and C storage was found in SEM, shedding light on the key role of plant functional diversity driving C storage following vegetation restoration. The findings presented here highlight the importance of both plant traits of dominant species and plant functional diversity in regulating C storage, and show that favorable climate conditions, particularly vegetation restoration, tend to increase C storage and plant functional diversity, which have important implications for improving global C cycling and ecosystem services. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","C storage; Functional diversity; Loess plateau; Structural equation model; Vegetation restoration","carbon; nitrogen; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecological modeling; ecosystem service; restoration ecology; species diversity; vegetation type; Article; carbon storage; China; climate change; concentration (parameter); nonhuman; plant; plant height; plant leaf; revegetation; species diversity; biomass; ecosystem; human; plant; soil; China; Loess Plateau; Biomass; China; Ecosystem; Humans; Plants; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067668125

This paper establishes the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions elasticity indicators of technical and final demand coefficients from the demand perspective as well as allocation and primary input coefficients from the supply perspective, based on the input–output technique combined with sensitivity analysis. We apply these indicators to the Chinese economy for the year 2012. The results show that with every 1% decrease of self-supplied intermediate products in the Production and supply of electricity and heat and Smelting and pressing of ferrous metals (the two largest CO2 emitting sectors) could reduce CO2 emissions from the whole economy by 20.6 Mt and 11.3 Mt from the demand perspective, accounting for 0.22% and 0.12% of the national total CO2 emissions, respectively. It could also mitigate 22.2 Mt and 8.7 Mt from the supply perspective, accounting for 0.24% and 0.09% of the national total, respectively. In addition, 1% decrease of final demand coefficient of the Construction in Capital Formation could exert great indirect effects on many sectors, and lead to 37.4 Mt (0.40%) emission reduction from the whole economy. The absolute reduction due to the variation of primary input coefficients is relatively small. By analyzing these important intersectoral linkages of CO2 emissions within the economy from both demand and supply perspectives, the most important economic transactions between sectors as well as supply and demand patterns to reduce emissions are identified. These results can help guide the development of potential effective emission mitigation policies and the methods can also be applied to other countries and regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","China; CO2 emissions; Coefficient variation; Elasticity; Input–output analysis","Economics; Elasticity; Emission control; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon dioxide emissions; China; CO2 emissions; Coefficient variation; Economic transactions; Emission reduction targets; Output analysis; Structural variations; Carbon dioxide; metal; carbon emission; demand elasticity; electricity supply; emission control; environmental economics; input-output analysis; pollution policy; sensitivity analysis; Article; carbon footprint; China; economic aspect; elasticity; electricity; heat; policy; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065921514

In addition, cycling provides other environmental benefits, such as reducing air pollution and traffic congestion. Various built environment factors have been demonstrated to be associated with the popularity of cycling behaviors. However, the most recent built environment cycling reviews were conducted nearly 10 years ago, and these reviews reached no clear consensus on which built environment factors are associated with which domain of cycling behaviors. To determine the crucial features of a cycling-friendly city, it is therefore necessary to conduct a review based on empirical studies from the last decade (2007–2017). Methods: Thirty-nine empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 2007 and 2017 were retrieved and reviewed. The results were summarized based on built environment factors and four domains of cycling behaviors (transport, commuting, recreation, and general). Weighted elasticity values for built environment factors were calculated to estimate effect sizes. Results: We found consistent associations with large effect sizes between street connectivity and cycling for commuting and transport. The presence of cycling paths and facilities was found to be positively associated with both commuting cycling and general cycling. However, the effects of land-use mix, availability of cycling paths to non-residential destinations, and terrain slope on cycling behaviors remained weak. The effects of urban density and other built environment factors are mixed. Conclusions: This review has demonstrated that street connectivity and the presence of cycling paths and facilities are the two most significant built environment factors that may promote cycling behaviors. With the emergence of advanced measurement methods for both the built environment and cycling behaviors, further studies may overcome current research limitations and provide robust evidence to support urban planning and public-health practice. © 2019 The Authors","Built environment; Cycling; Healthy city; Physical activity; Urban design; Urban planning",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071117637

These schemes alleviate urban traffic congestion, reduce carbon emissions, and change people's preferred travel modes, but they also suffer from a series of problems related to unsustainability. The sustainability performance of a DBSP is closely related to its influencing factors, which can be used to understand the main challenges of the program and consider what useful measures should be taken to overcome these issues. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the related factors that are critical to the sustainability of DBSPs from a systems-level perspective. In this paper, we explored publicly available data sources (i.e., literature, institutional reports, and announcements) to determine the intrinsic influencing factors and understand their interactions and feedback relationships. A taxonomy of the key challenges with respect to the fundamental pillars of DBSP sustainability (i.e., environment, society, and economy) was provided. System dynamics methodology was employed to map the critical factors and links in order to analyze the key challenges in facilitating the sustainability of DBSPs. Based on this approach, we put forward proposals to mitigate the severe challenges for governments and DBSP operators. The findings provide a theoretical basis and guiding role to develop improvement strategies for DBSP sustainability. © 2019 by the authors.","Causal loop; Dockless bike-sharing; Influencing factors; Supply chains; Sustainability; System dynamics","economic conditions; methodology; strategic approach; supply chain management; sustainability; traffic congestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071985441

Exposure to hazardous PM2.5 would not only trigger human health impact, but also result in an economic loss for both society and individual. In this study, the PM2.5-related health impact and corresponding economic loss are assessed in typical cities from north part of China. In these cities, huge amount of energy is consumed for space heating during the cold days, which has been proven to be the major contributor to PM2.5 emissions. Considering the remarkable difference of space heating utilization and average PM2.5 concentration, the study examines the health and welfare impact of PM2.5 exposure in both winter season and summer season from 2013 to 2016. Adjusted human capital method and the cost of illness are applied to assess the economic loss of premature death and medical expenses on PM2.5-related diseases, respectively. Welfare loss is proposed to quantify the financial damages caused by PM2.5 to the individual, which is calculated based on the proportion of health care expenses in disposable personal income. The results show that the number of cases for PM2.5-related mortality and morbidity during the winter season is about three times as much as that in summer season in 28 cities. If the annual average PM2.5 concentration has decreased from the current polluted condition to 35 μg/m3 (national health standard), about 16.46 billion Yuan, 0.54% of gross domestic product in 28 cities can be saved annually during the study period. The welfare loss in cities of provincial capital is obviously higher than other cities from the same province, which is associated with the higher consumption level and living quality of capital cities. Moreover, patients requiring hospital admission from rural household are more likely to be impoverished than that from urban household, which aggravates the economic burden of rural residents to recover from the suffer of PM2.5-related diseases. Estimation of the health impact and economic losses for the society and individual represent an integral part of a full analysis of the consequences of PM2.5 exposure to human beings, which can provide some insightful observations for policy makers to keep the social equality, welfare and environment conservation. © 2019","Air pollution; Economic loss; Human health impact; Welfare loss","Air pollution; Cost accounting; Diseases; Economic analysis; Heating; Losses; Space heating; Economic loss; Environment conservation; Gross domestic products; Hospital admissions; Human health impacts; PM2.5 concentration; Production and consumption; Welfare loss; Economic and social effects; atmospheric pollution; cost analysis; economic impact; Gross Domestic Product; health care; health impact; human capital; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065210780

Facing the challenges of meeting 2030 peak target of CO2 emission and realizing the coordinated development of thermal power generation in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, this paper applies generalized Divisia Index Method (GDIM) to decompose the dynamics in the relevant CO2 emission. The effects of five factors including electricity demand, energy consumption, technology, energy efficiency and energy-mix are considered. The decomposition suggests that electricity demand is the primary factor driving the CO2 emission up, whereas technology effect decreases CO2 emission the most. Given the significant roles of technology, energy-mix and energy efficiency in CO2 emissions reduction, seven scenarios are designed to identify the optimal coordinated development pathway for thermal power generation in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Through upgrading energy structure and/or enhancing energy efficiency, the thermal power generation in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region can achieve coordinated development and realize the 2030 peak target under four scenarios.

Uncovering the driving forces of CO2 emissions, thus, is of great significance to provide appropriate mitigation policies for the sustainable development of China's thermal electricity generation. In this regard, this study aims to fill a research gap by applying Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) approach via the Generalized Divisia Index Model (GDIM) to examine the driving factors behind the CO2 emission changes in China's thermal electricity generation during 2000–2016. The decomposition results indicate that the factors contributing to the growth in CO2 emission can be ranked as follows: economic activity (52.0%), electricity demand (45.8%) and energy use (36.2%), whereas factors suppressing the growth in the mission are carbon intensity change (−17.7%), technology (−11.3%), energy mix (−2.4%), energy efficiency (−1.7%) and electricity efficiency (−0.9%). Noteworthy, the promoting effect of the economic activity varied little with time, whereas that of electricity demand and energy use exhibited a downward trend in general. Besides, though the progress in technology contributed a lot to the decrease of CO2 emission, its decreasing effects tended to diminish since 2013. Northeast and East regions appeared as those contributing to the mitigation of the CO2 emissions from China's thermal electricity generation, whereas the North and Northwest regions exerted a lag to the abatement of CO2 emission. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Generalized Divisia Index Model; Index Decomposition Analysis; Thermal electricity generation","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Carbon dioxide emissions; Divisia index; Electricity efficiencies; Electricity generation; Index decomposition analyses (IDA); Index decomposition analysis; Mitigation policies; Thermal electricity; Electric power generation; carbon; carbon dioxide; abatement cost; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal-fired power plant; decomposition analysis; economic analysis; electricity generation; energy policy; governance approach; mitigation; sustainable development; thermal power; Article; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; decomposition; economic aspect; electricity; energy; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; Index Decomposition Analysis; intermethod comparison; mathematical model; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Structural Decomposition Analysis; thermal analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066035772

The reaction rate equation of the batch-wise biosystem was generally derived by ordered Bi Bi mechanism of two-substrate enzyme reaction on several reasonable assumptions. The rate equations of the batch-wise biosystem was generalized by transforming them into the dimensionless forms. The dimensionless forms were solved numerically. It was revealed that the batch-wise biosystem was generally made up of unique 3 phases, i.e., phases I, II and III. Phase I was very short transient so that the biosystem entered rapidly phase II. In phase II the consumption rate dynamically balanced with its formation rate so that the concentration of NAD(P)H was invariable with time (and hence NAD(P)+ concentration was, too). Phase III was substrate-exhausting phase, and the coenzyme concentration became finally only [NAD(P)+] or only [NAD(P)H] depending on the initial molar ratio of the prochiral carbonyl compound to the substrate of the coenzyme regeneration reaction ([S]0/[S′]0) &gt; or &lt;1.0.

By implementing a set of air pollution mitigation measures, the air quality of Beijing has been gradually improved in recent years. In this study, the intrinsic factors leading to air quality improvement in Beijing are studied via a quantitative evaluation of the temporal and spatial changes in emissions of primary air pollutants over the past ten years. Based on detailed activity levels of each economic sector and a localized database containing source and pollutant specific emission factors, an integrated emissions inventory of primary air pollutants discharged from various sources between 2006 and 2015 is established. With the implementation of phased air pollution mitigation measures, and the Clean Air Action Plan, the original coal-dominated energy structure in Beijing has undergone tremendous changes, resulting in the substantial reduction of multiple air pollutants. The total of emissions of six major atmospheric pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NOX, VOCs and NH3) in Beijing decreased by 35% in 2015 compared to 2006-this noticeable decrease was well consistent with the declining trend of ambient concentration of criterion air pollutants (SO2, PM10, PM2.5 and NO2) and air quality improvement, thus showing a good correlation between the emission of air pollutants and the outcome of air quality. SO2 emission declined the most, at about 71.7%, which was related to the vigorous promotion of combustion source control, such as the shutdown of coal-fired facilities and domestic stoves and transition to clean energy, like natural gas or electricity. Emissions of PM decreased considerably (by 48%) due to energy structure optimization, industrial structure adjustments, and end-of-pipePMsource control. In general,NOX,NH3, and VOCs decreased relatively slightly, by 25%, 14%, and 2%, respectively, and accordingly, they represented the limiting factors for improving air quality and the key points of air pollution mitigation in Beijing for the future. © 2019 by the authors.","Air pollution mitigation measures; Emission inventory; Primary air pollutants; Temporal and spatial distribution characteristics; Transformation of coal to natural gas or electricity","Air quality; Ammonia; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal fired boilers; Industrial emissions; Natural gas; Plant shutdowns; Structural optimization; Air quality improvement; Emission inventories; Industrial structure adjustments; Pollution mitigation; Primary air; Spatio-temporal variation; Temporal and spatial changes; Temporal and spatial distribution; Quality control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; emission inventory; mitigation; particulate matter; pollutant transport; source apportionment; spatiotemporal analysis; volatile organic compound; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072255869

Nevertheless, very few studies have investigated the environmental consequences of China's fossil fuels at both the national and regional levels. For this purpose, this study explores the dynamic relationships among CO2 emissions, economic growth, and consumption of various fossil fuels (i.e., coal, petroleum, and natural gas) in China, using the panel dataset of 30 provinces for the period 1997–2015. Considering the significant differences across various regions, the whole sample and different regions in China are analyzed separately. The estimated results, at both the national and regional levels, provide strong evidence in favor of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for CO2 emissions in China. Furthermore, increasing coal and petroleum consumption significantly promotes CO2 emissions. Conversely, natural gas offers a cleaner substitute for other fossil fuels (i.e., coal and petroleum); its substitution effect may be influenced by the share of natural gas in the total energy needs. Finally, the above findings highlight several policy implications for the Chinese government's policymakers to effectively reduce CO2 emissions in China, thereby setting the nation on a sustainable development path. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","China; CO2 emissions; environmental Kuznets curve; fossil fuels; regional analysis","carbon emission; fossil fuel; Kuznets curve; national strategy; panel data; pollution policy; regional planning; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062501821

In this study, we developed a module for least-cost control strategy optimization based on a real-time prediction system of the responses of pollution concentrations to emissions changes and marginal cost curves of pollutant controls. Different from other method, in this study the relationship between pollution concentrations to and precursor emissions was derived from multiple air quality simulations in which the nonlinear interactions among different precursor emissions can be well addressed. Hypothetical control pathways were designed to attain certain air quality goals for particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region under the 2014 baseline emission level. Results suggest that reducing local primary PM emissions was the most cost-efficient method to attain the ambient PM2.5 standard, whereas for O3 attainment, reducing regional emission sources of gaseous pollutants (i.e., SO2, NOx, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) exhibited greater effectiveness. NH3 controls may be cost-efficient in achieving strengthened PM2.5 targets; however, they might not help in reducing O3. To achieve both PM2.5 (&lt;35 μg m−3) and O3 (daily 1-h maxima concentration &lt; 100 ppb) targets in Beijing, the reduced rates in BTH regions of NOx, SO2, NH3, VOCs and primary PM are 75%, 75%, 5%, 55%, and 85%, respectively from the emission levels in the year of 2014. Local reduction is the most effective method of attaining moderate PM2.5 and O3 targets; however, to achieve more aggressive air quality goals, the same level of reductions must be conducted across the whole Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Air quality attainment; Control strategy; Fine particles; Least-cost optimization; Ozone","air quality; optimization; ozone; particulate matter; pollution control; strategic approach; volatile organic compound; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; air pollutant; air pollution; China; cost control; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cost Control; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066125277

This study compares the PM2.5 and ozone pollution-related health impacts based on an integrated approach. The research framework combines an air pollutant emission projection model (GAINS), an air quality model (GEOS-Chem), a health model using the latest exposure-response functions, medical prices and value of statistical life (VSL), and a general equilibrium model (CGE). Results show that eastern provinces in China encounter severer loss from PM2.5 and more benefit from mitigation policy, whereas the lower income western provinces encounter severer health impacts and economic burdens due to ozone pollution, and the impact in southern and central provinces is relatively lower. In 2030, without control policies, PM 2.5 pollution could lead to losses of 2.0% in Gross Domestic Production (GDP), 210 billion Chinese Yuan (CNY) in health expenditure and a life loss of around 10,000 billion, while ozone pollution could contribute to GDP loss by 0.09% (equivalent to 78 billion CNY), 310 billion CNY in health expenditure, and a life loss of 2300 billion CNY (equivalent to 2.7% of GDP). By contrast, with control policies, the GDP and VSLs loss in 2030 attributable to ambient air pollution could be reduced significantly. We also find that the health and economic impacts of ozone pollution are significantly lower than PM2.5, but are much more difficult to mitigate. The Chinese government should promote air pollution control policies that could jointly reduce PM2.5 and ozone pollution. © 2019 The Authors","Economic impact; Health assessment; IMED model; PM2.5 and ozone pollution","Air quality; Artificial life; Economic and social effects; Health; Ozone; Air pollutant emission; Ambient air pollution; Economic impacts; General equilibrium models; Gross domestic productions; Health assessments; Ozone pollution; Value of statistical lives; Air pollution control; ozone; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; economic impact; environmental impact assessment; general equilibrium analysis; health impact; ozone; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution monitoring; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; China; controlled study; environmental economics; environmental exposure; environmental policy; gross national product; health care cost; human; human impact (environment); particulate matter; priority journal; adverse event; air pollutant; economics; theoretical model; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Ozone; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067074205

The data used in this paper was extracted from these reports and applied to generate a study of the development of greenhouse gas emissions in the waste management sector. The results show a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for developed contries/regions from 1990 to 2016 due to improved collection and treatment of landfill gas, a shift from landfilling to biological and thermal treatment, as well as a shift to separate waste collection and treatment. The developing countries and regions show another development of greenhouse gas emissions. On the one hand, their greenhouse gas emissions from the waste sector strongly increased due to higher generation of waste. And on the other hand, they increased due in most cases to unorganized and technically insufficent disposal of mixed waste on dumpsites along with better observation of disposal sites and therefore better registration of emissions. Nevertheless, the per capita emissions in developed countries/regions are with approx. 500 kg CO2-eq./a much higher than for developing and emerging countries/regions, which just emit around 100 kg CO2-eq./a. © 2019 Cisa Publisher.","Global warming; Greenhouse gas emissions; National Inventory Reports",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087830248

Fugitive dust can potentially cause respiratory illness and lung damage for humans, and even lead to premature death in sensitive individuals. Aiming to reduce the fugitive dust emission on unpaved roads, scientists did various lab experiences to analyse the performance of different types of dust suppressants mixed with different soils. In our previous papers, we evaluated the co-polymer-based dust suppressant (CPS) mixed with loamy sand (soils are from Sedona, Arizona) and silty clay (SP-SC) (soils are from Flagstaff, Arizona). The objective of this paper is to analyse the efficiency of fugitive dust reduction and present the quantitative laboratory evaluation of CPS mixed with poorly sand (SP). The soils were sampled from Page, Arizona. Soil classification is based on United Soil Classification System (USCS). Four concentrations of CPS (0%, 1%, 3%, and 5% by weight) were diluted and mixed with soil samples to prepared soil specimens. A series of laboratory experiences were performed on the soil specimens including moisture retention test, surface strength test, dynamic rolling test, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. The laboratory results show that the higher the concentration of CPS is, the better CPS performs, and CPS with 5% concentration by weight controls the dust emissions better as compared with the other three concentrations, provided the results from the moisture retention rate, surface strength, dynamic rolling resistance, and interlock/cohesion effect in SEM images are promising. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air pollution; Dust control; Laboratories; Memory architecture; Moisture; Scanning electron microscopy; Soils; Urban planning; Weight control; Construction sites; Fugitive dust emissions; Laboratory evaluation; Laboratory experiences; Laboratory performance evaluation; Moisture retention; Respiratory illness; Soil classification; Soil pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072968685

In this study, PM2.5 samples were collected from two sites at different distances from the shipping channel of Xiamen Port in southeastern China between November 2015 and May 2018 and analyzed for their chemical compositions, which included water-soluble ions, carbonaceous species, and elements. The average annual PM2.5 mass concentrations were 55.8 ± 22.7 µg m–3 and 56.5 ± 24.5 µg m–3 at the urban and suburban sites, respectively, with the lowest values in summer and the highest in winter/spring. Significantly higher values for vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) were found at the urban site due to the shorter distance between this location and the shipping channel. Using a PMF model, six source factors were identified: sulfate and shipping emissions (16.6–20.9%), secondary nitrate and chloride (14.7–17.3%), fugitive dust (16.9–23.0%), industrial emissions (5.5–7.0%), primary organic aerosol (14.1–14.8%), and traffic emissions and biomass burning (23.8–24.6%). Potential source contribution function analysis indicated that air masses from the South China Sea contributed significantly to the shipping emissions. The PMF-based method did not distinguish primary shipping emissions from secondary sulfate. When a V-based method was used, the primary PM2.5 from shipping emissions plus its associated secondary sulfate was shown to contribute 5.5–8.9% of the ambient PM2.5 on average. The results from the V-based method exhibited strong positive correlations with those of the PMF-based method. Considering the potential negative effect on air quality and the expanding international maritime trade in the long term, our research indicates that policies and regulations for controlling shipping emissions are necessary in all major port cities, including those outside the domestic emission control areas of China. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","PM2.5; PMF; Shipping emissions; Source apportionment; Vanadium","Air quality; Chemical analysis; Chlorine compounds; Emission control; Quality control; Ships; Sulfur compounds; Vanadium; Vanadium compounds; Carbonaceous species; Chemical compositions; PM2.5; Positive correlations; Potential negative effects; Potential source contribution function; Shipping emissions; Source apportionment; Urban growth; aerosol composition; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; chloride; dust; nitrate; particulate matter; shipping; source apportionment; suburban area; China; Fujian; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Xiamen Bay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073384583

In this study, atmospheric concentrations of NH3 and water-soluble ion composition in PM2.5 as well as nitrogen isotope ratios in NH4 + (δ15N-NH4 +) in Xiamen, China, were measured. Results showed that average NH3 concentration for the five sites in Xiamen was 7.9 μg m−3 with distinct higher values in the warm season and lower values in the cold season, and PM2.5 concentration for the two sites (urban and suburban) was 59.2 μg m−3 with lowest values in summer. In the PM2.5, NH4 + concentrations were much lower than NH3 and showed a stronger positive correlation with NO3 − than that with SO4 2− suggesting the formation of NH4NO3 and equilibrium between NH3 and NH4 +. Although the concentrations of NH3 at the urban site were significantly higher than those at the suburban site, no significant spatial difference in NH4 + and δ15N-NH4 + was obtained. The distinct heavier δ15N-NH4 + values in summer than in other seasons correlated well with the equilibrium isotopic effects between NH3 and NH4 + which depend on temperature. The initial δ15N-NH3 values were in the range of waste treatment (− 25.42‰) and fossil fuel combustion (− 2.5‰) after accounting for the isotope fractionation. The stable isotope mixing model showed that fossil fuel–related NH3 emissions (fossil fuel combustion and NH3 slip) contributed more than 70% to aerosol NH4 +. This finding suggested that the reduction of NH3 emissions from urban transportation and coal combustion should be a priority in the abatement of PM2.5 pollution in Xiamen. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ammonia; Ammonium; Non-agricultural source; PM2.5; Stable nitrogen isotope ratio","agricultural emission; ammonia; ammonium compound; isotopic composition; isotopic ratio; nitrogen isotope; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution effect; stable isotope; China; Fujian; Xiamen; ammonia; ammonium derivative; coal; fossil fuel; nitrogen; aerosol; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; procedures; season; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Ammonia; Ammonium Compounds; China; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Fossil Fuels; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Isotopes; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069629277

Over the past two decades, the explosive growth of CPPs has led to negative air quality and health impacts in China, and a series of control policies have been implemented to alleviate those impacts. In this work, by combining a CPPs emission database over China (CPED), a regional chemical transport model (WRF-CMAQ), and the integrated exposure-response model, we summarized historical and ongoing emission control policies on CPPs over China, investigated the air quality and health impacts of China's CPPs during 2005-2020, and quantified the benefits of each policy. We found that despite the 97.4% growth of coal-fired power generation during 2005-2015, PM2.5 exposures caused by emissions from China's CPPs decreased from 9.0 μg m-3 in 2005 to 3.6 μg m-3 in 2015. The active emission control policies have decreased CPPs-induced PM2.5 exposures by 10.0 μg m-3 during 2005-2015. We estimated that upgrading end-of-pipe control facilities and early retirement of small and low-efficiency units could respectively reduce PM2.5 exposures by 7.9 and 2.1 μg m-3 during 2005-2015 and avoid 111 900 and 31 400 annual premature deaths. Since 2015, China's government has further required all CPPs to comply with the so-called 'ultra-low emission standards' before 2020 as a major component of China's clean air actions. If the policy is fully deployed, CPPs-induced PM2.5 exposures could further decrease by 2.5 μg m-3 and avoid 43 500 premature deaths annually. Our study confirms the effectiveness of tailored control policies for China's CPPs and reveals that those policies have played important roles in air quality improvement in China. © 2019 The Author(s).

In this method, a single-phase precursor TiCnO1-n was firstly prepared from the reaction between titanium dioxide and carbon black in argon atmosphere. Then, the precursor was used as raw materials to prepare TiN, TiCxN1-x or TiC. For the production of TiN or TiCxN1-x, the precursor was further carbothermally reduced and nitrided in nitrogen gas atmosphere. For the production of TiC, the precursor was further reduced by carbon in vacuum. In the first reduction step, it was hard to determine the precise molar ratio of TiO2:C due to the uncontrollable ratio of gaseous products CO and CO2 from TiO2 to TiCnO1-n. Whereas the second step only took place in the high temperature region and the gaseous products were thermodynamically in favor of CO. Therefore, the expected products can be obtained by precisely controlling the carbon addition after analyzing the contents of carbon and oxygen in TiCnO1-n. High purity products were prepared with good dispersivity, narrow size distribution and controllable atomic ratio of C:N. The effects of reduction temperature, reaction time, ball milling and particle sizes of raw material TiO2 were studied in detail. TiN, TiCxN1-x and TiC could be obtained under the same optimum time and temperature of 1773 K for 4 h in first step and 1873 K for 8 h in second step. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Carbothermal reduction; Titanium carbide; Titanium carbonitride; Titanium nitride","Ball milling; Carbon black; Carbon nitride; Carbothermal reduction; Molar ratio; Titanium carbide; Titanium dioxide; Argon atmospheres; Carbon addition; Gaseous products; High temperature; High-purity products; Narrow size distributions; Reduction temperatures; Titanium carbonitrides; Titanium nitride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069940967

The natural abundance composition of 15N/14N in plants and soils (termed as δ15Nplant and δ15Nsoil), as well as the difference between them (δ15Nsoil-to-plant = δ15Nplant −δ15Nsoil), is a useful tool for better understanding ecosystem N cycling. However, the drivers and mechanisms of ecosystem N cycling in alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau are mostly unknown, especially across different grassland types at a regional scale. To fill this knowledge gap, we measured δ15Nplant (200 samples of top-dominant species) and δ15Nsoil (85 samples of top-layer soils, 0–20 cm) at nine sites that represent zonal communities of alpine deserts, steppes, and meadows in North Tibet, and calculated the corresponding δ15Nsoil-to-plant. Our results showed that δ15Nplant, δ15Nsoil, and δ15Nsoil-to-plant were significantly different among the three zonal grassland types (analysis of differences with non-parametric Kruskal Test, P &lt; 0.05), with the lowest values in meadows and the highest values in deserts. Regression analyses showed that the δ15Nplant, δ15Nsoil, and δ15Nsoil-to-plant decreased with the increases of growing season precipitation (GSP) and habitat aridity index (Aridity), soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN), plant species richness, Shannon diversity index, and plant community productivity, whereas increased with the increases of accumulated active temperature (AccT) and soil total phosphorus (STP) across alpine grassland types at the regional scale. Multiple linear models with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) confirmed GSP to be the most critical driver, which alone explained most variances of δ15Nplant (56%), δ15Nsoil (62%), and δ15Nsoil-to-plant (35%). However, structural equation modeling performed better than multiple linear modeling in predicting δ15Nplant (76% vs. 66%) and worse in predicting δ15Nsoil (79% vs. 84%) and δ15Nsoil-to-plant (31% vs. 46%), likely due to the exclusion of collinear predictors and the removal of non-significant influencing paths. Overall, this study has highlighted the importance to uncover the complexity of climate, soil nutrients, and vegetation properties in networking to drive the different components of ecosystem N cycling in alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine vegetation; Climatic gradients; Ecosystem N cycling; Nitrogen isotopic composition; Plant functional traits; Tibetan Plateau","alpine environment; climate effect; covariance analysis; functional role; grassland soil; growing season; isotopic composition; nitrogen isotope; soil nutrient; soil-vegetation interaction; species diversity; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066103500

The jet flames of pulverized coal particles were produced by using an entrained-flow reactor with optical access, and the oxygen concentrations of the gas carrying pulverized coal particles were varied between 0 and 100%. A combination of laser-induced incandescence (LII), laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), elastic laser scattering (ELS), and radiative emission detection methods was employed to characterize the spatial distributions of soot, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), coal/char, and the flame temperature. The measured results revealed that ELS signal intensity declined accompanied with the appearance of LIF and LII signals. An evolution pattern of PAHs and soot was investigated to be similar to those found in gaseous hydrocarbon diffusion flames. An abrupt expansion of the pulverized coal particle jet was observed from ELS measurement at the position where coal particle jet was ignited, which was likely attributed to the more intensive dispersion of small particles caused by a rapid elevation of the flame temperature. As the oxygen concentration increased, the ignition distance of pulverized coal particle jet became shorter and the flame temperature increased. The PAHs and soot-loaded regions were shrunk and the sooting region shifted to upstream position of the flame. Nonetheless, replacing N2 with CO2 tended to increase the ignition distance but lower the flame temperature. The peak LII signal, corresponding to the maximum soot volume fraction, increased to a maximum and then decreased with oxygen concentration and the intensity for the O2/N2 case was far larger than for the O2/CO2 case. However, the LIF signal intensities exhibited an apparent decrease with increasing oxygen concentration, and they were nearly consistent when N2 was replaced with CO2, which may imply that the effect of suppressing radical formation on PAHs evolution in CO2 atmosphere was negligible. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Flame temperature; Optical diagnostics; PAHs; Pulverized coal; Soot","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Dust; Oxygen; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Pulverized fuel; Soot; Entrained Flow Reactor; Flame temperatures; Laser induced fluorescence; Optical diagnostics; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Pulverized coal combustion; Pulverized coal particle; Pulverized coals; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064243741

However, the large time-varying delay caused by inherent engine cycle and gas transport is a major challenge in the AFR performance control. Furthermore, AFR measurement via a universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensor often has a biased error and measurement noise that significantly affects states needed for the feedback control. Herein, an observer-based internal model controller (IMC) is proposed to accurately track the desired AFR values in the presence of system parameter uncertainty and large time-varying delay. This is accomplished by implementing a control law via approximating the system delay using Pade first-order technique, including a state observer plus an integrator for estimating the system state and even improving the steady-state error in state feedback. The stability of the overall closed-loop system is validated using robust Nyquist theorem. The results show that the proposed observer-based IMC design based on Pade first-order approximation has better performance than based on Pade second-order approximation and is easily implemented in real-time. Moreover, the control scheme can accurately control the AFR system under different operating conditions to demonstrate acceptable performance in terms of robustness and fast response. Besides, the comparisons to a PI combined with a Smith predictor is conducted to show its superiority. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air–fuel ratio (AFR); Lean-burn engines; Observer-based internal model control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110024483

To have a clearer understanding of the net GHG effect, we linked up the emission and absorption of the agricultural ecosystem, estimated the net emissions of 30 provinces in China from 2007 to 2016, then explored the spatial correlation from global and local perspectives by Moran's I, and finally tested the convergence of the net emissions by α convergence test, conditional β convergence test and spatial econometric methods. The results were: (1) The average of provincial agricultural net GHG emissions was around 4999.916 × 104 t, showing a fluctuating trend in the 10 years. Meanwhile, the gaps among provinces were gradually widening, as the provinces with high emissions were mainly agglomerated in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, while those with less emissions mainly sat in the northwest. (2) The net emissions correlated spatially in close provinces. The agglomeration centers were located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the northern coastal region, showing ""high-high"" and ""low-low"" agglomeration, respectively.

Herein, a strategy for designing PLICT-based emitters by the excited state quinone-conformation induced planarization is proposed. By virtue of RIR mechanism on TPP (tetraphenylpyrazinyl) unit, the newcomers named as TPP-PPI (1-phenyl-2-(4′-(3,5,6-triphenylpyrazin-2-yl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d] imidazole) and TPP-PI (1-phenyl-2-(4-(3,5,6-triphenylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)-1H-phenanthro[9,10-d]imidazole) exhibit aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics. TPP-PPI and TPP-PI have obvious PLICT properties via series of spectral measurements. Employing theoretical calculation in ground and excited states in different solvents, their PLICT process is confirmed further, and TPP's contribution on PLICT formation becomes clear. In non-doped organic light-emitting diodes, these two emitters with AIE and PLICT characteristic exhibit good performance with external quantum efficiency (4.85% and 4.36%) as blue emitters. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this work, calcium looping (CaL) is explored as a low-cost, pre-combustion CO2 capture scheme for modifying fuel gas produced by gasification and water-gas shifting. The efficiency reveals that average sorption capacities as high as 401 mg-CO2/g-CaO are achieved. Extremely high CO2 removal rates and high-purity H2 streams approaching 100% are achieved due to the uniquely high CO2 selectivity of the CaL-based CO2 capture technology. By using optimal sorption and desorption temperatures, the CaL technology also demonstrated an exceptionally high CO2 carrying capacity of 51%, and the stability of the sorbent through 20 CO2 sorption-desorption cycles in this work is 2 and 3 times better than the best and second best state-of-the-art CaO sorbents, respectively.

We show that lightweighting further accentuates these regional differences.

To obtain a high utilization efficiency of the pulverized coal, operating parameters are optimized frequently due to their operating flexibility. In this study, the effects of key operating parameters on coal utilization efficiency were evaluated based on computational fluid dynamics and grey relational analysis (CFD-GRA). The CFD simulation of pulverized coal combustion process was coupled with that of formation process of the major combustion zone (i.e., raceway). Then, the characteristics of coal utilization were analysed, two local indicators of coal utilization were proposed from the viewpoint of coal plume. The correlation degrees between the indicators and the operating parameters were obtained through employing GRA method, aiming to determine the primary operating parameter to coal utilization efficiency. Results of CFD-GRA evaluation indicate that the primary determinant of the raceway depth is the blast rate. Besides, the blast rate has stronger impacts on the overall burnout rate and intensive combustion zone in the coal plume. However, increasing the oxygen enrichment rate was observed to be more effective than the blast rate for improving medium particle utilization. Particle size distribution has the least impact on the local and overall coal utilization efficiency. Results yield an optimization strategy for operating parameters for achieving a high utilization efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coal plume; Coal utilization; Grey relational analysis; Parameter evaluation; Raceway shape","Blast furnaces; Coal; Computational fluid dynamics; Energy conservation; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Pulverized fuel; Two phase flow; Coal utilization; Grey relational analysis; Operating flexibility; Optimization strategy; Parameter evaluation; Pulverized coal combustion; Pulverized coal injection; Raceway shape; Coal combustion; carbon dioxide; coal combustion; computational fluid dynamics; efficiency measurement; numerical model; parameter estimation; simulation; size distribution; statistical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066263651

By retaining carbon, these soils delay its release into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. Forest disturbances may alter the ability of soil to recycle nutrients and decrease its potential to act as a carbon stock. In the Midwestern US, many forests are experiencing two simultaneous disturbances likely to permanently alter the soil ecosystem: invasion by the exotic shrub Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) and dense populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). To capture how these disturbances are impacting nutrient cycling, we measured potential soil enzyme activity and soil physicochemical properties in a fully factorial deer and honeysuckle removal experiment, where initial removal occurred three years prior to soil sampling. We measured β-glucosidase, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities, which are associated with carbon cycling, and phosphatase activity which is associated with phosphorus cycling. We also measured soil pH, moisture, and texture to determine if honeysuckle and/or deer are changing the habitat of microorganisms, which may indirectly alter enzyme release. Using structural equation modeling, we then compared direct and indirect effects between combinations of honeysuckle and deer presence/absence, soil characteristics, and enzyme activities. Honeysuckle presence increased soil moisture and pH, but these relationships were weak. Additionally, deer presence directly increased phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities and altered the environment to be more conducive for phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities by decreasing pH. Neither deer nor honeysuckle presence altered β-glucosidase or phosphatase activity. Since we could detect changes in soil enzyme activity when deer were excluded independently of honeysuckle, it is likely that soil microorganisms can recover from overabundant deer within shorter time periods and thus the effect of deer may be reversible. In a Midwestern US forest invaded by both Amur honeysuckle and overabundant deer, removing or reducing deer presence could reduce C emissions, but more research is needed to further elucidate how honeysuckle alters nutrient cycling. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Amur honeysuckle; Extracellular enzymes; Invasive species; Lonicera maackii; Odocoileus virginianus","Carbon; Enzyme activity; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Nutrients; Phenols; Phosphatases; Physicochemical properties; Soil moisture; Textures; Amur honeysuckle; Extracellular enzymes; Invasive species; Lonicera maackii; Odocoileus virginianus; Ecosystems; carbon cycle; deciduous forest; deer; disturbance; ecosystem function; enzyme; enzyme activity; forest ecosystem; forest soil; forestry production; invasive species; shrub; soil ecosystem; Carbon; Forestry; Greenhouse Gases; Microorganisms; Nutrients; Phenols; Midwest; United States; Cervidae; Lonicera; Lonicera maackii; Odocoileus virginianus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067001034

The result shows that Nepal has adhered to the 'vulnerability' and 'transition' discourses, which serve as important tools to advocate for fnancial support from the international climate change regime. Driven primarily by international processes and guidelines, the climate change policies and documents in Nepal project a heavily technocratic approach with litle socio-cultural considerations. Vulnerability is understood as a static property and assessed based on sectors and geographic areas, while adaptation is understood as series of actions to be implemented. Overall, the policies are at risk of perpetuating the existing systemic ills, as well as impeding imaginaries to pursue more radical socio-political and cultural change as efective adaptation measures. © 2019 Macalester College.

Over 50 countries have developed strategies for REDD+, implemented pilot activities and/or set up forest monitoring and reporting structures, safeguard systems and benefit sharing mechanisms (BSMs), offering lessons on how particular ideas guide policy design. The implementation of REDD+ at national, sub-national and local levels required payments to filter through multiple governance structures and priorities. REDD+ was variously interpreted by different actors in different contexts to create legitimacy for certain policy agendas. Using an adapted 3E (effectiveness, efficiency, equity and legitimacy) lens, we examine four common narratives underlying REDD+ BSMs: (1) that results-based payment (RBP) is an effective and transparent approach to reducing deforestation and forest degradation; (2) that emphasis on co-benefits risks diluting carbon outcomes; (3) that directing REDD+ benefits predominantly to poor smallholders, forest communities and marginalized groups helps address equity; and (4) that social equity and gender concerns can be addressed by well-designed safeguards. This paper presents a structured examination of eleven BSMs from within and beyond the forest sector and analyses the evidence to variably support and challenge these narratives and their underlying assumptions to provide lessons for REDD+ BSM design. Our findings suggest that contextualizing the design of BSMs, and a reflexive approach to examining the underlying narratives justifying particular design features, is critical for achieving effectiveness, equity and legitimacy. Key policy insights A results-based payment approach does not guarantee an effective REDD+; the contexts in which results are defined and agreed, along with conditions enabling social and political acceptance, are critical. A flexible and reflexive approach to designing a benefit-sharing mechanism that delivers emissions reductions at the same time as co-benefits can increase perceptions of equity and participation. Targeting REDD+ to smallholder communities is not by default equitable, if wider rights and responsibilities are not taken into account Safeguards cannot protect communities or society without addressing underlying power and gendered relations. The narratives and their underlying generic assumptions, if not critically examined, can lead to repeated failure of REDD+ policies and practices. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Cities and urban areas are at the core of anthropogenic climate emissions. So far, however, cities are not generally recognized as major action fields for a climate neutral society. Yet, individual examples of cities with a strong climate neutral agenda prove the overall societal and economic advantage of their actions. This study analyses 15 European cities to understand the influence and potentials, local actions and political activities as well as targets that cities can take and define to mitigate climate change and contribute to the global 2-degree goal. The empirical evaluation of the cities was conducted in 2017, using the science-based targets approach on public buildings as initial pilot. The study identifies critical internal and external success factors for effective climate engagements, particularly from the 1/3 of the cities whose strategies comply with the 2-degrees target. Criteria and levers are derived that help cities transform into low carbon communities. From that, a framework model and operational guidance are developed, binging cities in the position to develop their individual path towards the 2-degree goal. The results of the study are demonstrated by the case of the Swedish community of Vaxjö, showcasing how the early and broad adoption of low carbon policies and actions results in overall economic growth and prosperity as a 'green community'. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Next to their unquestionable benefits, due to the character of the provided activity, they can be a potential source of odours. Municipal waste, largely containing biodegradable fractions, is often subject to decomposition processes in uncontrolled conditions still before it is supplied to the mechanical biological treatment plant. One of the effects of the processes, both controlled and uncontrolled conditions, is emission of odorants. Their spread depends on the applied technologies and adherence to the technological regime during operation. One of the factors determining the types and concentrations of emitted odorants are also meteorological conditions in which waste is stored and processed. The paper presents results of two series of pilot research conducted at four plants, involving a preliminary analysis of the effect of meteorological conditions on the emission of odorants at biogas plants processing municipal waste. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Biogas; Environmental engineering; Odors; Alternative energy source; Biodegradable fraction; Decomposition process; Mechanical-biological treatment; Meteorological condition; Potential sources; Preliminary analysis; Technological regime; Waste treatment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072802512

In some instances, when the object is greatly extended or the spectral dispersion is too small, there may be locations in the focal plane where emission lines at different wavelengths contribute. It is then desirable to unfold the overlapped regions in order to isolate the contributions from the individual wavelengths. In this paper, we describe a method for such an unfolding, using an inversion technique developed for an extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrometer and coronagraph named the COronal Spectroscopic Imager in the EUV (COSIE). The COSIE spectrometer wavelength range (18.6-20.5 nm) contains a number of strong coronal emission lines and several density sensitive lines. We focus on optimizing the unfolding process to retrieve emission measure maps at constant temperature, maps of spectrally pure intensity in the Fe xii and Fe xiii lines, and density maps based on both Fe xii and Fe xiii diagnostics. © 2019.

However, stormwater reuse is constrained due to the presence of many toxic pollutants such as hydrocarbons. Effective mitigation requires robust mathematical models for stormwater quality prediction based on an understanding of pollutant processes. However, the rise in global temperatures will impose changes to pollutant processes. This study has proposed a new perspective on modelling the build-up process of hydrocarbons, with a focus on volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Among organic compounds, VOCs are the most susceptible to changes as a result of global warming due to their volatility. Seven VOCs, namely, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, para-xylene, meta-xylene, ortho-xylene and styrene in road dust were investigated. The outcomes are expected to lay the foundation to overcoming the limitations in current modelling approaches such as not considering the influence of temperature and volatility, on the build-up process. A new conceptualisation is proposed for the classical build-up model by mathematically defining the volatility of VOCs in terms of temperature. Uncertainty in the re-conceptualised build-up model was quantified and was used to understand the build-up patterns in the future scenarios of global warming. Results indicated that for the likely scenarios, the variability in VOCs build-up gradually increases at the beginning of the dry period and then rapidly increases after around seven days, while the build-up reaches a near-constant value in a shorter dry period, limiting the variability. These initial research outcomes need to be further investigated given the expected impacts of global warming into the future. Build-up of volatile organic components was investigated by taking temperature and volatility into account. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Global warming; Hydrocarbons; Stormwater pollutant processes; Stormwater quality; Stormwater reuse; Volatility","Drought; Global warming; Hydrocarbons; Pollution; Storm sewers; Styrene; Volatile organic compounds; Xylene; Global temperatures; Pollutant process; Research outcome; Stormwater pollutants; Stormwater quality; Stormwaters; Volatile organic components; Volatility; Storms; benzene; ethylbenzene; hydrocarbon; meta xylene; ortho xylene; para xylene; storm water; styrene; toluene; volatile organic compound; hydrocarbon; rain; global warming; hydrocarbon; pollutant; road; stormwater; urban area; volatile organic compound; volatilization; water pollution; water quality; Article; controlled study; dust; greenhouse effect; quantitative analysis; temperature; urban area; volatilization; waste water recycling; water quality; chemistry; environmental monitoring; procedures; theoretical model; uncertainty; urbanization; volatilization; water pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Global Warming; Hydrocarbons; Models, Theoretical; Rain; Temperature; Uncertainty; Urbanization; Volatilization; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067678881

Despite ongoing discussion of adopting interventions for improving adaptation and adaptive capacity to climate change, practitioners often continue to carry out conventional management strategies that do not effectively incorporate climate change impacts and projections. Using a web-based survey and semi-structured interviews, we explored the perceptions of practitioners (coastal managers and planners) in British Columbia, Canada relative to climate change risks, adaptation actions for social and ecological systems, and barriers for adaptation within the region. Overall, practitioners shared a concern that climate change is not currently well incorporated in management or policy in this region, and noted significant implementation gaps. Practitioners expressed more support for ecological adaptation actions that are well suited to regional implementation, such as incorporating climate change projections into management and reducing fisheries overexploitation, than for actions such as protecting specific areas. Social adaptation actions were overall perceived as less useful than ecological adaptation actions, and actions that would support local management and monitoring efforts were viewed as more useful than developing alternative livelihoods. The main barriers and associated opportunities for climate change adaptation in marine management included political action, reducing scientific uncertainty, improving communication, and increasing capacity (both funding and staff). Additional opportunities include effective engagement with Indigenous governance, improving policies and funding for adaptation including monitoring, and focusing efforts on communication and education programs specific to practitioners and communities. This study demonstrates the necessity of collaboration across scales of management for effective climate change adaptation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity conservation; Climate change adaptation; Coastal management; Expert survey; Marine protected areas; Perceptions; Social-ecological systems","Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecology; Environmental protection; Human resource management; Marine communication; Risk perception; Sensory perception; Surveys; Biodiversity conservation; Climate change adaptation; Coastal management; Expert survey; Marine protected area; Social-ecological systems; Climate change; adaptive management; biodiversity; climate change; coastal zone management; conservation management; environmental management; environmental policy; marine park; perception; policy implementation; questionnaire survey; strategic approach; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066779378

These cannot possibly be financed from fiscal sources and ODA flows alone; private financing will need to be accessed. Focusing on the ability of city governments and subnational urban utilities to mobilize private finance, this paper makes two core arguments. First, private investment in municipal infrastructure requires robust institutional, fiscal and regulatory systems that are often absent in developing countries. Establishing such systems often requires policy and institutional reform, much of which lies beyond the competence and control of city governments themselves. Second, while the marginal investment needs related to climate mitigation and adaptation complicate and aggravate the picture, they do not alter the fundamental requirements of private investors. Put simply, municipalities and utilities will need to satisfy the requirements of regular private finance before they can attract green private finance. This paper looks across the main avenues for city governments to mobilize private finance–municipal borrowing, public–private partnerships, and land value capture instruments–and identifies four broad factors that determine the potential size and scope of city leveraging activity. It then offers a new framework to understand where the most pressing constraints to private investment readiness lie and proposes priority measures that local and national governments, together with development partners and other stakeholders, can take to address them. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; land value capture; municipal borrowing; Municipal finance; private investment; public–private partnerships; urban infrastructure","climate change; developing world; financial provision; financial services; infrastructure; investment; private sector; public-private partnership",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060811242

The metropolitan economic boom that followed swiftly on the end of the First World War led to an extraordinary growth of population and industry in the capital, especially in the 1930s. By the end of that decade one in five of the people of England and Wales was a Londoner, living somewhere within the boundaries of Greater London, as defined by the Metropolitan Police District. For many public policy-makers, this growth was not just draining the rest of the nation of its talent; it was directly causing disinvestment in the Distressed Areas of Northern England, Wales and Scotland. It was Neville Chamberlain, long a critic of London’s overgrowth and a convinced advocate of satellite towns and garden cities, who laid the national policy basis for at last solving the London problem with the Barlow Commission on the Distribution of the Industrial Population, reporting in 1940. In alliance with the town and country planning movement, with the nation’s most famous planner-architect Patrick Abercrombie, and with a consensus of opinion that was especially strong on the centre-left of national and London politics, a planning framework was established for the post-war capital in two ambitious plans for the County of London and for the Greater London area. The war, with its assertion of a new national unity embracing the notion of planning in all walks of life but especially in the reconstruction of the bombed cities, produced a receptive climate to planning interventions in the future of London. But there were unintended consequences. It is arguable that the London Plans of 1943–44, and the Government planning policy of 1946 that followed their lead, would help produce nearly forty years of metropolitan decline that only began to end in the second half of the 1980s. © 2019, © The London Journal Trust 2019.","Blitz; Distribution of population and industry; Home front; Lewis Silkin; London; Neville Chamberlain; Patrick Abercrombie; Second World War; Town and country planning","industrial development; planning history; population distribution; population growth; town planning; war; England; London [England]; Scotland; United Kingdom; Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074843123

Alarming rates of forest loss in the Amazon region gained international attention in the past, but deforestation declined substantially since 2004 (although the rate has trended upwards since 2012). This result conforms to the GHG emission reduction targets set by the National Climate Change Plan, originally divided into three phases: 2006–2009; 2010–2013; and 2014–2017. According to the plan, emission reductions are measured against a deforestation baseline, initially corresponding to the average forest loss observed from 1996 to 2005 (reference period). We used an artificial neural network (ANN) model to spatialize the plan's original three-phase baseline and compare (i) the simulated carbon emissions from the baseline scenario to (ii) the emissions from observed deforestation during 2006–2017. Baseline spatialization was performed at the state level and informed by the 2000–2004 deforestation patterns in each state, resulting in nine state-specific calibrated ANNs. Simulated (baseline) and observed deforestation were compared to five biomass-density maps in order to estimate Brazil's GHG emission reductions. Our results indicate that forest loss during the study period was 62,321 km2 lower than the baseline and associated with 1.5 ± 0.4 Pg of avoided CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Virtually all emission reductions (93%) occurred in the states of Mato Grosso (74%) and Rondônia (19%). In contrast, Roraima, Amazonas, and Amapá states increased GHG emissions by 44.8, 36.7, and 14.7 Tg CO2, respectively. Lastly, we discuss the issue of attribution of deforestation reductions for results-based payments (REDD+) and the emission reduction certificates issued by the Amazon Fund. © Copyright © 2019 West, Börner and Fearnside.","artificial neural network; carbon offset; greenhouse gas emission; land-use/cover change; REDD+",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080058655

Results showed that the OP families from the southerly BZ4300 breeding zone averaged higher survival and significantly greater mean tree height growth than the local OP families in the more northern BZ3300 breeding zone at tree age of 14 years, with no notable difference in frost damage. Estimates of type-B genetic correlation from pairwise tests or combined-test analyses were almost all greater than 0.7, suggesting weak G × E interactions. Greater variation among families and higher heritability estimates in tree height were observed for families from the BZ3300 breeding zone or when families from the two breeding zones were combined. The weak G × E interactions, in addition to better survival and growth of the southerly families in the more northern breeding zone, suggested benefits from deploying seed from current seed orchard in the BZ4300 breeding zone to the BZ3300 breeding zone and merging the two breeding zones when starting the second generation breeding to increase tree improvement efficiency and likely higher genetic gain under future climate. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Genotype × environment interaction; Picea glauca; Progeny test; Tree improvement; Type-B genetic correlation","Efficiency; Forestry; Breeding populations; Climate change adaptation; Genetic correlation; Heritability estimates; Picea glauca; Progeny tests; Tree improvement; Tree Improvement Program; Climate change; adaptation; breeding; climate change; coniferous forest; genetic analysis; genotype-environment interaction; growth; testing method; Breeding; Canada; Efficiency; Forestry; Growth; Ontario; Picea Glauca; Tree Dimensions; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Picea glauca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056868724

Coastal China is a typical region of rapid urban expansion, and obvious spatial heterogeneity exists from the north to south. However, the different urban change characteristics and the effect on carbon balance remain undetermined. By unifying the spatial-temporal resolution of carbon source and sink data, we effectively compared the carbon budgets of three coastal urban agglomerations in China. The results show that all of the three urban agglomerations have undergone an obvious urban expansion process, with the built-up area increasing from 1.03 × 104 km2 in 2000 to 3.06 × 104 km2 in 2013. For Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the built-up area gradually expanded. The built-up area in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) gradually changed before 2007 but rapidly grew thereafter. The built-up expansion of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) passed through three growing stages and showed the largest mean patch size. Carbon emission spatial patterns in the three urban agglomerations are consistent with their economic development, from which the net ecosystem production (NEP) spatial patterns are very different. Compared to carbon emissions, NEP has a carbon sink effect and can absorb some carbon emissions, but the amounts were all much lower than the carbon emissions in the three urban agglomerations. The carbon sink effect in the Yangtze River Delta is the most obvious, with the Pearl River Delta following, and the lowest effect is in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. Finally, a scientific basis for policy-making is provided for viable CO2 emission mitigation policies. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emission; Carbon sink; Spatial; Urban agglomeration; Urban expansion","agglomeration; carbon emission; carbon sink; heterogeneity; mitigation; pollution policy; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Hebei; Tianjin; Yangtze River; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071985214

We present a framework for integrating and preserving detailed bottom-up information for end-of-pipe abatement technologies into a large-scale numerical model. Using an activity analysis approach, we capture non-linearities that typically characterise bottom-up abatement cost curves derived from discrete technology options. The model framework is flexible and can accommodate greenhouse gas and air pollution abatement, as well as modelling carbon capture and storage (CCS). Here, we illustrate this approach for non-CO2 greenhouse gases in a large-scale Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model and compare results with a fitted marginal abatement curve and with completely excluding non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Results show that excluding non-CO2 abatement options leads to an overestimation of the total abatement cost. When the detailed bottom-up technology implementation is replaced by a fitted smooth marginal abatement cost curve, significant over- or underestimations of abatement levels and costs can emerge for particular pollutant-sector-region combinations. © 2019 The Authors","CGE model; Climate policy; End-of-pipe abatement; Hybrid modelling; Marginal abatement costs; Non-CO2 greenhouse gases","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Economics; Environmental protection; Greenhouse gases; Pollution; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); CGE model; Climate policy; Computable general equilibrium model; Hybrid modelling; Marginal abatement cost curves; Marginal abatement costs; Technology implementation; Cost benefit analysis; abatement cost; atmospheric pollution; bottom-up approach; carbon sequestration; computable general equilibrium analysis; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; global economy; greenhouse gas; numerical model; policy analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069812055

This model distinguished five maturity levels: the initial level, growth level, standard level, integration level, and optimization level. Based on the empirical study about urban residents in 10 eastern provinces (cities)of China, this study found that the carbon capability maturity of the urban residents exhibited an obvious “pyramidal” distribution, which ranged from the initial level to the optimization level. About 71.7% of the residents were at the initial level, but the proportions of those at the standard level, integration level, and optimization level were less than 10%. Shanghai, Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan were at the growth level, whereas the urban residents in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong were at the initial level. The main reason for this gap was the difference in the carbon identification capability.

However, aquifer protection can be an expensive proposition because water uses that currently rely on aquifer pumping may produce considerable economic value that would be lost if protection measures are carried out. Evidence from climate-stressed regions has attracted research addressing the costs and benefits of aquifer protection plans. Despite these efforts, few peer-reviewed papers have examined water use patterns that minimize the economic costs of aquifer protection. This work presents an original approach to address that gap by developing and applying a basin scale hydroeconomic optimization model of North America's Middle Rio Grande Basin to explore impacts of new policies not yet implemented supporting aquifer protection. It also gives model access to readers or stakeholders to experiment with their own scenarios to assess impacts of alternative aquifer protection plans. The model accounts for surface and groundwater storage, irrigation, urban, environmental, and recreational demands, surface water inflows under various climate scenarios, groundwater pumping and recharge, substitute water prices, crop water use, evaporation, as well as institutional constraints governing water use. The objective is implemented by finding the optimized discounted net present value of economic benefits summed over uses, sectors, and regions from use of surface water and connected aquifers. Results are shown for each of six water supply scenarios, two substitute water prices, and two system operation rules. To address impacts of aquifer protection targets, groundwater sustainability targets are specified and enforced as constraints for each of the region's two major aquifers. We assess total and marginal cost of achieving two targeted aquifer protection levels by identifying optimized surface use and groundwater pumping for each of 24 scenarios. Results show that climate change, in the form of reduced and highly variable inflows, considerably drives up the cost of protecting aquifer sustainability, amplified by the conjunctive nature of the system. Future work points to a need to assess economic performance of various water conservation measures as well as reducing costs of substitute water through measures such as technical advance in desalination, recycling and reuse, substitution of other resources for water, better characterization of existing aquifers, and development of new groundwater supplies. © 2019","Aquifer protection; Climate stress adaptation; Hydroeconomic optimization model; Optimal growth; Water management","Aquifers; Climate change; Climate models; Cost reduction; Desalination; Economic analysis; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Optimization; Pumps; Surface waters; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water management; Water recycling; Water supply; Aquifer protection; Climate stress adaptation; Conservation measures; Economic performance; Groundwater pumping; Hydro-economic optimizations; Institutional constraints; Optimal growth; Recharging (underground waters); adaptive management; aquifer characterization; climate change; groundwater abstraction; growth rate; hydrological modeling; inflow; optimization; water availability; water economics; water management; water stress; water use efficiency; Brazil; Rio Grande Basin [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068254673

The present study was conducted to assess the relation of biophysical parameters with forest biomass carbon in north Kashmir region of Himalayas. The relation of biomass carbon was assessed with (1) species type or strata including Cedrus deodara, mixed I (Cedrus deodara-Pinus wallichiana), mixed II (Abies pindrow-Picea smithiana) and Pinus wallichiana, (2) altitude (1292–2911 m amsl), (3) crown density, (4) aspect, (5) tree count or density and (6) location. Using a stratified sampling design, a total of 188 quadrats of 0.1 ha were laid across the entire region representing different biophysical parameters. Field observation including diameter at breast height and height were recorded and sample biomass (t ha−1) was estimated using volumetric equations. The observed relation of aboveground biomass carbon with species revealed a trend of mixed II ˃ Cedrus deodara ˃ mixed I ˃ Pinus wallichiana. A positive but weak correlation (R2 = 0.02) was found between aboveground biomass carbon and altitude. A reasonably good correlation (R2 = 0.40) was observed to exist between aboveground biomass carbon and crown density. The highest value of average biomass carbon (72.63 t ha−1) was recorded for the north-eastern aspect whereas the lowest value (44.60 t ha−1) was recorded for the eastern aspect. The aboveground biomass carbon and tree count was found positively correlated (+ 0.475, R2 = 0.48). Forest biomass carbon fluctuates within the same geographical region with a variety of biophysical factors. The growth rate of species, photosynthetic ability under different crown densities and climatic conditions could address the reasons for this variability. Biophysical relations of forest biomass carbon can be viewed as an important input for guidelines and policy matters on climate change. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biomass carbon; Biophysical parameters; Forest; Himalaya","Biophysics; Carbon; Climate change; Forestry; Growth rate; Above ground biomass; Biophysical parameters; Diameter-at-breast heights; Forest; Himalayas; Mitigation projects; Stratified sampling design; Volumetric equation; Biomass; carbon; carbon; aboveground biomass; altitude; biophysics; canopy architecture; carbon; forest; population density; Abies; Abies pindrow; altitude; Article; biomass distribution; biophysics; Cedrus; Cedrus deodara; climate change; correlational study; forest; geographic distribution; nonhuman; photosynthesis; Picea smithiana; pine; Pinus wallichiana; plant growth; spruce; tree crown; biomass; environmental monitoring; forest; growth, development and aging; India; Pakistan; procedures; tree; Himalayas; India; Jammu and Kashmir; Abies pindrow; Cedrus deodara; Picea smithiana; Pinus wallichiana; Altitude; Biomass; Carbon; Cedrus; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; India; Pakistan; Pinus; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070201429

Besides, the SDA method was used to reveal the drivers of changes in CO2 emissions. The study uses data from the 2007 and 2012 multi-regional input-output tables. The result shows that domestic demand emissions are the primary source of production-based emissions in China, but the proportion of external demand emissions is increasing rapidly. According to the structural decomposition of the embodied carbon emissions, it can be seen that the carbon emissions caused by the trade in intermediate products have always been a major component of external demand emissions. Further research indicates that the rapid growth in carbon emissions from the production and consumption side of the region is mainly attributed to the expansion of the final demand scale and changes in input structure of the production department. The most critical factor that restrains the increase in carbon emissions on both principles in all regions is the reduction of emission intensity in the production sector.

Both high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and functional gene microarray technology were used to detect the responses of microbial phylogenetic and functional compositions to N amendment and elevated temperature. Our results indicated that sodium nitrate and ammonium sulfate divergently shaped the microbial community composition at ambient temperature. Sodium nitrate decreased the abundance of genes involved in N cycling and carbon (C) decomposition, while ammonium sulfate had no significant effect. However, these distinct effects could be overrode by elevated temperature, where it was observed that both N amendment increased the abundance of N cycling and C decomposition genes. This indicates that future warming may “mask” the effects of amendment of different forms of N in alpine grassland. It may give a new perspective for N amendment in future warming scenario. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Elevated temperature; Global warming; Nitrate and ammonium amendment; Soil microbiome; Tibetan grassland","Ecosystems; Global warming; Microorganisms; Nitrates; RNA; Sodium nitrate; Soils; Sulfur compounds; 16S rRNA gene sequencing; Agricultural ecosystems; Elevated temperature; Functional compositions; Microbial communities; Microbial community composition; Microbiome; Tibetans; Genes; ammonium sulfate; community composition; decomposition; grassland soil; high temperature; nitrate; soil amendment; soil nitrogen; temperature effect; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068959010

Based on research adding Bacillus stearothermophilus can reduce ammonia emissions during composting because it can use sugar in organic matter fermentation to produce organic acids over 50 °C. This study conducted the batch experiments by adding different concentrations of Bacillus stearothermophilus to reduce the ammonia emissions and find out its characteristic during layer manure composting by using an aerobic composting reactor with sawdust as a bulking agent. The results show that the application of Bacillus stearothermophilus can accelerate the rate of temperature and significantly decrease pH, the warming period was 2 days in the treatment with Bacillus stearothermophilus, while it was 4 days in the treatment without Bacillus stearothermophilus. Ammonia emissions were mainly occurred in warming and high temperature period during composting. The ammonia emissions in the treatment with 8.00 g/kg initial Bacillus stearothermophilus were significantly lower than the other lower Bacillus stearothermophilus treatment and control during composting (p < 0.05), and it can significantly increase ammonium-nitrogen and nitrate-nitrogen concentration, reduce pH (p < 0.05), but the average number of Bacillus stearothermophilus copies in treatment with different initial Bacillus stearothermophilus concentration had no significant difference (p > 0.05). MiSeq System Sequencing results find that the addition of Bacillus stearothermophilus changed the bacterial community structure under warming and high-temperature periods during composting, increased the relative abundance of lactic acid bacillus and nitrification bacteria. Therefore, the reason for the low ammonia emission in 8.00 g/kg initial Bacillus stearothermophilus treatments might be not only due to the Bacillus stearothermophilus itself, but also Bacillus stearothermophilus can change the indigenous microorganism community, including increase the relative content of lactic acid Bacillus and nitrification bacteria, thus reducing the pH and promoting nitrification, and reducing ammonia emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ammonia; Bacillus stearothermophilus; Composting; Indigenous microorganism; Layer manure","ammonia; ammonium nitrate; nitrogen; ammonia; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; ammonia; community structure; composting; concentration (composition); fermentation; manure; microorganism; nitrogen; organic acid; ammonia formation; Article; Bacillus; carbon footprint; community structure; composting; concentration (parameter); controlled study; Geobacillus stearothermophilus; high temperature; lactic acid bacterium; manure; microbial community; nitrification; nonhuman; pH; sawdust; animal; chemistry; composting; fermentation; Geobacillus stearothermophilus; growth, development and aging; manure; microbiology; procedures; soil; temperature; Bacillus (bacterium); Bacteria (microorganisms); Geobacillus stearothermophilus; Ammonia; Animals; Composting; Fermentation; Geobacillus stearothermophilus; Manure; Nitrates; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065177960

This paper focusses on freight distribution, introduces a transportation resource sharing strategy to address the multi-depot green vehicle routing problem, and incorporates the time-dependency of speed as well as piecewise penalty costs for earliness and tardiness of deliveries. Transportation resource sharing is proposed to eliminate long and empty-vehicle trips, improve the network's fluidity and the efficiency of resource management. A bi-objective model is proposed to minimize total carbon emission and operating cost, while enforcing piecewise penalty costs on earliness and tardiness to reduce waiting time and improve customer satisfaction. Further, we combine the Clarke and Wright Savings Heuristic Algorithm (CWSHA), the Sweep Algorithm (SwA) and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (MOPSO) to design a hybrid heuristic algorithm for the vehicle routing optimization. CWSHA and SwA are consecutively used to generate the initial population, and MOPSO is employed for local and global solution search. Computational experiments reveal that sharing transportation resource reduces the total travelled distance, the number of vehicles, and facilitates a cost effective and environment-friendly distribution network. In addition, we also observe that the shortest path sometimes undermines minimum cost and carbon emission objectives. Moreover, sensitivity analyses reveal that vehicle routes are less influenced by piecewise penalty costs under unimodal traffic flows, while bimodal traffic flows would require more investment to reduce carbon emission. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Green vehicle routing; Hybrid heuristic; Piecewise penalty cost; Resource sharing; Time-dependent vehicle speed","Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Customer satisfaction; Environmental impact; Global warming; Heuristic algorithms; Hybrid vehicles; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sensitivity analysis; Vehicle routing; Clarke and wright savings heuristic; Hybrid heuristic algorithms; Hybrid heuristics; Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms; Piecewise penalties; Resource sharing; Vehicle routing optimization; Vehicle speed; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067621683

With the prevalence of mobile sensors, there is an emerging way to monitor the air quality with mobile sensors on vehicles. Compared with traditional expensive monitor stations, mobile sensors are cheaper and more abundant, but observations from these sensors have unstable spatial and temporal distributions, which results in the existing model could not work very well on this type of data. In this article, taking advantage of air quality data from mobile sensors, we propose an real-time urban air quality estimation method based on the Gaussian Process Regression for air pollution of the unmonitored areas, pivoting on the diffusion effect and the accumulation effect of air pollution. In order to meet the real-time demands, we propose a two-layer ensemble learning framework and a self-adaptivity mechanism to improve computational efciency and adaptivity.

Previous studies have focused more on individual sectors when investigating the spatial impact of urbanization on CO2, but few have compared the differences among sectors. This study uses geographically weighted regression model to investigate the effect of urbanization on CO2 emissions in six sectors in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Industrial structure and energy intensity were selected as control variables in this study. The results indicate that the impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery and water conservancy sector declines from the southeastern coastal area to the northwest. The influence of urbanization on CO2 emissions presents an increasing trend from the northeast region to the southwest region in the construction industry sector. In industry and residential consumption sectors, urbanization had a greater impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region than in the western region. However, urbanization had a stronger impact on CO2 emissions in the western region than in the eastern region in the transportation, storage, and postal industry sector. As for wholesale and retail trade and catering and accommodation industry sector, the effect of urbanization on CO2 emissions in the southern region was larger than in the northern region. To achieve the goal of ultimately reducing carbon emissions, policymakers should formulate differential policy for different sectors in different regions, optimize the industrial structure, and develop high technology. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","China; GWR model; Multi-sectoral CO2 emissions; Spatial effect; Urbanization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070785405

In China, a country dominated by coal-fired power generation, the problem is more serious. Regulators must use capacity control of coal-fired power generation as a key policy tool for emission reduction. This paper was concerned about the environmental effect of changes in thermal power capacity utilization on pollutants emissions in China. Under the econometric strategy of panel smoothing transformation regression (PSTR) model, the switching regimes and paths of seven pollutants emissions to thermal power capacity utilization were evaluated with the transition variables of power generation and electricity consumption, respectively. The three statistics, LM test, LMF and pseudo-LRT, unanimously verify the necessity of nonlinearity. In addition to CO2 emissions whose transition function presents U-shaped feature both in the models with power generation and electricity consumption as transition variable, the other pollutants such as SO2, NOX and so on generally exhibit quasi S-shaped change trend. The interaction term of installed capacity and average annual operating hours of thermal power plants introduced to reflect the interactive environmental effect of thermal power capacity utilization on pollutants emissions, appear similarity in most pollutants. However, the negative coefficients of the transition functions for interactive environmental effect imply that the policymakers reduce pollution by defusing capacity, which needs to be supplemented by setting reasonable warning line for operating hours of thermal power. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Pollutant emissions; Power generating capacity; PSTR model; Utilization","Electric power generation; Electric power utilization; Emission control; Thermoelectric power plants; Waste utilization; Coal-fired power generation; Electricity-consumption; Negative coefficients; Pollutant emission; Power generating capacity; Smoothing transformation; Thermal power generation; Thermal power plants; Thermal pollution; coal-fired power plant; econometrics; emission control; emission inventory; environmental economics; panel data; pollution incidence; power generation; regulatory approach; thermal power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066874065

Data of Hg concentration in surface soil are fundamental to understanding environmental Hg cycling. However, present knowledge on the quantity and global distribution of Hg in soil remains deficient. Using stable Hg isotopic analyses and geospatial data, the concentration and global spatial distribution of Hg in surface soil of 0-20 cm depth have been developed. It is estimated that 1088 ± 379 Gg of Hg is stored in surface soil globally. Thirty-two percent of the surface Hg storage resides in tropical/subtropical forest regions, 23% in temperate/boreal forest regions, 28% in grassland and steppe and shrubland, 7% in tundra, and 10% in desert and xeric shrubland. Evidence from Hg isotopic signatures points to atmospheric Hg0 dry deposition through vegetation uptake as the primary source of Hg in surface soil. Given the influence of changing climate on vegetative development, global climate change can act as an important forcing factor for shaping spatial distribution of Hg in surface soil. This active forcing cycle significantly dilutes the impacts caused by Hg release from anthropogenic sources, and needs to be considered in assessing the effectiveness of reducing Hg use and emissions as specified in Minamata Convention on Mercury.

Multiscale variability of precipitation and their teleconnection with large-scale climate anomalies: A case study of Xi'an city, China. In: Guido-Aldana, P.A. and Mulahasan, S. (eds.), Advances in Water Resources and Exploration. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 93, pp. 417-426. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The changes of precipitation affect the urban rainstorm waterlogging and water resources management, which have important influences on the sustainable development of society. The primary objective of the paper is to provide theoretical basis for local water resources management and disaster prevention and reduction by analyzing the multiscale variability of precipitation and their teleconnection with large-scale climate anomalies in Xi'an city of China. The change characteristics of precipitation and extreme precipitation indices were investigated using Mann-Kendall test, Spearman's rank correlation and wavelet analysis. The cross wavelet transform and wavelet coherence were used to explore the correlations between the precipitation and large-scale teleconnection indices such as Arctic Oscillation (AO), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and sunspot. Results indicate that: the precipitation was mainly concentrated in summer, followed by autumn. The annual, seasonal and monthly precipitation except June and August had decreasing trends, and the magnitudes of precipitation decrease were more pronounced in spring, April and November. The change patterns varied for extreme precipitation indices. The temporal variation in extreme precipitation indices indicated that the extreme precipitation events had mainly increased during 1971-1990 and 1991-2017, and decreased during 1951-1970 and 1951-2017, especially, increased more pronounced during 1991-2017 and decreased more pronounced during 1951-1970. The precipitation exhibited a fluctuant change from increase to decrease, then increase to decrease and finally increase trends, and there was an abrupt change point in 1965. The annual precipitation had statistically significant cycles of 3-5 year and 7-10 year at 5% significance level. The large-scale teleconnection indices affected the precipitation in Xi'an city. The phase differences between precipitation and teleconnection indices including AO and SOI were in-phase dominated, and anti-phase dominated between precipitation and teleconnection indices including ENSO and sunspot, indicating that the AO and SOI exerted positive climate impacts on the precipitation and vice-versa for ENSO and sunspot. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.","Precipitation; teleconnection; variability; wavelet analyses; Xi'an",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072671649

The merocyanine L-Mero4 and phenyl-substituted P-L-Mero4 have a S-trans and S-cis structure, respectively, consisting of indole moiety as the donor, indandione as the acceptor, and the tetramethine as the bridge. The time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) picosecond measurements after excitation at wavelength 515 nm to the ππ* state yield emission curves with a short component τ1 in the range of 27–160 ps and a second component τ2 of 200–780 ps for L-Mero4. In P-L-Mero4, τ1 lies in the range of 18–150 ps and τ2 220–520 ps. The subfemtosecond transient absorption measurements yield a short component around 0.4–1.4 ps, and the second/third components are similar to those in the TCPSC measurements. The analysis of the experimental data demonstrates that the ground state recovery exhibits a biexponential rise and rapidly indicates that the conversion back to the electronic ground state provides a fast, nonradiative pathway. Quantum chemical calculations on the electronic structures and their dependence on the molecular confirmation are performed. We identify the excited states and the relaxation path along the twist of the center double bonds in tetramethine that might be the nonradiative pathway. The C=C double bond is weakened in the ππ* state. The phenyl substitution in the conjugated double bond weakens this C=C bond, lowers the isomerization barrier, increases the nonradiative rate, and reduces the emission quantum yield. In polar solvents, the energy of the perpendicular conformer along the trans–cis isomerization path is increased to achieve less coupling to the ground state surface. Because of the small barrier to the trans form, these two conformers establish an equilibrium condition. The trans form, which lies at a lower energy, gains more population and thus has a higher emission yield. © 2019 The Chemical Society Located in Taipei & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Wind power has made contributions to emission reduction, but it is undeniable that the substantial wind farms (SWFs) have had a non-negligible impact on the local ABL. This paper aims to provide a reliable methodological scheme and practical data for human beings to objectively understand the development of wind power. Based on the data from one of the Chinese gigawatt-scale wind power bases in Zhangbei County of Hebei Province, the mesoscale simulations were conducted to explore the impacts of substantial wind farms on the local and regional atmosphere. The results show that: (i) the impact of substantial wind farms on the local area is significant and sustained, while this impact on the regional area is slight and occasional; (ii) it can bring about the seasonal and diurnal differences in the local ABL property; (iii) it can not only induce the horizontal turbulence directly caused by wind turbine wake flow, but also produce the vertical mixing in the near-surface ABL. A systematic analysis of wind power potential and its atmospheric impact is urgent to ensure sustainable development of wind power. © 2019","Atmospheric boundary layer; Mesoscale simulation; Seasonal and diurnal impacts; Substantial wind farm","Atmospheric boundary layer; Electric utilities; Emission control; Sustainable development; Wind power; Atmospheric impact; Emission reduction; Environment friendly; Mesoscale simulation; Seasonal and diurnal impacts; Systematic analysis; Wind farm; Wind turbine wakes; Electric power system interconnection; boundary layer; diurnal variation; mesoscale motion; seasonal variation; simulation; turbulence; wake; wind farm; wind power; China; Hebei; Zhangbei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068573988

The question of how to reduce emissions while maintaining stable economic growth is a serious challenge for the country. To achieve this, it is of great significance to track the spatial and temporal evolution of carbon emissions in China during recent decades, which can provide evidence-based scientific guidance for developing mitigation policies. In this study, we calculated the carbon emissions of land use in 1999-2015 using the carbon emissions factor method proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Kuznets curve model was used to explore the influence of economic growth and urbanization on carbon emissions at the national and provincial levels. The results indicated that (1) China's emissions increased from 927.88 million tons (Mt) in 1999 to 2833.91 Mt in 2015 at an average annual growth rate of 12.94%, while carbon sinks grew slightly, from 187.58 Mt to 207.19 Mt. Both emissions and sinks presented significant regional differences, with the Central and Southwest regions acting as the biggest emissions and sink contributors, respectively. (2) Built-up land was the largest land carrier for carbon emissions in China, contributing over 85% to total emissions each year; and (3) at the national level, the relationships between economic growth, urbanization, and carbon emissions presented as inverted U-shaped Kuznets curves, which were also found in the majority of the 30 studied provinces. While carbon emissions may be reaching a peak in China, given the disproportionate role of built-up land in carbon emissions, efforts should be devoted to limiting urbanization and the production of associated carbon emissions. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; China; Environmental Kuznets curve; IPCC; Land use; Regional differences; Spatial-temporal changes","carbon emission; economic growth; environmental economics; growth rate; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Kuznets curve; land use; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal evolution; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071972347

With the modelling of early and late NDCs enhancing plan for 2-degree target, the required energy transition of each plan was analyzed, together with the vital challenges and potential economic impacts. Model results show: 1. Existing energy policies can reduce the annual emission growth rate to 0.6% for 2015 – 2020, while their influence on long-term mitigation is limited; 2. If enhanced NDCs begin from 2030 onwards after realizing current goals, 2-degree target would become quite challenging in later period, some regions will have to cut the energy service drastically; 3. With the assumption of early enhancement and free carbon trading in the cost-optimal enhancing plan, the total cost of global energy system could be reduced by 10% in 2050, compared with the former plan; 4. Under this cost-optimal enhancing plan, developing regions may face great challenges in short to medium term, 122% of additional investment should be put in power sector in 2030, international support on both technology and finance would be essential. © 2019","2-degree target; Current policies; Energy system; Enhanced NDC; TIMES modelling","Climate change; Costs; Emission control; Energy policy; Growth rate; Developing regions; Energy systems; Energy transformation; Energy transitions; Enhanced NDC; Existing energies; Long-term strategy; Regional energy systems; Investments; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; cost analysis; economic impact; emissions trading; energy policy; growth rate; modeling; policy implementation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065419198

Our results provide direct evidence that certain grass lineages have been specialized in specific habitats: Pooideae grasses stand out and occupy a much cooler environment than all other subfamilies; Pooideae, Aristidoideae, and Chloridoieae occupy dry environments. Pooideae grasses occupy the coldest and driest environments compared to all other subfamilies, with a mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP) of ∼13.6 to ∼15.3°C and 224 to ∼1674 mm, respectively, at a regional scale. We built a database for grasses and their corresponding climate parameters. Based on this database, past climate parameters at the margin of the Asian summer monsoon since ∼70 ka were quantitatively reconstructed by phytolith assemblages. They show that this area was dominated by cold-and dry-adapted grasses since ∼70 ka with a MAT and MAP of ∼3.3 to ∼11.0 °C and ∼442 to ∼900 mm, respectively, generally consistent with the results of phytolith-based transfer function reconstructions and with the results of previous nearby pollen-based quantitative reconstructions. With the improvement of the species-climate and ecosystem dataset, our database-based method is a promising quantitative reconstruction approach to past climatic change in the monsoon region.

However, divergent directions of phenological changes under current climate warming have been frequently reported but poorly understood. Here we collate the long-term filed phenological and climatic records at 8 sites in Inner Mongolian grassland to assess how climate changes regulate the phenological variations with divergent directions and magnitudes in this region. We found that the spring climatic changes (e.g., changes in air temperature and precipitation during March and April)correlate well with variations in SOS. However, our in situ observations show divergent changes in SOS across space, which can be attributed to the generally insignificant changes of climates during the preseasons of SOS. The climate warming prior to the end of plant growing season (EOS)was generally significant at most sites. Nevertheless, the effects of such warming on changes in EOS were possibly overshadowed by the impacts of precipitation in this arid/semi-arid region. As a result, the temporal variations in EOS distribute divergent directions and magnitudes across space and species. Using climate attributes during the preseason of EOS alone can hardly explain changes in EOS. Alternatively, by introducing changes in SOS as an additional driving factor, variations in EOS can be well represented. We therefore infer that plant phenologies can divergently response to current global warming (depending on the seasonal patterns of warming). Moreover, other influential factors such as precipitation and the interactions between the timings of different phenological stages are also needed in predicting the phenological dynamics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Grassland; Inner Mongolia; Plant phenology","Climate change; Forestry; Global warming; Grassland; In-situ observations; Influential factors; Inner Mongolia; Phenological changes; Phenological stage; Plant phenology; Temporal variation; Systems engineering; climate change; climate effect; environmental factor; global warming; grassland; growing season; phenology; plant; spring (season); air temperature; article; climate change; driver; grassland; greenhouse effect; growing season; human; Inner Mongolia; phenology; precipitation; spring; China; plant development; season; temperature; China; Nei Monggol; China; Climate Change; Global Warming; Grassland; Plant Development; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065833022

Agricultural countries, such as Nepal, depend on farmers' adaptations to climate change for local sustainable development. Limited livelihood options, unequal access to resources and information, and climate change-related floods and droughts have reduced farmer welfare. Few studies have investigated the effects of altitude in rural areas or examined livelihood adaptation strategies in Nepal. Using a survey of farmers in rural areas at high, middle, and low altitudes in Nepal, this article explores the impacts of climate change-related floods and droughts, as well as the water resource utilization, disaster resilience, and livelihood improvement ability of farmers and the influencing factors. This article adopted participatory rural appraisal to obtain survey data from farmers at three altitudes. Through one-wayANOVAand F-tests, farmers' perceptions of floods and droughts were analyzed, and through field investigations, their production and water consumption patterns were established. Logistic regressions show that college education, farming income, and domestic water consumption have the strongest impacts on households' disaster resilience, while non-farm income, male laborer rates, and college education have the strongest impacts on households' abilities to improve livelihoods. Based on our results, we offer countermeasures and suggestions on education, gender equality, and rural infrastructure construction. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Disaster resilience; Livelihood; Nepal; Water resource utilization","climate change; disaster management; flood; livelihood; nature-society relations; participatory rural appraisal; rural area; sustainable development; water resource; Kosi River; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072623788

It forms the basis for most of the cost-effective emission reductions for any given entity and improving the interior climate of a large entity. It, therefore, becomes very important to understand the baseline and monitor energy consumption periodically to proactively manage it, and as required address the gaps in improvement. An Energy Information Management System (EIMS) therefore becomes an indispensable tool for this purpose. Based on a review of the literature and practical experience, this paper provides a refreshed insight into the technologies and features that such a system should have. The latest development in the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has led to the development of stronger capabilities for data acquisition and communication for an optimized and cost-effective energy system. The enhancement in data analytics and modeling capabilities further add to the versatility in offerings and insights that such a system may provide. Therefore, it is important that an EIMS not only provides a strong information delivery mechanism subsequent to data collection but also includes expert knowledge that ensures that the stakeholders of this system receive purposeful and useful knowledge and information, not just data. This study identifies the essential characteristics of a smart EIMS for a large entity which normally includes multiple buildings and complexes with different applications, such as city councils.

It is found that conditions for the formation of titanium carbides are created in the transition layer of the film/substrate system during ion beam mixing. The formation of titanium carbides with both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric ratios of the components occurs. The concentration of titanium carbides increases with the increase in the irradiation dose and reaches 20 at % at a dose of 4 × 1017 ion/cm2. The mixing manifests itself in the mutual penetration of carbon atoms into the target and target atoms, mainly titanium, into the film. However, a thin surface layer with a depth of about 20 nm which is mainly composed of carbon atoms remains. It is shown that, in this layer, carbon atoms are in a disordered state with both sp2 and sp3 hybridization of the C–C bonds. The formation of titanium carbides in the transition layer and the disordered structure of carbon on the surface of the film during ion beam mixing determines the hardening of the surface layer, and as a result, an increase in the microhardness of the samples by 100% or more occurs. It is shown that the growth in the microhardness is associated with the layer formed as a result of mixing rather than the influence of irradiation on the titanium alloy substrate. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","carbon nanofilms; Keywords: ion beam mixing; titanium carbide; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Atoms; Carbon; Ion beams; Ions; Irradiation; Microhardness; Mixing; Morphology; Surface morphology; Titanium carbide; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Chemical compositions; Disordered state; Disordered structures; Ion beam mixing; Nano films; Non-stoichiometric ratio; Thin surface layer; Transition layers; Titanium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073202896

The main aim of the article is to evaluate the role of cultural differences for their explanation. We expect no significant differences in the attitudes related to the findings of climate research, since scientific principles are the joint basis of the scientific discourse wordwide. However, we expect that there are differences in the attitudes of the young scholars about the role of science, of the state and of the civil society for dealing with the challenge of climate change. We suggest that these can be explained with substantial cultural differences between both societies, with regard to the role of the state and the civil society for the solution of environmental problems. In order to evaluate these hypotheses, we have conducted a comparative survey among environmental science students in Qingdao (China) and Hamburg (Germany) about their attitudes towards climate change. The findings support our main hypotheses. The young scholars in Qingdao and Hamburg differ substantially in their views of the role of science in society and policymaking. Plausibly, these differences may mainly be explained with differences in the cultural ideas about the role of the state and of the civil society for the solution of environmental problems. Gradual differences in the share of young scholars who think that climate change has anthropogenic causes, may be explained with differences in the curriculum but also by cultural habits.

In the last decades, a real breakthrough in the treatment of the disease has not been achieved. Here we propose a prospective, phase II, multicentre, single-arm study aiming to assess the efficacy and the feasibility of a therapeutic protocol combining chemotherapy, carbon ion therapy and surgery for resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Method: The purpose of this trial (PIOPPO Protocol) is to assess the efficacy and the feasibility of 3 cycles of FOLFIRINOX neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by a short-course of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. Primary outcome of this study is the assessment of local progression free survival (L-PFS). The calculation of sample size is based on the analysis of the primary endpoint ""progression free survival"" according to Fleming's Procedure. Discussion: Very preliminary results provide initial evidence of the feasibility of the combined chemotherapy and CIRT in the neoadjuvant setting for resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. Completion of the accrual and long term results are awaited to see if this combination of treatment is advisable and will provide the expected benefits.

Ozone simulations with regional air quality models suffer from unexplained biases over Europe, and uncertainties in the emissions of ozone precursor group nitrogen oxides (NOx= NO+NO) contribute to these biases. The goal of this study is to use NO2 column observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite sensor to infer top-down NOx emissions in the regional Weather Research and Forecasting model with coupled chemistry (WRF-Chem) and to evaluate the impact on simulated surface O3 with in situ observations. We first perform a simulation for July 2015 over Europe and evaluate its performance against in situ observations from the AirBase network. The spatial distribution of mean ozone concentrations is reproduced satisfactorily. However, the simulated maximum daily 8h ozone concentration (MDA8 O3) is underestimated (mean bias error of -14.2μgm-3), and its spread is too low. We subsequently derive satellite-constrained surface NOx emissions using a mass balance approach based on the relative difference between OMI and WRF-Chem NO2 columns. The method accounts for feedbacks through OH, NO2's dominant daytime oxidant. Our optimized European NOx emissions amount to 0.50TgN (for July 2015), which is 0.18TgN higher than the bottom-up emissions (which lacked agricultural soil NOx emissions). Much of the increases occur across Europe, in regions where agricultural soil NOx emissions dominate. Our best estimate of soil NOx emissions in July 2015 is 0.1TgN, much higher than the bottom-up 0.02TgN natural soil NOx emissions from the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN). A simulation with satellite-updated NOx emissions reduces the systematic bias between WRF-Chem and OMI NO2 (slopeCombining double low line0.98, r2Combining double low line0.84) and reduces the low bias against independent surface NO2 measurements by 1.1μgm-3 (-56%). Following these NOx emission changes, daytime ozone is strongly affected, since NOx emission changes particularly affect daytime ozone formation. Monthly averaged simulated daytime ozone increases by 6.0μgm-3, and increases of &gt;10μgm-3 are seen in regions with large emission increases. With respect to the initial simulation, MDA8 O3 has an improved spatial distribution, expressed by an increase in r2 from 0.40 to 0.53, and a decrease of the mean bias by 7.4μgm-3 (48%). Overall, our results highlight the dependence of surface ozone on its precursor NOx and demonstrate that simulations of surface ozone benefit from constraining surface NOx emissions by satellite NO2 column observations. © Author(s) 2019.",,"air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); nitrogen oxides; ozone; spatial distribution; summer; weather forecasting; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072624176

The present research focused on the cold acclimation and characterization of sulfate-reducing bacterial (SRB) consortia enriched from an Arctic sediment sample from northern Finland. Based on 16S rDNA analysis, the most common sulfate-reducing bacterium in all enriched consortia was Desulfobulbus, which belongs to the δ-Proteobacteria. The majority of the cultivated consortia were able to reduce sulfate at temperatures as low as 6 °C with succinic acid as a carbon source. The sulfate reduction rates at 6 °C varied from 13 to 42 mg/L/d. The cultivation medium used in this research was a Postgate medium supplemented with lactate, ethanol or succinic acid. The obtained consortia were able to grow with lactate and succinic acid but surprisingly not with ethanol.

This fact is reflected in Germany’s 7th Federal Energy Research Program (EFP), which was adopted in 2018. Direct Air Capture (DAC) technologies used to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere comprise one way to achieve these reductions in greenhouse gases. DAC has been identified as a technology (group) for which there are still major technology gaps. The intention of this article is to explore the potential role of DAC for the EFP by using a multi-dimensional analysis showing the technology’s possible contributions to the German government’s energy and climate policy goals and to German industry’s global reputation in the field of modern energy technologies, as well as the possibilities of integrating DAC into the existing energy system. The results show that the future role of DAC is affected by a variety of uncertainty factors. The technology is still in an early stage of development and has yet to prove its large-scale technical feasibility, as well as its economic viability. The results of the multi-dimensional evaluation, as well as the need for further technological development, integrated assessment, and systems-level analyses, justify the inclusion of DAC technology in national energy research programs like the EFP. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon dioxide removal; Climate change; DAC; Direct Air Capture; Energy transition; Negative emission technologies; Power-to-X; Sector coupling","Climate change; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Air captures; Carbon dioxide removal; Emission technology; Energy transitions; Power-to-X; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072117986

To guide future radio observations, we estimate radio emission from known M dwarf planets using the empirical radiometric prescription derived in the Solar system, in which radio emission is powered by the wind of the host star. Using solar-like wind models, we find that the most promising exoplanets for radio detections are GJ 674 b and Proxima b, followed by YZ Cet b, GJ 1214 b, GJ 436 b. These are the systems that are the closest to us (&lt;10 pc). However, we also show that our radio fluxes are very sensitive to the unknown properties of winds of M dwarfs. So, which types of winds would generate detectable radio emission? In a ‘reverse engineering’ calculation, we show that winds with mass-loss rates M κsw/u3sw would drive planetary radio emission detectable with present-day instruments, where usw is the local stellar wind velocity and κsw is a constant that depends on the size of the planet, distance, and orbital radius.

Soil greenhouse gases (GHG) emission was positive by 17 years, but negative by 32, when soil sequestered carbon. Context: Much of the role of planted forests in the gaseous soil-atmosphere exchanges in the subtropics remains to be evaluated. Aims: To assess the impacts of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) on soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in a subtropical Cambisol. Methods: Fluxes were monitored over 1 year with static chambers, in forest stands under natural forest (NF) and pine plantation for 17 (P17) and 32 years (P32). Results: The NF soil showed the lowest N2O emission and the highest CH4 consumption, because of the lowest water-filled pore space (WFPS, &lt; 40%) and highest soil macroporosity. In P17, N2O emission was still low, but CH4 consumption diminished sixfold, possibly because of the predominance of methanotrophy, favoured by the highest WFPS (~ 80%) and lowest macroporosity that together with low mineral N concentration also did not favour the formation of N2O. In P32, the improved soil mineral N, macroporosity and intermediate WFPS (~ 60%) increased CH4 consumption and also N2O emission, in an environment supposedly favourable to methanotrophy and also to N2O production. Considering soil organic carbon (SOC) from a concurrent study, the net GHG emission (Mg Ceq ha−1 year−1) was 2.8 in P17 and − 1.1 in P32. Conclusion: Soil under pine plantation is the source of GHG in the first rotation (17 years), because of the low CH4 consumption and SOC losses, but soil becomes C sink in the second rotation (32 years), by sequestering SOC and consuming more CH4, despite emitting more N2O. © 2019, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Ammonium; GHG intensity; Nitrate; Reforestation; Southern Brazil; Temperature","ammonium; coniferous forest; denitrification; forest soil; greenhouse gas; methane; methanotrophy; nitrous oxide; reforestation; soil emission; soil moisture; soil temperature; subtropical region; Brazil; Pinus taeda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070717584

Recent onsite measurement of N2O emissions at WWTPs have been used as an alternative to the controversial theoretical methods for the N2O calculation. The full-scale N2O monitoring campaigns help to expand our knowledge on the N2O production pathways and the triggering operational conditions of processes. The accurate N2O monitoring could help to find better process control solutions to mitigate N2O emissions of wastewater treatment systems. However, quantifying the emissions and understanding the long-term behaviour of N2O fluxes in WWTPs remains challenging and costly. A review of the recent full-scale N2O monitoring campaigns is conducted. The analysis covers the quantification and mitigation of emissions for different process groups, focusing on techniques that have been applied for the identification of dominant N2O pathways and triggering operational conditions, techniques using operational data and N2O data to identify mitigation measures and mechanistic modelling. The analysis of various studies showed that there are still difficulties in the comparison of N2O emissions and the development of emission factor (EF) databases; the N2O fluxes reported in literature vary significantly even among groups of similar processes. The results indicated that the duration of the monitoring campaigns can impact the EF range. Most N2O monitoring campaigns lasting less than one month, have reported N2O EFs less than 0.3% of the N-load, whereas studies lasting over a year have a median EF equal to 1.7% of the N-load. The findings of the current study indicate that complex feature extraction and multivariate data mining methods can efficiently convert wastewater operational and N2O data into information, determine complex relationships within the available datasets and boost the long-term understanding of the N2O fluxes behaviour. The acquisition of reliable full-scale N2O monitoring data is significant for the calibration and validation of the mechanistic models -describing the N2O emission generation in WWTPs. They can be combined with the multivariate tools to further enhance the interpretation of the complicated full-scale N2O emission patterns. Finally, a gap between the identification of effective N2O mitigation strategies and their actual implementation within the monitoring and control of WWTPs has been identified. This study concludes that there is a further need for i) long-term N2O monitoring studies, ii) development of data-driven methodological approaches for the analysis of WWTP operational and N2O data, and iii) better understanding of the trade-offs among N2O emissions, energy consumption and system performance to support the optimization of the WWTPs operation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emission factors; Full-scale monitoring campaigns; Mechanistic models; Mitigation measures; Multivariate data mining methods; Nitrous oxide; Production pathways; Triggering operational conditions","Biological water treatment; Carbon footprint; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Monitoring; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Process control; Reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Emission factors; Full-scale monitoring campaigns; Mechanistic models; Mitigation measures; Multivariate data; Nitrous oxide; Operational conditions; Production pathways; Data mining; nitrous oxide; nitrogen; carbon footprint; data mining; factor analysis; literature review; multivariate analysis; nitrous oxide; numerical model; optimization; pollutant removal; pollution monitoring; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; anaerobic digestion; benchmarking; carbon footprint; catalyst; chemical oxygen demand; comparative study; controlled study; data mining; energy consumption; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; feature extraction; heavy metal removal; limit of quantitation; microbial community; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; process control; Review; seasonal variation; waste water management; carbon footprint; sewage; waste water; Carbon Footprint; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067301716

From the 47 reviewed publications of this review 91% reported on poplar or willow SRC, and 63% focused on animal diversity. The α- and β-diversity were most often studied by quantifying species richness and abundance. SRC had a positive effect on fungal diversity, which was negatively correlated to coppice rotation length, due to a higher nutrient demand after coppicing. In comparison with agricultural monocultures SRC provides a higher biodiversity, but it remains lower than that of mixed deciduous forests. Besides the planted genera and species, an understorey of generalist species similar to the previous land use develops and evolves to a forest-like understorey. At every coppice rotation the light availability changes and the planted area evolves from a bare field to a shrub-like vegetation, which later approaches a forest with a closed canopy. These changes in the plant community influence animal diversity. Bird populations similarly evolve from open-space to forest communities, continuously co-existing in shifting ratios. Arthropods and small mammals use the SRC to fulfil all of their habitat needs, while birds and large mammals only use the SRC for a limited number of resources. Recommendations for policy makers and SRC growers are provided, and areas for future research have been identified. It is concluded that introducing well-managed SRCs can enrich biodiversity in an agriculture-dominated landscape, but that SRCs most probably have a negative effect on biodiversity when introduced into a highly forested landscape. © 2019","Animal diversity; Bioenergy; Climate change mitigation; Fungal diversity; Phytodiversity; SRC","Biodiversity; Birds; Climate change; Cultivation; Decision making; Land use; Mammals; Plants (botany); Rotation; Alpha and beta diversities; Bio-energy; Climate change mitigation; Forested landscapes; Fungal diversity; Light availability; Phytodiversity; Short rotation coppice; Forestry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065595566

Box 80203, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","A 5-year Clean Air Action Plan was implemented in 2013 to reduce air pollutant emissions and improve ambient air quality in Beijing. Assessment of this action plan is an essential part of the decision-making process to review its efficacy and to develop new policies. Both statistical and chemical transport modelling have been previously applied to assess the efficacy of this action plan. However, inherent uncertainties in these methods mean that new and independent methods are required to support the assessment process. Here, we applied a machine-learning-based random forest technique to quantify the effectiveness of Beijing's action plan by decoupling the impact of meteorology on ambient air quality. Our results demonstrate that meteorological conditions have an important impact on the year-to-year variations in ambient air quality. Further analyses show that the PM 2.5 mass concentration would have broken the target of the plan (2017 annual PM2.5 &lt;60 μg m-3) were it not for the meteorological conditions in winter 2017 favouring the dispersion of air pollutants. However, over the whole period (2013-2017), the primary emission controls required by the action plan have led to significant reductions in PM2.5/span PM10/NO2, SO2, and CO from 2013 to 2017 of approximately 34 %, 24 %, 17 %, 68 %, and 33 %, respectively, after meteorological correction. The marked decrease in PM2.5 and SO2 is largely attributable to a reduction in coal combustion. Our results indicate that the action plan has been highly effective in reducing the primary pollution emissions and improving air quality in Beijing. The action plan offers a successful example for developing air quality policies in other regions of China and other developing countries. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

The scientific field of urban energy and carbon modelling is becoming a fundamental instrument to estimate an energy and carbon baseline at a point in time and to quantify the impact that policy-driven technological interventions that could have on the overall carbon footprint of a city. This capability enables an evidence-based approach in which the economic case towards a low-carbon economy can be made. Transformative local distributed energy technologies such as CHP or district heating have a strong spatial component due to a need to identify synergies with adjacent properties or heating loads. Currently available domestic building energy models often do not take into account spatial information. Accessing geo-referenced data for energy modelling can also be particularly useful as validated outputs (i.e. heating and electricity loads, energy profiles) can be mapped using spatial modelling techniques that help to easily identify high and low energy consumption areas and potential synergies in local energy infrastructure planning. In Newcastle upon Tyne UK, the council is exploring the opportunities for the installation of renewable heat technologies on their own stock as a matter of urgency. Identification of potential sites and feasibility for technical and financial applicability within the UK policies will be addressed by this paper. © 2019 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Binary alloys; Carbon footprint; District heating; Energy utilization; Renewable energy resources; Distributed energies; Domestic buildings; Energy infrastructures; Energy policy planning; Low carbon economy; Low energy consumption; Potential synergies; Spatial informations; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072166274

Predicting changes to O3 is therefore important for both air quality and near-term climate forcing. It is computationally expensive to predict changes in tropospheric O3 from every possible future scenario in composition climate models like those used in the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Here we apply the different emission pathways used in CMIP6 with a model based on source-receptor relationships for tropospheric O3 to predict historical and future changes in O3 and its radiative forcing over a 300 year period (1750–2050). Changes in regional precursor emissions (nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds) and global methane abundance are used to quantify the impact on tropospheric O3 globally and across 16 regions, neglecting any impact from changes in climate. We predict large increases in global surface O3 (+8 ppbv) and O3 radiative forcing (+0.3 W m−2) over the industrial period. Nine different Shared Socio-economic Pathways are used to assess future changes in O3. Scenarios involving weak air pollutant controls and climate mitigation are inadequate in limiting the future degradation of surface O3 air quality and enhancement of near-term climate warming over all regions. Middle-of-the-road and strong mitigation scenarios reduce both surface O3 concentrations and O3 radiative forcing by up to 5 ppbv and 0.17 W m−2 globally, providing benefits to future air quality and near-term climate forcing. Sensitivity experiments show that targeting mitigation measures towards reducing global methane abundances could yield additional benefits for both surface O3 air quality and near-term climate forcing.

The concentrations of 28 target alkanes and 43 target polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were determined in water samples collected on 10 offshore cruises, in 19 water samples collected monthly one km offshore at 13 inshore stations in 2010 and 2013, and in 16–60 surficial marsh sediment samples collected on each of 26 trips. The concentration of total aromatics in offshore waters peaked in late summer, 2010, at 100 times above the May, 2010 values, which were already slightly contaminated. There were no differences in surface or bottom water samples. The concentration of total aromatics declined at a rate of 73% y−1 to 1/1000th of the May 2010 values by summer 2016. The concentrations inside the estuary were proportional to those one km offshore, but were 10–30% lower. The oil concentrations in sediments were initially different at 1 and 10 m distance into the marsh, but became equal after 2 years. Thus, the distinction between oiled and unoiled sites became blurred, if not non-existent then, and oiling had spread over an area wider than was visible initially. The concentrations of oil in sediments were 100–1000 times above the May 2010 values, and dropped to 10 times higher after 8 years, thereafter, demonstrating a long-term contamination by oil or oil residues that will remain for decades. The chemical signature of the oil residues offshore compared to in the marsh reflects the more aerobic offshore conditions and water-soluble tendencies of the dissolved components, whereas the anaerobic marsh sediments will retain the heavier molecular components for a long time, and have a consequential effect on the ecosystems.

The introduction of petroleum hydrocarbons into a pristine environment immediately changes the nature of that environment, resulting in reduced ecosystem functionality. Natural attenuation represents the single, most important biological process which removes petroleum hydrocarbons from the environment. It is a process where microorganisms present at the site degrade the organic contaminants without the input of external bioremediation enhancers (i.e., electron donors, electron acceptors, other microorganisms or nutrients). So successful is this natural attenuation process that in environmental biotechnology, bioremediation has developed steadily over the past 50 years based on this natural biodegradation process. Bioremediation is recognized as the most environmentally friendly remediation approach for the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from an environment as it does not require intensive chemical, mechanical, and costly interventions. However, it is under-utilized as a commercial remediation strategy due to incomplete hydrocarbon catabolism and lengthy remediation times when compared with rival technologies. This review aims to describe the fate of petroleum hydrocarbons in the environment and discuss their interactions with abiotic and biotic components of the environment under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, the mechanisms for dealing with petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in the environment will be examined. When petroleum hydrocarbons contaminate land, they start to interact with its surrounding, including physical (dispersion), physiochemical (evaporation, dissolution, sorption), chemical (photo-oxidation, auto-oxidation), and biological (plant and microbial catabolism of hydrocarbons) interactions. As microorganism (including bacteria and fungi) play an important role in the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons, investigations into the microbial communities within contaminated soils is essential for any bioremediation project. This review highlights the fate of petroleum hydrocarbons in tertial environments, as well as the contributions of different microbial consortia for optimum petroleum hydrocarbon bioremediation potential. The impact of high-throughput metagenomic sequencing in determining the underlying degradation mechanisms is also discussed. This knowledge will aid the development of more efficient, cost-effective commercial bioremediation technologies. © 2019 by the authors","Bioremediation; Microbial consortia; Natural attenuation; Petroleum hydrocarbon (PH)","hydrocarbon; petroleum; bioremediation; drug effect; ecosystem; microflora; oil spill; Biodegradation, Environmental; Ecosystem; Hydrocarbons; Microbiota; Petroleum; Petroleum Pollution",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072558643

As the world's fourth largest coal consumer, Japan's efforts to reduce coal usage are critical for international climate mitigation. Policies introduced after the Fukushima nuclear disaster have led to a rapid increase in solar. However deregulation of the electricity market has also prompted a rush of new CFPP constructions by new market entrants and incumbent utilities. In parallel, Japanese state agencies and industry are actively exporting CFPP technologies to developing countries. Although these domestic and international actions harbour serious consequences for global climate mitigation efforts, greater understanding of the factors driving Japan's coal dependency is needed to limit further lock-in of future carbon emissions. Filling this gap, this study critically examines narratives employed by actors in government and industry to sustain Japan's domestic and international coal industry. Our analysis shows how Japan's fossil fuel regime is employing recurring narratives to promote continuation of the current coal-based energy system and to mobilise further investments in high-efficiency coal power technologies. We conclude by recommending various policy pathways and institutional reform measures aimed at encouraging wider diffusion of renewable electricity sources while reducing coal dependency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coal; Energy transition; Fossil fuel regimes; Fossil fuels phase-out; Japanese energy policy; Narratives","Coal; Commerce; Deregulation; Developing countries; Economic geology; Fossil fuel power plants; Fuels; Investments; Climate mitigations; Coal-fired electricity; Coal-fired power plant; Energy transitions; Fukushima nuclear disasters; Institutional reforms; Narratives; Renewable electricity; Coal industry; alternative energy; coal-fired power plant; electricity generation; energy policy; energy resource; fossil fuel; policy reform; solar power; transitional economy; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067672686

As we know, cement is a key building material that is commonly used but also creates pollution during its manufacturing, storage handling, transportation and usage. So, what-if this building material can be significantly replaced by some other building material that is far eco-friendlier. Mother Nature i.e. our planet Earth offers us naturally existing and abundant Soil (mud) that can be used as an alternative building material. Cement, as a main component of construction material mix, when replaced by naturally and locally available mineral soil (in different proportions) will result in reduced carbon footprints which otherwise is high for cement supply chain. This nature’s gift in the form of mineral soil has inspired the idea of Rammed Earth Construction. This is not an invention; it is an innovation through traditional (well placed) wisdom. Natural soil with additives (if required) in designed/customized amount are compacted in layers within sturdy formwork. From series of field experiments we conducted, the proportions for the components like Soil, (part) Cement and Fly Ash were determined. The proportion of these constituents mainly depends on local availability and climatic condition in & around the construction site. The resultant construction product mix is a monolithic wall structure with superior thermal insulation properties, fire resistant and most importantly eco-friendly. The Due to use of soil, the wall absorbs heat during day time and slowly cools down in night time. This phenomenon results in effective insulation system. This moderates daily temperaturevariations and reduces the need for HVAC systems, which helps in attaining the green building objective. One of the prominent features of Rammed Earth Structure is its cost efficiency. The main component is naturally available mineral soil and other resources required are also available at a comparatively low cost. A structure (say home wall) can be built using Rammed Earth in approximately 1/5thcost than that required for Stone wall. So, Rammed Earth based construction projects can be linked to Government’s Low-Cost Housing schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY, PMGAY). For building Rammed Earth Structures, unskilled labors can be easily trained and hence creates a good opportunity to employ unemployed people including locals. In this way this project can tangibly contribute to bring about a socioeconomic shift/change. © BEIESP.","Cost Efficiency; Mineral Soil; Socioeconomic; Sustainable Home",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073554360

All of the studied meteorological stations in coastal regions have shown a negative trend in the cold spell duration and a positive trend in the warm spell duration. The trend analysis has shown a greater increase in the warm spell duration for lower latitude as well as a greater decrease in the cold spell duration for higher latitude over the analyzed period. Because of this behavior, these stations categorized into two large groups. The southern coastal region is somewhat wet and warm climate, this caused the diurnal temperature range has not been much enough for the agricultural production process which need enough differences between daytime base maximum and nighttime base minimum of the temperatures.

This externality has direct environmental, economic and public health consequences. This paper aims at investigating the space-time patterns of traffic air pollution in Balneário Camboriú (Brazil) over projected temporal scenarios and at estimating the damage costs of traffic air pollution to support transport policy-making. Methods: To estimate the emission rates of pollutants, emission factors and traffic data were jointly used, whereas the pollutant concentrations were estimated using the Gaussian plume dispersion model. To identify the affected areas as well as possible spatial heterogeneity patterns of air pollution within clustered areas, an exploratory spatial analysis was also conducted. To assess the economic impact of air pollution, damage costs were calculated for various pollutants. Results: The modeling results show that oxides of nitrogen (NO2) and oxides of sulphur (SO2) pollutants exceed the limits of air quality legislation, especially at a distance up to 10 m from the roads, while 60% and 71% of the intersections are found to yield pollutant concentrations above the thresholds, primarily during peak hours. The analysis also confirmed that homogeneous traffic zones with similar emission rates are spatially clustered exhibiting positive autocorrelation patterns. The results of the economic appraisal showed that the estimated costs of traffic-related emissions were $0.89, $1.38 and $1.43 million/year, respectively, for the current, short-term and long-term scenarios. Conclusions: This study serves as the first comprehensive analysis of traffic air pollution for the specific study region, providing implications and modeling tools that can be leveraged in public policies focusing on the elimination of the transportation-generated health burden. The developed analysis framework can also serve as a supporting tool for Public Agencies focusing on the high-level evaluation of traffic-related air pollution using limited and aggregate spatial and traffic data. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Brazil; Damage costs; Emission factors; Exploratory spatial data analysis; Traffic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069609172

In the past few years, China's government has made strong efforts to reduce PM2:5 pollution. However, another important pollutant (ozone) is becoming a problem in eastern China. Ozone (O3) is produced by photochemistry, which requires solar radiation for the formation of O3. Under heavy PM2:5 pollution, solar radiation is often depressed, and the photochemical production of O3 is prohibited. This study shows that during late spring and early fall in eastern China, under heavy PM2:5 pollution, there was often strong O3 photochemical production, causing a co-occurrence of high PM2:5 and O3 concentrations. This co-occurrence of high PM2:5 and O3 is unusual and is the main focus of this study. Recent measurements show that there were often high HONO surface concentrations in major Chinese megacities, especially during daytime, with maximum concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2 ppbv. It is also interesting to note that high HONO concentrations occurred during high aerosol concentration periods, suggesting that there were additional HONO surface sources in eastern China. Under high daytime HONO concentrations, HONO can be photodissociated to OH radicals, which enhance the photochemical production of O3. In order to study the above scientific issues, a radiative transfer model (TUV; tropospheric ultraviolet-visible) is used in this study, and a chemical steady-state model is established to calculate OH radical concentrations. The calculations show that by including the OH production of photodissociated HONO, the calculated OH concentrations are significantly higher than the values without including this production. For example, by including HONO production, the maximum OH concentration under high aerosol conditions (AODD2.5) is similar to the value under low aerosol conditions (AODD0.25) in the no-HONO case. This result suggests that even under high aerosol conditions, the chemical oxidizing process for O3 production can occur, which explains the co-occurrence of high PM2:5 and high O3 in late spring and early fall in eastern China. However, the O3 concentrations were not significantly affected by the appearance of HONO in winter. This study shows that the seasonal variation of solar radiation plays important roles for controlling the OH production in winter. Because solar radiation is at a very low level in winter, adding the photolysis of HONO has a smaller effect in winter than in other seasons, and OH remains at low values by including the HONO production term. This study provides some important scientific insight to better understand O3 pollution in eastern China. © Author(s) 2019.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072046978

A novel superstructure of the proposed hybrid energy system comprised of an enhanced geothermal system, a torrefied biomass-based combustion system, and a deep water source cooling system with conventional chillers as auxiliaries, is developed. Based on the superstructure of the proposed hybrid energy system, we develop a multi-period optimization model to minimize a fractional metric, the levelized cost. Because the main product of the hybrid energy system is heat, the levelized cost is expressed as levelized cost of heat, with other byproducts indirectly incorporated by using credits. The resulting nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear fractional programming problem is efficiently solved by using a tailored optimization algorithm. Two case studies based on Cornell's campus in Ithaca, New York are presented to quantify the effect of different electric power sources on the technoeconomic objective, as well as the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. The first case study considers electric power from natural gas, while a carbon-neutral electric power supply based on renewable geothermal energy is envisioned in the second case study. Results show that switching the electric power supply from natural gas to geothermal energy could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 24.5%, while only increasing the levelized cost of heat by 5.6%. The carbon footprint for both case studies are promisingly low, compared with numerous existing heat generation technologies. Through sensitivity analysis, the project lifetime is identified as the most influential input parameter. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Deep water source cooling; Geothermal energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hybrid energy system; Levelized cost; Polygeneration","Biomass; Carbon footprint; Cooling; Cooling systems; Electric power systems; Geothermal energy; Geothermal fields; Geothermal heating; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Life cycle; Natural gas; Sensitivity analysis; Deep Water; Enhanced geothermal systems; Hybrid energy system; Levelized costs; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Nonlinear fractional programming; Optimization algorithms; Poly-generation; Gas emissions; biomass; carbon footprint; combustion; cooling; cost analysis; deep water; electrical power; emission; geothermal energy; greenhouse gas; heating; life cycle analysis; natural gas; Ithaca [New York]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065222933

We aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL), respiratory symptoms and residential distance. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 380 subjects who were interviewed using the SF-36 Quality of Life Instrument, respiratory symptoms also being assessed. Residential distance was measured using a geographic information system (GIS) tool. PM10 and crystalline silica concentrations were measured by 41 samplers from 11 stone-mortar factories. The results showed that the average PM10 and silica concentrations were lower than recommendations by NIOSH and ACGIH, while the crystalline silica concentrations were higher. The average scores of the physical components HRQOL were higher than those of a control group of Thai volunteers. The overall HRQOL findings were significantly different in age, income, education, occupation, respiratory symptoms, underlying diseases and residential distance. The multivariable analysis indicated that residential distance was associated with physical, mental and overall HRQOL after adjusting for age, respiratory symptoms and underlying diseases. Therefore, the local policy makers need to facilitate the reduction in air pollution from stone factories to improve respiratory health and quality of life. © 2019, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment.

Nevertheless, for both approaches, the relatively small number of available observations in northern high-latitude regions leaves gaps in our understanding of the drivers and distributions of the different types of regional methane sources. Observations of methane isotope ratios, performed with instruments that are becoming increasingly affordable and accurate, could bring new insights on the contributions of methane sources and sinks. Here, we present the source signal that could be observed from methane isotopic 13CH4 measurements if high-resolution observations were available and thus what requirements should be fulfilled in future instrument deployments in terms of accuracy in order to constrain different emission categories. This theoretical study uses the regional chemistry-transport model CHIMERE driven by different scenarios of isotopic signatures for each regional methane source mix. It is found that if the current network of methane monitoring sites were equipped with instruments measuring the isotopic signal continuously, only sites that are significantly influenced by emission sources could differentiate regional emissions with a reasonable level of confidence. For example, wetland emissions require daily accuracies lower than 0.2‰ for most of the sites. Detecting East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) emissions requires accuracies lower than 0.05 ‰ at coastal Russian sites (even lower for other sites). Freshwater emissions would be detectable with an uncertainty lower than 0.1 ‰ for most continental sites. Except Yakutsk, Siberian sites require stringent uncertainty (lower than 0.05‰) to detect anthropogenic emissions from oil and gas or coal production. Remote sites such as Zeppelin, Summit, or Alert require a daily uncertainty below 0.05 ‰ to detect any regional sources. These limits vary with the hypothesis on isotopic signatures assigned to the different sources. © 2019 Author(s).",,"assessment method; atmospheric chemistry; concentration (composition); detection method; isotopic composition; methane; source apportionment; Arctic; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Zeppelin Station",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073076171

The engine used for this experimental work is a single cylinder CI engine with a rated power of 5.2 kW at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The BECCS approach is a combination of plant-based biofuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS) system. The whole investigation was done in four phases: (1) Substituting diesel with Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME) (2) Equal volume blending of Orange oil (ORG) with KOME (3) 20% blending of n-butanol (B) with KOME-ORG blend (4) CCS system with zeolite based non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR) and mono ethanolamine (MEA) based selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) system with KOME-ORG + B20 blend. The experimental results show that substitution of diesel with KOME reduces smoke emission, but increases NO and CO2 emission. KOME-ORG blend reduces CO2 and smoke emissions with high NO emission due to combustion improvement. In comparison with the sole combustion of KOME at full load condition, the combination of KOME-ORG + B20 as bio-fuel with zeolite based post-combustion treatment system resulted in a maximum reduction of NO, smoke and CO2 emission by 41%, 19% and 15% respectively. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","BECCS; CO2 emission; NSCR; SNCR; ternary blends","Biofuels; Blending; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Diesel engines; Ethanolamines; Reduction; Selective catalytic reduction; Smoke; Zeolites; After-treatment; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Combined effect; Global emissions; Harmful emissions; Selective non-catalytic reduction; Single cylinders; Treatment systems; Carbon capture; biodiesel; biofuel; butanol; carbon dioxide; ester derivative; ethanolamine; Karanja oil methyl ester; nitrogen oxide; orange oil; vegetable oil; zeolite; biofuel; carbon monoxide; gasoline; biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; combustion; emission control; engine; exhaust emission; experimental study; nitrous oxide; smoke; zeolite; bioenergy; bioenergy with carbon capture and storage; carbon capture and storage system; carbon footprint; catalysis; combustion; compression ignition engine; controlled study; diesel engine; experimental study; methodology; reduction (chemistry); smoke; aftercare; exhaust gas; human; Aftercare; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Gasoline; Humans; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044338140

Many eCO2 experiments suggest that nutrient limitations modulate the local magnitude of the eCO2 effect on plant biomass1,3,5, but the global extent of these limitations has not been empirically quantified, complicating projections of the capacity of plants to take up CO2 7,8. Here, we present a data-driven global quantification of the eCO2 effect on biomass based on 138 eCO2 experiments. The strength of CO2 fertilization is primarily driven by nitrogen (N) in ~65% of global vegetation and by phosphorus (P) in ~25% of global vegetation, with N- or P-limitation modulated by mycorrhizal association. Our approach suggests that CO2 levels expected by 2100 can potentially enhance plant biomass by 12 ± 3% above current values, equivalent to 59 ± 13 PgC. The global-scale response to eCO2 we derive from experiments is similar to past changes in greenness9 and biomass10 with rising CO2, suggesting that CO2 will continue to stimulate plant biomass in the future despite the constraining effect of soil nutrients. Our research reconciles conflicting evidence on CO2 fertilization across scales and provides an empirical estimate of the biomass sensitivity to eCO2 that may help to constrain climate projections. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070793012

This specificity significantly differentiates the Danube navigation from navigation on other inland waterways in Europe, which provided year-round through depths, range of transitions to ten times less, and the work carried out for the most part self-propelled dry cargo and tanker vessels. The study deals with the build a common model for managing energy efficiency and environmental performance of a self-propelled river towing and traction fleet. The differences in transportation technologies in international maritime, European inland and Danube shipping are shown. The issues of rationing of harmful emissions into the atmosphere in shipping on European inland waterways are considered. The analysis of energy efficiency indicators established in international maritime shipping, as well as the peculiarities of their use in inland navigation, was carried out. The principles of the application of energy efficiency indicators to the assessment of environmental indicators of ships in inland navigation have been determined, taking into account the specifics of navigation conditions and other factors determining the operating modes of the ship propulsion complex. Innovative approach in the study lies in the fact that in the known studies carried out earlier, were considered the Danube fleet operating on the upper sections of the Danube. According to this, the practical solution to the problem of determining the potential to reduce harmful emissions for the existing fleet as well as the formation of the concept of energy efficiency management in the shipping industry is unresolved. Consequently, the ways of achieving energy efficiency while reducing the amount of harmful emissions into the atmosphere were identified. A possibility of controlling characteristics of energy efficiency of existing Danube traction and self-propelled fleet without significant modernization and upgrades is presented. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air pollution; Environmental management; Fleet operations; Inland waterways; Navigation; Ship propulsion; Ships; Traction control; Efficiency managements; Energy efficiency indicator; Environmental indicators; Environmental performance; Innovative approaches; International maritime shippings; Navigation conditions; Transportation technology; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074829350

Both policy support and cost reductions have greatly driven the development of renewable energy technologies, especially wind and solar power generation technologies. Considering the cost uncertainty of renewables, we developed a National Energy Technology-Power model to assess the possible low-carbon transition pathways for six regional power industries using four renewable energy cost change scenarios. Resource endowments and technology developments trends were also considered to achieve an effective and coordinated utilization of various resources. The results show that declining renewable energy costs have a great impact on the spatial and temporal development of power generation technologies, and on the interregional clean power transmission. If the investment costs of renewable energy technologies continue to decline at a high speed and the renewables could be dramatically developed, the CO2 emissions of China's power industry is expected to peak at 3.12 GtCO2 in 2026. Accordingly, the capacity share of renewable energy technologies in regional power industries would exceed 50% except in East China, and the total installed coal-fired technology capacity would fall to 760.2 GW in 2050. In addition, to promote the optimal allocation of resources, the total amounts of interregional clean power transmission are suggested to be 416 TWh in 2035 and 587 TWh in 2050, i.e., 4.9% and 5.5% of the total amount of power generation, respectively. 106 TWh of wind power is expected to be exported from Northwest to Center and East regions in 2050; and 112 TWh of solar power is suggested to be exported from North to Center, East and South regions. The Northwest region is the largest exporter of clean power while the East region is the main importer. These conclusions could support the regional plan of power transmission network. © 2019","Cost uncertainty; National energy technology-power model; Power industry; Regional low-carbon transition; Spatial and temporal uncertainty; Technological pathway","Carbon; Cost reduction; Electric power transmission networks; Investments; Power transmission; Regional planning; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Cost uncertainty; Low-carbon transitions; Power industry; Power model; Technological pathways; Temporal uncertainty; Electric power system interconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065814182

We construct four separate models with several different labor market specifications: (1) a model without labor market distortions; (2) a model with taxinteraction effects in the labor market; (3) a model with a minimum wage; and (4) a model in which a wage curve determines wages. We use these models to analyze how the effects of IET change according to model specification. The main results from the analysis are as follows. First, we found that IET generates gains for all participants in the model without labor market distortions. Second, even in the models with labor market distortions, importers of emissions permits are highly likely to benefit. Conversely, we show that the possibility of a welfare loss from IET is not as small for exporters of permits. In particular, in the minimum wage and wage curve models, we found that the exporters of emissions permits are likely to be disadvantaged. However, this also depends on the region in question. For example, China is likely to suffer under IET, whereas Russia is likely to benefit. Finally, if we implement policies to alleviate labor market distortion simultaneously with emissions regulation, all regions receive benefit from IET. © 2019, The Author(s).","Computable general equilibrium analysis; International emissions trading; Labor market","Emission control; Employment; Specifications; Wages; Computable general equilibrium; Computable general equilibrium model; Emissions regulations; Emissions Trading; Labor markets; Model specifications; Welfare loss; Commerce; computable general equilibrium analysis; emissions trading; environmental economics; global perspective; labor market; minimum wage; policy implementation; China; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060192794

Much of the output expansion has occurred in carbon- and biodiversity-rich forest lands of Malaysia and Indonesia (M&I), contributing to record levels of terrestrial carbon emissions and biodiversity loss. This has led to a variety of voluntary and mandatory regulatory actions, as well as calls for limits on palm oil imports from M&I. This paper offers a comprehensive, global assessment of the economic and environmental consequences of alternative policies aimed at limiting deforestation from oil palm expansion in M&I. It highlights the challenges of limiting forest and biodiversity loss in the presence of market-mediated spillovers into related oilseed and agricultural commodity and factor markets, both in M&I and overseas. Indeed, limiting palm oil production or consumption is unlikely to halt deforestation in M&I in the absence of active forest conservation incentives. Policies aimed at restricting palm oil production in M&I also have broader consequences for the economy, including significant impacts on consumer prices, real wages, and welfare, that vary among different global regions. A crucial distinction is whether the initiative is undertaken domestically, in which case the M&I region could benefit, or by major palm oil importers, in which case M&I loses income. Nonetheless, all policies considered here pass the social welfare test of global carbon dioxide mitigation benefits exceeding their costs. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Due to Ag(d) and O(p) states forming the upper part of the valence band and C(p), N(p), and Ag(s) the lower part of the conduction band, the band gap of the hybrid material is reduced from 2.75 eV for Ag3PO4(111) and 3.13 eV for monolayer of g-C3N4 to about 2.52 eV, enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the Ag3PO4(111) surface and g-C3N4 sheet in the visible region. We have also investigated possible reaction pathways for photocatalytic CO2 reduction on the Ag3PO4(111)/g-C3N4 nanocomposite to determine the most favored adsorption geometries of reaction intermediates and the related reaction energies. For CO2 reduction, our findings demonstrate that the Ag3PO4(111)/g-C3N4 heterostructure thermodynamically exhibits a higher selectivity toward CH4 production than that of CH3OH. The CO2 reduction process takes place through either HCOOH∗ or HOCOH∗ as an intermediate species, where the highest exothermic reaction energy of -2.826 eV belongs to the hydrogenation of t-COOH∗ to HCOOH∗ and the lowest reaction energy of -0.182 eV for hydrogenations of CH2O∗ to CH2OH∗ and HCO∗ to c-HCOH. Our results from charge density difference calculations of the Ag3PO4(111)/Ag/g-C3N4 revealed that the charge transfer between the Ag3PO4(111) slab and g-C3N4 monolayer occurs through mediation of atomic Ag, thus proposing a Z-scheme mechanism. Moreover, a smaller band gap energy of 0.73 eV is calculated for this ternary nanocomposite due to the midgap states of the atomic Ag at the interface.

In these calculations, due to their static scheme, it is possible to distinguish supported plates, plates fixed on four edges and plates with one edge free and three fixed. The subject literature contains publications on plates or tanks with walls of a constant thickness, however, there are very few references on plates or tanks with walls of linearly variable thickness. The wall plate of a tank is subject to hydrostatic load or soil pressure and might be exposed to thermal load in the case of, i.e. filling it with hot liquid or during climate action. The article presents the results of static calculations for rectangular plates with a linearly variable thickness, a trapezoidal cross-section, three fixed edges and one edge free, subjected to permanent and thermal loads. Trapezoidal cross-section walls are optimal when used in structures where load distribution is triangular in shape (hydrostatic load). For tanks recessed in the ground, the load on walls increases along with the depth of foundations and obtains the highest value in the bottom part of the wall. Trapezoidal or triangular load distribution causes that the highest values of bending moments in the vertical cross-section occur at the point where a wall connects to the bottom, while the upper free edge of the tank takes zero value. The above statements lead to the conclusion that structural and economic considerations should determine the choice of walls with a thickness increasing along with the tank depth, since it is more economical in terms of material usage. The impact of thermal load is often neglected in the design process, which may cause operational problems and even pose a threat to the safety of use. In addition to the numerical analysis, the article presents the results of model tests for a plate with a linearly variable thickness made of resin, subjected to thermal load. The convergence of the obtained results proves the correctness of calculations and tests performed.

A subproduct of the oil palm industry (palm oil fatty acid distillate) is used to supplement the Stylosanthes leaf meal with sufficient energy to produce a complete pelleted feed. Customer case studies showed that Stylosanthes-based feeds are highly palatable and improve health and performance of farm animals (horses, rabbits, calves, sheep, and goats) over that observed when using grain-based feeds. The improved quality of Stylosanthes-based over grain-based feed for ruminants could play an important role in the reduction of methane emissions and their negative consequences for climate change. A sustainable system whereby Stylosanthes is planted in association with plantation trees is proposed, providing a supplementary income for tree farmers and other benefits, such as weed control and soil amelioration. Stylosanthes can be rotated with sugarcane and pineapple, and cash flow projections show that Stylosanthes leaf meal production would be a favorable alternative activity for local farmers, yielding a greater and more constant income than sugarcane. Achieving economy of scale in the industrial process would permit production at lower cost to compete with the price of imported grain-based feed. Lack of finance is currently the major obstacle to scaling up the process, implementing the technology in different countries, and obtaining the concomitant benefits of food security, import substitution, improved ecological sustainability, and healthiness of animal products. © The Author(s) 2019.","early weaning; feed pellets; food security; grain-based feed; horse feed; import substitution; methane emissions; Stylosanthes leaf meal; tropical alfalfa; tropical forage legumes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071506934

This goal has its source in several justifications. The first is the need to meet the social and housing needs of households. The second is fuel poverty (energy poverty), including heat (thermal) poverty in Polish households, the natural result of which is the phenomenon of near-ground emissions, being a measure of the level of energy and climate security in local and national terms. The third is the impact of near-ground emissions on the standard of climate safety, as expressed in environmental pollution (of air, soil and water). The fourth is the use of geothermal energy as a significant thermal energy potential which makes it possible to significantly reduce the phenomenon of near-ground emissions and their consequences in terms of energy and climate security.The topics of research addressed in the article will focus on three issues: Defining near-ground emissions and their constituent factors; explaining the impact of near-ground emissions on the quality of the natural environment and infrastructure, and showing to what extent geothermal energy can be an important source of heat in combating near-ground emissions as well as responding to the energy and climate security strategy policy. The research problem addressed in the article is theoretical and empirical. The methods used include analysis, definition, synthesis as well as generalization and inference. Such an approach aims to identify the essence and analyse the concepts of the research subject while also defining and demonstrating the dynamics of the phenomena, along with the processes and relations indicated in previous Polish and international literature on the subject. The empirical part of the work uses quantitative and qualitative research methods in order to examine (determine) the magnitude of household heat poverty which leads to near-ground emissions, as well as to determine the temporal and spatial characteristics of atmospheric air pollution. These studies make it possible to determine the distribution and intensity of the phenomena studied, as well as to make inferences and indicate the cause and effect relationships between these phenomena. © 2019 IEEE.","energy and climate security; geothermal energy; near-ground emissions; pollution of the natural environment; thermal energy","Emission control; Heating; Security systems; Soil pollution; Water pollution; Cause-and-effect relationships; Emissions reduction; Environmental pollutions; Natural environments; Quantitative and qualitative researches; Research problems; Security strategies; Temporal and spatial; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083075935

Dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) is an environmental stressor that was previously shown to upregulate the stress axis in fish and also causes voluntary avoidance. Variation in individual state or context, such as whether an animal is fasted or fed, can alter animal behavior, including the response to environmental challenges. In the current study, we sought to define the influence of nutritional status on the response of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides to elevated CO2. Two groups of Largemouth Bass—one fed group and one fasted group—were first subjected to a CO2 shuttling protocol to define avoidance thresholds, followed by a CO2 tolerance protocol to define the time required to lose equilibrium and recover. Data showed that although feeding and fasting had no influence on the avoidance of CO2, fasted fish required 17% longer to lose equilibrium in elevated CO2. Avoidance of elevated CO2 is therefore independent of animal state, but fish in poor nutritional condition from fasting are more tolerant. Thus, managers considering elevated CO2 as a nonphysical barrier to deter fish movements should be cognizant of food availability, as fasted animals may require increased partial pressures of CO2 to ensure successful deterrence. © 2019 American Fisheries Society",,"avoidance reaction; carbon dioxide; environmental conditions; environmental stress; movement; nutritional status; salmonid; teleost; threshold; Animalia; Micropterus; Micropterus salmoides; Teleostei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068725088

Since the building sector greatly contributes to the use of energy globally, the amelioration of this sector is an urgent issue to contribute to climate stabilization. Published literature shows that green roofs affect both directly and indirectly building energy use, delivering the message that green roofs are fit-all solutions. However, the efficacy of the deployment of green roofs varies depending on climate and on their specific design. The present study contains a geographically explicit review of the potential building energy benefits deriving by the installation of green roofs depending on their specific design aiming at answering to the following research questions: - Are green roofs fit-all solutions for decreasing building energy use in diverse climates? - How insulation, growing media, and plant selection of green roofs should be calibrated in different climates to maximize their effect on building energy use? - How green roofs can contribute to urban heat island-mitigation in different climates? Answering these research-questions, this study provides urban decision-makers and planning agencies useful insights to, not only prioritize strategies, but also efficiently design by-laws and local regulations to maximize the potential positive effect of urban-wide green roof deployment on building energy use. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate mitigation; Energy saving; Green roofs; Urban heat island; Urban policy making; Urban sustainability","Atmospheric temperature; Decision making; Energy conservation; Laws and legislation; Roofs; Climate mitigations; Green roof; Urban heat island; Urban policy; Urban sustainability; Architectural design; climate change; energy efficiency; energy use; heat island; insulation; mitigation; sustainability; urban climate; urban policy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069682398

In this study, we used an IPAT model to design 48 peak CO2 emission scenarios. We used a centralized DEA to evaluate the allocative efficiency of scenario-based CO2 emission paths by maximizing the aggregated potential GDP under fixed emission quantities. We found that maintaining relatively high GDP growth (around 6%), reducing energy intensity by about 75% of average annual decline rate of 2005–2015 (around 4%), and increasing non-fossil energy to 21% to meet the Innovation plan of energy technology revolution 2016–2030 requirements is the most efficient low-carbon behaviors towards 2030 peak CO2 emissions of 10.57 Gt. We also found that China can potentially reduce CO2 emission intensity (CEI)by up to 72.7% compared to the 2005 level in 2030, and therefore that official CEI reduction targets (60–65%)are well within reach.

Context: Precipitation use efficiency (PUE), the ratio of net primary productivity (NPP) to annual precipitation, is one of the key factors that can clarify the response of forest ecosystem carbon and water cycles to ongoing climate change. Aims: To investigate large-scale patterns of NPP and PUE, and to determine how NPP and PUE would respond to climate and soil variables across the North-South Transect forests (TNSTF) of China. Methods: We revealed the spatial pattern dynamics of NPP and PUE in the TNSTF from 2000 to 2010 employing MOD17 NPP data and further explored the responses of NPP and PUE to environment factors across the TNSTF. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of NPP and PUE in different forest types and their dependencies on climate variation were investigated. Results: The results indicated that NPP increased from 2000 to 2010 in most regions across the TNSTF. The spatial distribution pattern of NPP was mainly correlated with climate factors in the TNSTF rather than soil properties. Spatially, an increased trend of PUE (2000–2010) was found in the south and decreased PUE was revealed in the north of the TNSTF. In addition, the spatial distribution of PUE in the TNSTF was associated with both climate and soil factors. For different forests, only the NPP in warm temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests significantly increased (2000–2010, R2 = 0.33, P &lt; 0.05) due to the increase in precipitation (R2 = 0.82, P &lt; 0.0005). Moreover, only the PUE in temperate coniferous broad-leaved mixed forests presented a significantly decreasing trend (2000–2010, R2 = 0.38, P &lt; 0.05), which was significantly negatively correlated with precipitation (R2 = 0.80, P &lt; 0.0005). Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that climate governed the spatial distribution of NPP; in addition to the climate, soil properties also played an important role in shaping the spatial distribution of PUE. Our findings highlight that the dynamics of precipitation rather than those of temperature mediated the variations in NPP and PUE in forests across the TNSTF. © 2019, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","China; Climate; Forest ecosystem; Net primary production; Precipitation use efficiency; The north-south transect","climate change; climate cycle; climate effect; forest ecosystem; hydrological cycle; net primary production; precipitation (climatology); temporal analysis; transect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071954577

The diurnal variation was significant that the lowest TVOC concentrations were observed in the midnight period (28.4 ± 25.6 ppbv) while the highest was shown in the morning (49.6 ± 40.1 ppbv). The differences of total non-methane VOCs (TVOCs) between weekdays and weekend were also significant that the weekend showed significantly high VOC levels than weekdays (p &lt; 0.05) but did not lead to significant ambient O3 increase (p &gt; 0.05). Isopentane, a general marker for vehicle exhaust, showed descending concentrations from morning to midnight and good correlation with vehicle numbers on road, indicating a potential source to the VOCs at this site. The results from PMF proved that vehicular exhaust was the largest source to the VOCs in this study (64.4%). VOC categories showed a reverse sequence in abundance of concentrations and OFP contributions that alkenes showed the highest OFPs although with the lowest abundance in TOVCs due to their high reactivity in photochemical reactions. High OFPs from ethylene and isopentane indicated that vehicular emissions could be the largest potential OFP source in this site. OFPs from isoprene (from 1.85 to 13.4 ppbv) indicated that biogenic VOCs should not be negligible in urban Xi’an city when controlling O3 pollutants. Comparison of two OFP methods was conducted and MIR method was proved to be more reasonable and scientific in summer Xi’an. Therefore, vehicular emission, the largest contributor to ambient VOCs and also OFPs, as well as biological source should be priority controlled in guiding VOC emissions and reducing O3 control policies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","OFP; Source apportionment; Temporal variation; VOC profiles","concentration (composition); emission control; ozone; pollutant source; source apportionment; summer; temporal variation; traffic emission; urban pollution; volatile organic compound; China; Shaanxi; Xian; 1,3 butadiene; hemiterpene; isopentane; isoprene; ozone; pentane; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; chemistry; China; city; exhaust gas; season; Air Pollutants; Butadienes; China; Cities; Hemiterpenes; Ozone; Pentanes; Seasons; Vehicle Emissions; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069529172

However, recent meta-analyses show that local alpha diversity is often stable or slightly increasing [2–4]. Here, we show that the local alpha diversity (species richness) of plants found in quadrats and transects has increased the most in cooler regions of the world that have experienced the highest absolute changes (i.e., changes in either direction) in climate. The greatest statistical support is for the effects of precipitation change. On average, alpha diversity declined slightly (−4.2% per decade) in the third of sites that experienced the lowest precipitation change but increased (+10.8% per decade) in the third of sites with the highest precipitation change. These results suggest that the “perturbation” of local communities during climatic transitions increases the average number of species, at least temporarily, an effect likely to remain important as climate change continues. © 2019 The Author(s)Most biodiversity metrics are declining, but there is no clear trend in local species richness over time.

It is presented in the global, Asia-Pacific regional and Southeast Asian context, where the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable urbanization are in a flux. After the Second World War, Khon Kaen emerged as a regional urban centre due to the Thai government’s anticommunist campaign and it being military base to US camps in the US-Vietnam War. As the city rapidly urbanized, it faced diverse challenges, ranging from an influx of rural migrants to environmental degradation. Today, Khon Kaen’s urban challenges are different. As the economy shifts from manufacturing to services, metropolitan government leaders and their constituents seek to transform Khon Kaen into a smart city with a transit-oriented development strategy. Climate change has also affected the city, causing devastating floods and prolonged droughts. Residents in squatter settlements are highly vulnerable to these climate-induced disasters and are under constant threat of eviction. Informed by the development trajectory outlined above, this city profile starts by laying out the global, Asia-Pacific regional and Southeast Asian context, and then discusses Khon Kaen’s rise to prominence as a regional economic and logistic hub in Thailand’s north-eastern region. The city’s current conditions, such as its geographical, historical, economic, social, environmental and administrative and governance contexts, are considered. Then, contemporary challenges of sustainable urban development are explained. This city profile culminates in a discussion of future development strategies for Khon Kaen as a bellwether secondary city in Thailand. © 2019 National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA).","informal settlements; Secondary city; transit-oriented development; urban climate resilience; urban growth pole","development strategy; informal settlement; regional economy; smart city; sustainable development; urban climate; urban development; urban growth; urban renewal; urbanization; Khon Kaen [Khon Kaen (PRV)]; Khon Kaen [Northeastern Region]; Northeastern Region; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071441788

Recently, real-driving emissions (RDE) test procedures have been introduced in the EU aiming to evaluate nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate number (PN) emissions from passenger cars during on-road operation. Although RDE accounts for a large variety of real-world driving, it excludes certain driving situations by setting boundary conditions (e.g., in relation to altitude, temperature or dynamic driving). The present work investigates the on-road emissions of NOx, NO2, CO, particle number (PN) and CO2 from a fleet of 19 Euro 6b, 6c and 6d-TEMP vehicles, including diesel, gasoline (GDI and PFI) and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. The vehicles were tested under different on-road driving conditions outside boundaries. These included ‘baseline’ tests, but also testing conditions beyond the RDE boundary conditions to investigate the performance of the emissions control devices in demanding situations. Consistently low average emission rates of PN and CO were measured from all diesel vehicles tested under most conditions. Moreover, the tested Euro 6d-TEMP and Euro 6c diesel vehicles met the NOx emission limits applicable to Euro 6d-TEMP diesel vehicles during RDE tests (168 mg/km). The Euro 6b GDI vehicle equipped with a gasoline particulate filter (GPF) presented PN emissions &lt; 6 × 1011 #/km. These results, in contrast with previous on-road measurements from earlier Euro 6 vehicles, indicate more efficient emission control technologies are currently being used in diesel and gasoline vehicles. At the same time, the results suggest that particular attention should be given to CO and PN emissions of certain types of vehicles when driven under dynamic conditions, and possibly additional work is necessary. In particular, the emissions of CO (measured in this study during the regulated RDE test, but without an emission limit associated to it) or PN from PFI vehicles (presently not covered by the Euro 6 standard) showed elevated results in some occasions. Emissions of CO were up to 7.5 times higher when the more dynamic tests were conducted and the highest PN emissions were measured from a PFI gasoline vehicle during dynamic driving. Although based on a limited sample of cars, our work points to the relevance of a technology- and fuel-neutral approach to vehicle emission standards, whereby all vehicles must comply with the same emission limits for all pollutants. © 2019 The Authors","Air pollution; CO; Euro 6; NOx; PN; RDE; Vehicle emissions","carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; gasoline; natural gas; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; atmospheric pollution; boundary condition; carbon monoxide; diesel engine; emission control; equipment; nitric oxide; nitrogen oxides; testing method; traffic emission; air pollution control; air quality; Article; boundary layer; car; car driving; diesel engine; environmental aspects and related phenomena; exhaust gas; highway; particle size; particulate matter; pollution and pollution related phenomena; priority journal; real driving emission test; traffic and transport; air pollutant; air pollution; car; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Automobiles; Gasoline; Motor Vehicles; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069919759

American and Chinese college students and adults were surveyed about their support for signing an international climate treaty including commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, conditional on the other country signing the same treaty or not. This study finds knowledge of other-country non-support on average decreases cooperative behaviour among all age groups in both the US and China. Knowledge of China’s support for the treaty is found on average to increase support among American adults, while having no noticeable effect on average support among American college students. Chinese citizens are found to not respond positively to reciprocity. Although not statistically significant at conventional significance levels, knowledge of the US’s support is found on average to decrease support among Chinese college students and adults. Key policy insights To increase support for international climate treaties, knowledge that another major emitter will sign the treaty does not unanimously increase domestic support. Knowing the other country will not sign the treaty decreases domestic support for signing an international climate treaty for both Americans and Chinese, relative to not being told about the other country’s decision to sign the treaty. Knowing China will sign an international climate treaty on average increases American adult support for signing the same treaty, while American college student support is unaffected. Although not statistically significant at conventional significance levels, knowing the US will sign an international climate treaty on average decreases Chinese support for signing the same treaty.

Methods: We analyzed singleton births ≥27 weeks of gestation from 20-county metropolitan Atlanta with conception dates between January 1, 2002 and February 28, 2006 (N = 273,711). Trimester-specific and total pregnancy average concentrations for 10 pollutants, obtained from ground observations that were interpolated using 12-km Community Multiscale Air Quality model outputs, were assigned using maternal residence at delivery. We estimated associations between interquartile range width (IQRw) increases in pollutant concentrations and changes in birth weight using quantile regression. Results: Gestational age-adjusted associations were of greater magnitude at higher percentiles of the birth weight distribution. Pollutants with large vehicle source contributions (carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, PM2.5 elemental carbon, and total PM2.5 mass), as well as PM2.5 sulfate and PM2.5 ammonium, were associated with birth weight decreases for the higher birth weight percentiles. For example, whereas the decrease in mean birthweight per IQRw increase in PM2.5 averaged over pregnancy was -7.8 g (95% confidence interval = -13.6, -2.0 g), the quantile-specific associations were: 10th percentile -2.4 g (-11.5, 6.7 g); 50th percentile -8.9 g (-15.7, -2.0g); and 90th percentile -19.3 g (-30.6, -7.9 g). Associations for the intermediate and high birth weight quantiles were not sensitive to gestational age adjustment. For some pollutants, we saw associations at the lowest quantile (10th percentile) when not adjusting for gestational age.

As healthy urban trees have proven to be an important mitigation and adaptation tool for climate change as well as a significant provider of ecosystem services, there is a need for planting species and cultivars capable of coping with the limited water supply. However, data on species' and cultivars' response to drought, particularly their water supplying root systems remains rare. To consider the whole plant responses to drought situations, we studied the growth and phenology of three frequently planted tree species and cultivars with a diameter of 5-6 cm during a one-year rainfall exclusion experiment conducted in a nursery field as well as the dry biomass of the compartments branch, stem, and root after excavation. Our results revealed that species' and cultivars' performance were linked to their within-plant carbon partitioning. A high tolerance to drought was noted for Acer campestre, with a particularly high ratio of root:shoot ratio, which made it presumably less susceptible to droughts. Tilia cordata 'Greenspire' was highly affected by the reduced water availability visible through prematurely leaf senescence, while Carpinus betulus 'Fastigiata' suffered from losing a considerable part of its root biomass, which resulted in the lowest root:shoot ratio of all species and cultivars. This study demonstrated the need for investigating the reaction patterns of species and cultivars by considering both the above-and the below-ground plant parts. We recommend that, for future tree plantings at harsh and challenging urban sites, an important selection criterion should be species' and cultivars' capability to develop and retain strong and dense root systems even under limited water supply, as that is believed to be an important trait for drought tolerance. © 2019 by the authors.","Allocation; Drought tolerance; Partitioning; Resistance; Root:shoot ratio","biological development; biomass allocation; climate change; cultivar; deciduous tree; drought; ecosystem service; growth rate; morphology; phenology; rainfall; roadside environment; root-shoot ratio; senescence; tolerance; tree planting; urban area; water availability; Acer campestre; Carpinus betulus; Tilia cordata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072625239

Residues are also in demand in sectors coupled to crop production, such as the supply chain of livestock and bioenergy production. Ongoing debate revolves around balancing these competing uses, but science-based assessments of the long-term sustainability of residue exploitation are rare. This work uses biophysical simulation modelling to explore the likely response of SOC to different management strategies, using the land area of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) as a case study. Four strategies are tested: zero, one third and 100% removal of cereal residues, plus an approach proposed by the State farm advisory service. Simulations are carried out for the period 1971-2050 and 19 crop rotations coincident with land use throughout the study area. Uncertainty associated with the modelled SOC changes is explored by sampling values of relevant parameters for SOC turnover and running an ensemble of model configurations. Simulated SOC is used to trace time-dependent response functions following a change in residue management under different soil textures, initial SOC levels and crop rotations. Results highlight a general exponential decrease in SOC, with relative changes in 2050 distributed between +10% and -40% with respect to a reference period. SOC loss can be buffered or offset by returning all crop residues to the soil. Under such management, an SOC increase can be achieved on clayey soils characterized by a low initial SOC. Under moderate crop residue removal, positive SOC trends are limited to a few crop rotations. In this context, 4 per 1000 increase rate in SOC appears largely out of reach through residue management, calling for additional measures to meet the targets of land-based mitigation of anthropogenic emissions. © 2019 The Author(s).

In this paper, we test the impact heating hypothesis for warming early Mars as presented in Segura et al. (2008)using a new early Mars version of the NASA Ames Research Center 3-D Mars Global Climate Model. We simulate impacts of asteroids 30-, 50-, and 100- km in diameter into atmospheres possessing 150-mbar, 1-bar, and 2-bar surface pressure conditions, accounting for both radiatively active and radiatively inert water clouds. Based on the scenarios simulated here, we find that the evolution of post-impact initially hot and moist conditions can be characterized in four phases: 1)a rapid radiative cooling phase, 2)a latent heat phase in which cloud formation and the radiative effects of water vapor induce a temporary warm period with significant precipitation, 3)a transition phase in which cooling accelerates due to sublimation at the surface and the lack of available water in the atmosphere for greenhouse warming and in which water vapor begins to contribute less to surface warming than water clouds, and 4)a steady state phase with mean annual surface temperatures below freezing and minimal precipitation. In these post-impact climate scenarios, global average surface temperatures remain above freezing for only 0.043 to 6.25 Mars years, accompanied by 0.23 to 5.8 m of cumulative precipitation (global equivalent)falls during 10 simulated Mars years. Ultimately, periods of warm temperatures and significant precipitation are short-lived and even in the warmest cases, do not support sustained conditions in which valley networks are likely to form in the long run either by liquid precipitation or by seasonal melting of surface ice. Scenarios with high surface pressures and radiatively active clouds experience the longest periods of above-freezing post-impact temperatures and result in the highest mean annual temperatures during the fourth phase (272.8 K in our warmest scenario), highlighting the potential significance of water clouds in the early Martian climate and the importance of their careful physical treatment in models. Future studies addressing sustained warm and wet early Mars conditions should investigate the potential effects of obliquity, initial surface ice distribution, and possible delivery of reducing greenhouse gases on these post-impact climates. © 2019 The Authors","Impact processes; Mars, atmosphere; Mars, climate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065161894

The complete process is carried out in three main reactors, in which the reactions occurring are the dry and steam reforming of natural gas with H2O and CO2, the oxidation of the oxygen carrier (OC) with air and the reduction with a low-grade fuel such as plant off-gases. The thermal balance of the process is achieved by combining the endothermic reforming reaction with the exothermic chemical looping combustion. The chemical looping based process is fully integrated with the separation and synthesis units as well as the power and heat utilities of the two large scale production plants. The two plants are compared with state-of-the-art technologies, including the benchmarks for hydrogen and methanol production from natural gas through steam reforming and auto-thermal reforming. Compared to a conventional H2 production plant (without CO2 capture), the reforming efficiency is 3% higher, while the required primary energy consumption to separate CO2 is 0.47 MJLHV/kgCO2 which is significantly lower than that of an amine-based plant (&gt;1.35 MJLHV/kgCO2) and the cost of hydrogen production with the proposed process is 2.19 $/kg with a CO2 avoidance cost of 58.7 $/tonCO2 (compared to &gt; 70.6 $/tonCO2 for solvent based plant). In case of methanol production, the carbon conversion is comparable with the best available processes even though CO2 purification and separation (98% capture with &gt;96% purity) units are included due to the improved energy recovery. By using chemical looping the cost of methanol production decreases overall by 17% compared to the benchmark plant due to the lower investment cost and higher electricity generation resulting overall in a negative CO2 avoidance cost (-303 $/tonCO2). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CCUS; chemical looping; energy analysis; hydrogen; methanol; packed bed","Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Chemical reactors; Combustion; Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Gas plants; Hydrogen; Investments; Methanol; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Packed beds; Separation; Steam reforming; CCUS; Chemical looping; Chemical looping combustion; Endothermic reforming reaction; Energy analysis; Primary energy consumption; State-of-the-art technology; Techno-economic assessment; Hydrogen production; assessment method; carbon sequestration; energy use; high pressure; hydrogen; methanol; natural gas; purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066440456

This paper conducts a whole systems energy justice analysis of four European low-carbon transitions—nuclear power in France, smart meters in Great Britain, electric vehicles in Norway, and solar photovoltaic panels in Germany. It asks: in what ways may each of these transitions result in injustices that extend beyond communities and countries, i.e., across the whole system? It utilizes a mixed-methods research design based on 64 semi-structured research interviews with experts across all four transitions, five public focus groups, and the collection of 58 comments from twelve public internet forums to answer this question. Drawing inductively from these data, the paper identifies and analyzes 44 injustices spread across three spatial scales. Micro scale injustices concern immediate local impacts on family livelihood, community health and the environment. Meso scale injustices include national-scale issues such as rising prices for electricity and gas or unequal access to low-carbon technology. Macro scale injustices include global issues such as the extraction of minerals and metals and the circulation of waste flows. The paper then discusses these collective injustices in terms of their spatiality and temporality, before offering conclusions for energy and climate research and policy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate policy; Energy justice; Energy policy; Energy transitions; Whole systems","energy policy; environmental impact; environmental policy; questionnaire survey; spatiotemporal analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070905456

As a signatory nation of the Paris Agreement, Brazil has made a climate action commitment, and expressed its nationally determined contribution to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 37%. The Brazilian population is highly urban, and Brazilian cities are mostly responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, and the worst effects of global warming are experienced in cities. Hence, the fulfillment of the Brazilian climate commitments depends on the active engagement of municipalities. Nevertheless, the Brazilian national government does not monitor local climate actions, and it is not clear how local urban policy is aligned with climate action. In order to bridge this gap, this study tackles the question of: “Are, and if yes how, cities considering the climate emergency in their local planning mechanisms?” This question is investigated by placing five major Brazilian cities under the microscope. The methodological approach includes literature review and applied qualitative analysis to scrutinize how climate issues and actions are factored in urban planning regulations to verify if and to what extent local policies contribute to the fulfillment of the Brazilian nationally determined contribution, and sustainable development goals. The results disclose that investigated cities have adequately incorporated climatic issues in their urban planning mechanisms. However, policy concentrates more on adaptation rather than mitigation, and policy implementation yet to be realized. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Climate crisis; Climate emergency; Disasters; Global warming; Smart cities; Sustainable development goals; Sustainable urban development; Urban health; Urban policy","Climate change; Disasters; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Smart city; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Climate crisis; Climate emergency; Sustainable urban development; Urban health; Urban policy; Environmental protection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071904488

The goal of this study was to investigate the diversity, abundance, and dynamics of microbial communities in impacted groundwater and correlate them to the corresponding land use and groundwater geochemistry, using an Illumina MiSeq platform targeting the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. The resulting MiSeq sequencing revealed the co-occurrence patterns of both abundant and rare microbial taxa within an impacted groundwater basin. Proteobacteria were the most common groundwater-associated bacterial phylum, mainly composed of the classes Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria. The phyla detected at less abundances were the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, OD1, and Nitrospirae. The members of detected groundwater microorganisms involved in natural biogeochemical processes such as nitrification, anammox, methane oxidation, sulfate reduction, and arsenic transformation. Some of the detected microorganisms were able to perform anaerobic degradation of organic pollutants. The resulting PCA indicates that major land usage within the sampling area seemed to be significantly linked to the groundwater microbial distributions.

In this study, a novel integrated gravitational-flow wastewater treatment system (IGWTS) for treating domestic wastewater in rural areas was developed and evaluated. As the core module of IGWTS, the multi-soil-layering (MSL) system showed good performances for removing organic matters and nutrients in lab-scale experiments. Aeration was found to be the dominant positive factor for contaminant removal in factorial analysis, while bottom submersion had the most negative effect. Based on the critical operational factors obtained from lab-scale tests, the full-scale IGWTS consisting of multifunctional anaerobic tank (MFAT), MSL, and subsurface flow constructed wetland (SFCW) was designed, constructed, and operated successfully in the field application. The final effluent concentrations of COD, BOD5, TP, NH3-N, and TN reached 22.0, 8.0, 0.3, 4.0, and 11.0 mg/L, with removal rates of 92, 93, 92, 86, and 76%, respectively. The feasibility of IGWTS was also quantitatively evaluated from the perspectives of resource consumption, economic costs, water environment impact, and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. IGWTS has been proved to be a sound approach to mitigate GHG emissions compared with centralized wastewater treatment plant. It can also be featured as an eco-friendly technology to improve rural water environment, and an economic scenario with low construction and operation costs.

Supplementing remote sensing device (RSD) equipment with additional equipment increased the capture rate by almost 10%. Post-processing of raw data is essential to obtain useful and accurate information. A method is presented to identify vehicles with excessive emission levels (high emitters). First, an anomaly detection method is applied, followed by identification of cold start operating conditions using infrared vehicle profiles. Using this method, 0.6% of the vehicles in the full (enhanced) RSD data were identified as high emitters, of which 35% are likely in cold start mode where emissions typically stabilize to low hot running emission levels within a few minutes. Analysis of NOx RSD data confirms that poor real-world NOx performance of Euro 4/5 light-duty diesel vehicles observed around the world is also evident in Australian measurements. This research suggests that the continued dieselisation in Australia, in particular under the current Euro 5 emission standards and the more stringent NO2 air quality criteria expected in 2020 and 2025, could potentially result in local air quality issues near busy roads. © 2019 by the authors.","Cold start; Emissions; High emitter; Motor vehicle; NO2; NOx; On-road; Remote sensing; Road traffic","Air quality; Anomaly detection; Data handling; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Roads and streets; Vehicles; Cold start; High emitter; Motor vehicle; On-road; Road traffic; Remote sensing; air quality; data processing; nitrogen dioxide; remote sensing; road traffic; traffic emission; transport vehicle; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072264905

However, previous research emphasizes the lack of existing tools to support the decision-making process at the early design stage, characterized by a low level of project details. This paper presents a comparison between three LCA tools. The first, stemming from a research and development project (SETUP), is an exploration tool relying on a database of urban-level scenarios and their environmental performance, able to convert district targets (e.g. 2000-Watt society objectives) into specific sub-targets at the building or component levels. The other two are online LCA tools currently available to practitioners (Sméo and Calculation tool for 2000-Watt-society-sites RH II ), that allow assessing the project and verifying its compliance with a given target. Each tool was applied to a low-carbon case study, the blueFactory district in Fribourg (Switzerland), in two hypothetical contexts corresponding to the schematic and detailed project development phases, characterized by different levels of details. When used for the assessment of a project at a more advanced development stage with a high resolution of detail, findings indicate that Smeo and RH II provide similar environmental performance results. However, in early planning stages, SETUP shows better abilities to support decision-making by providing ranges of results and highlighting uncertainties and the influence of design parameters that have not yet been fixed. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

China, given its large CO2 footprint and strong dependence on coal, is a particularly important player. In this study, we show a pathway for affordable deployment of CO2 capture in the Chinese power sector scaling to greater than 100 million tCO2 per year by 2030 at an avoided cost of less than $37/tCO2. We show that the distribution of costs across a fleet of power plants presents an underappreciated opportunity to reduce costs and that several avenues are available in the existing policy and market regime to further reduce the net avoided cost of capture to as low as $25/tCO2 for some plants. This means the rate of deployment of CCS in China will likely be limited by the maturation of transport and storage, rather than the cost of capture. Given the urgency called for in the recent IPCC 1.5DC report, it is believed that CCS needs to be deployed at larger scale and earlier than generally believed because it could significantly improve the range and affordability of options available to address how the energy ecosystem might evolve in a carbon-constrained future. Previous research holds that CCS is currently too expensive to implement. This study shows the costs can be significantly lower in China to a surprising degree. This is primarily driven by the fact that actual plant parameters are different from reference plant parameters. While a breakthrough would be valuable, our manuscript shows that there are other more impactful factors, such as internal coal pricing, accounting for depreciation of retrofit technologies, breakeven cost basis, priority dispatch for clean power generators, and engineering learning curve and technology development, that can be brought to bear immediately, so the world can get started on CCS now. In this study, using a granular analysis of the existing power plant fleet at Shenhua Group, a large power company, we show that local variations in power plant type, operation, geographical location, age, and fuel costs result in significant distribution in the avoided cost of CO2 capture within a single fleet. The fleet analysis initiated in this study is required to estimate the distribution of CO2 capture costs. The strategy addresses the concerns that currently CCS is universally expensive. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","carbon capture; CCS; China; fleet analysis; power plant; techno-economics","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost engineering; Costs; Economics; Electric utilities; Engineering education; Fleet operations; Power plants; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); China; Engineering learning; fleet analysis; Geographical locations; Strong dependences; Techno-economics; Technology development; Cost benefit analysis; carbon sequestration; economic analysis; environmental economics; environmental planning; environmental policy; power plant; technology adoption; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072188763

The role of these events in governing the biotic exchange between Southeast Asia and Indian subregion is underexplored. We aimed to uncover the effects the collision of the Indian and Asian plate, marine transgression in the Bengal basin as well as the paleoclimatic changes in the subcontinent and adjoining regions, on the dispersal of freshwater snail family Viviparidae from Southeast Asia (SEA) to Indian subregion. Extensive sampling was carried out throughout the Indian subcontinent to capture the current diversity of the targeted lineages. Three mitochondrial and two nuclear markers were sequenced from these samples and combined with published sequences to reconstruct global phylogeny of Viviparidae. Molecular dating and ancestral range estimation were undertaken to obtain the time frame for the dispersal events. Results from these analyses were contrasted with paleoclimate and paleogeology to better understand the biogeography of Indian viviparids. Results support at least two dispersal events into India from Southeast Asia. The earlier event is likely to have occurred during a warm and humid Eocene period before a permanent land connection was established between the two landmasses. While the more recent dispersal occurred post-suturing and overlapped with a time in late Tertiary to Quaternary when arid climate prevailed. However, we could not firmly establish how the marine transgressions influenced the dispersal events. Even though most biotic exchange between India and SEA are noted to be post-suturing, our results add to a growing body of work that suggests faunal exchange pre-suturing probably mediated by intermittent land connections. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Aridification; Dispersal; India-Asia collision; Into-India; Marine transgression; Viviparidae","fresh water; animal; Bayes theorem; climate change; geography; India; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; physiology; population migration; snail; species difference; statistical model; Animal Migration; Animals; Base Sequence; Bayes Theorem; Climate Change; Fresh Water; Geography; India; Likelihood Functions; Phylogeny; Snails; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066755559

In light of that, the state of the production for these wastes in different parts of the globe was first presented. Subsequently, various waste-to-energy technologies and their electricity generation feasibility from both environmental and economic perspectives were reviewed. Finally, electricity generation and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potentials through anaerobic digestion of the above-mentioned wastes generated in each province of Iran in 2016 were investigated as a case study. Accordingly, Khuzestan province with the highest amount of agro-wastes (7.61 million tons) and Sistan and Baluchestan province with the highest amount of livestock/slaughterhouse wastes (10.69 million tons) had the maximum electricity generation potentials of 82.83 MW and 164.23 MW, respectively. Moreover, the country's total potentials for electricity generation from these wastes was determined at 2848.26 MW. Based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) results, a minimum of 10,693.5 thousand tons CO2eq/yr could be avoided by valorizing these wastes into electricity in Iran. This would be translated into 1.5% reduction of Iran's annual GHG emissions; a promising achievement given Iran's international GHGs reduction commitment. Moreover, if a short-term time horizon would be considered for electricity generation from these wastes, the reduction rate could reach 24,153 thousand tons CO2eq/yr, i.e., 3.39% reduction of Iran's annual GHG emissions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report scrutinizing electricity generation potentials from both agricultural and livestock/slaughterhouse wastes in Iran while assessing the consequent GHG emission reduction potentials. The outcomes of the study could assist policy makers with decisions aimed at taking advantage of these resources while the platform introduced pave the way for other researchers to conduct similar studies in different parts of the world. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural waste; Consequential LCA; Global warming contribution; Life cycle assessment; Livestock/slaughterhouse wastes; Waste management","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Emission control; Environmental technology; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Waste management; Consequential LCA; Economic perspective; Electricity generation; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Khuzestan provinces; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Reduction potential; Waste to energy technologies; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066265120

The 18-kDa translocator protein TSPO is used as an imaging target in positron emission tomography to detect neuroinflammation, and its expression is correlated with microglial activation. However, the mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of Tspo induced by inflammation is not clear. Here, we revealed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced Tspo expression was activated by the AP-1 complex in a mouse microglial cell line, BV-2. Knockdown of c-Fos and c-Jun, the components of AP-1, reduced LPS-induced Tspo expression. Furthermore, the enrichment of Sp1 in the proximal promoter region of Tspo was increased in the presence of LPS. In addition, the binding of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the enhancer region, which contains the AP-1 site, was decreased by LPS treatment, but there were no significant differences in HDAC1 binding to the proximal promoter region with or without LPS. These results indicated that HDAC1 is involved not in the proximal promoter region but in the enhancer region. Our study revealed that inflammatory signals induce the recruitment of AP-1 to the enhancer region and Sp1 to the proximal promoter region of the Tspo gene and that Sp1 May regulate the basal expression of Tspo. © 2019 Shimoyama et al.

Thus, revealing the determinants of household CO2 emissions (HCE) is extremely important for national efforts towards emissions mitigation. In this context, this paper investigates the driving forces behind national and regional HCE changes employing a temporal Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model. It also analyses interregional discrepancies in HCE using a spatial LMDI model. This study decomposes the changes or discrepancies of national and regional HCE from 2000 to 2015 into seven key factors. The temporal analysis indicates that household income is the predominant determinant explaining the increase of HCE, whereas energy intensity is the crucial determinant contributing to the mitigation of HCE. The spatial analysis reveals that the number of households and energy intensity are primary driving forces accountable for growing discrepancies in HCE, followed by household income, energy structure and carbon emission coefficient. The analysis also suggests that resourceful and economically developed regions generally have larger potential for mitigation of HCE. The study concludes with some policy recommendations based on the results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; CO2 emissions; Decomposition analysis; Household sector","Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Carbon dioxide emissions; China; CO2 emissions; Decomposition analysis; Emissions mitigation; Household sectors; Policy recommendations; Temporal and spatial; Spatial variables measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067272743

In this study, we employ the MLR and GWR modelling method to obtain estimation models for PM2.5 with a set of land use/landscape metrics as predictor variables. The study focused on investigating the influence of urban land use and landscape pattern on PM2.5 spatial variation, specifically, on identification of influential landscape classes/types that regulate PM2.5 concentration levels. The spatial PM2.5 concentration in the compact urban scenario of Hong Kong was sampled by conducting a series of mobile monitoring campaigns. The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) Scheme and World Urban Database and Portal Tools (WUDAPT) level 0 database were adopted as the basis of the calculation of land use/landscape metrics. These metrics were then adopted as the predictors to explain the spatial variations in PM2.5. 62% of the variance in PM2.5 can be explained by the resultant GWR model using only five land use/landscape classes, and without using any traffic-related variables or data from emission inventory. The findings can inform the urban planning strategies for mitigating air pollution and also indicate the usefulness of LCZ and WUDAPT in estimating the spatial variation of urban air quality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Land use; Landscape pattern; Mobile monitoring; WUDAPT","Air pollution; Air quality; Aerodynamic diameters; Emission inventories; Landscape pattern; Mobile monitoring; PM2.5 concentration; Predictor variables; Urban Planning Strategies; WUDAPT; Land use; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; land use change; landscape; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; spatial variation; urban planning; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064381577

Here, we combined multisource data and econometric models to quantify the relationships between urban forms and PM2.5 concentration in 250 Chinese cities, with explicit consideration of urban area size, population size, economic structure, and geographical location. The results showed that urban expansion had significant positive impacts on PM2.5 concentration in medium-sized (50–150 km2) and very large-sized cities (&gt;250 km2). Urban form compactness tended to be beneficial for the reduction in PM2.5 concentration in large cities (5 million &lt; population &lt; 10 million). The urban form-PM2.5 concentration relationships were also dominated by economic structure change. That is, urban form irregularity/compactness played an important role in PM2.5 concentration within second cities (the proportion of second industry &gt; 50%) and other cities compared to third cities (the proportion of third industry &gt; 50%). Moreover, a compact and connected urban form was found to be more beneficial for reducing PM2.5 emissions in the northern region than in other regions. This study illustrates that the urban form-PM2.5 concentration relationships are sensitive to the differences in urban types and suggests that flexible urban planning strategies can actually help to reduce PM2.5 concentration in Chinese cities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Fine particulate concentration; Multi-perspective analysis; Urban forms","Economics; Population statistics; Structure (composition); China; Fine particulates; Geographical locations; Multi-perspective; PM2.5 concentration; Rapid urbanizations; Urban form; Urban Planning Strategies; Urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067018059

The network addresses significant data gaps in a region where mercury emission estimates are the highest globally, and available measurement data are limited. The reduction of mercury emissions under the Minamata Convention on Mercury also justifies the need for continent-wide and consistent observations that can help determine the magnitude of the problem and assess the efficacy of reductions over time. The APMMN's primary objectives are to monitor wet deposition and atmospheric concentrations of mercury and assist partners in developing their own monitoring capabilities. Network planning began in 2012 with wet deposition sampling starting in 2014. Currently, eight network sites measure mercury in precipitation following standardized procedures adapted from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program. The network also has a common regional analytical laboratory (Taiwan), and quality assurance and data flagging procedures, which ensure the network makes scientifically valid and consistent measurements. Results from our ongoing analytical and field quality assurance measurements show minimal contamination in the network and accurate analytical analyses. We are continuing to monitor a potential concentration and precipitation volume bias under certain conditions. The average mercury concentration in precipitation was 11.3 (+9.6) ng L-1 for 139 network samples in 2018. Concentrations for individual sites vary widely. Low averages compare to the low concentrations observed on the U.S.West Coast; while other sites have average concentrations similar to the high values reported from many urban areas in China. Future APMMN goals are to (1) foster new network partnerships, (2) continue to collect, quality assure, and distribute results on the APMMN website, (3) provide training and share best monitoring practices, and (4) establish a gaseous concentration network for estimating dry deposition. © 2019 by the authors.","APMMN; Asia; Mercury; Network; Wet deposition","Deposition; Laboratories; Mercury (metal); Meteorological problems; Networks (circuits); Quality assurance; Analytical laboratories; APMMN; Asia; Atmospheric concentration; Mercury concentrations; Monitoring capabilities; National atmospheric deposition programs; Wet deposition; Urban growth; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); dry deposition; emission inventory; mercury (element); pollutant transport; pollution monitoring; precipitation (climatology); wet deposition; Asia; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (West); Pacific Rim; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072245230

Particularly, for the Yangtze River urban agglomeration, additive model (AM model) is applied to calculate the energy-environmental efficiency, and the convergence model is employed to analyze the heterogeneity and spatial evolution of energy-environmental efficiency. From the results, the energy-environmental efficiency for Suzhou is at a good level; the figures for Wuxi, Yangzhou, and Nantong maintain at medium level; for Zhenjiang, qualified level; and for Nanjing, Changzhou, and Taizhou, poor level. The energy-environmental efficiency of the whole Yangtze River urban agglomeration displays a downward trend of fluctuations. While Nantong reveals a divergent energy-environmental efficiency, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Yangzhou, and Nanjing Cities generally show a trend of convergence. It was also recognized that the energy-environmental efficiency is gradually decreasing from Southeast to North to Southwest regions.

Exposure to traffic-related PM2.5 indoors has received considerable attention as people spend about 80% of their time in indoor environments, but little information is currently available on the assessment and mitigation of this exposure. A systematic field study was conducted with the key objective to assess and mitigate indoor human exposure to traffic-related PM2.5 in a typical naturally ventilated residential apartment. Results indicated that traffic-related PM2.5 levels indoors exceeded the air quality guidelines (12 μg/m3), and the PM2.5 levels decreased significantly (74%)while using an indoor air cleaner. The human health risk assessment based on the bioavailable fraction of toxic trace elements revealed a substantial reduction in potential health risk while using the air cleaner. Overall, the major outcomes of this study would help develop effective air pollution control strategies to reduce indoor human exposure to PM2.5 and potential human health risk caused by vehicular pollution in urban areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air cleaner; Bioavailable toxic trace elements; Fine particulate matter; Potential carcinogenic health risk; Vehicular emissions","Air pollution control; Air quality; Apartment houses; Health; Health risks; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Risk assessment; Trace elements; Bioavailable fraction; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Human health risk assessment; Potential health risks; Substantial reduction; Toxic trace elements; Vehicular emission; Air cleaners; trace element; air quality; bioavailability; carcinogen; ecotoxicology; electronic equipment; health risk; indoor air; particle size; particulate matter; pollution exposure; risk assessment; trace element; traffic emission; air conditioning; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; Article; environmental exposure; gravimetry; health hazard; human; particulate matter; priority journal; residential home; traffic pollution; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066279795

This study was performed to examine the effects of wood pellet (WP) particle size, environmental conditions (stoichiometric ratio; SR), and blending ratio on the combustion characteristics of single fuels and blends using a thermogravimetric analyzer and drop tube furnace (DTF). The results indicate that WP demonstrated a higher mass reduction in the devolatilization region and a faster reaction rate compared with coal. Blends tested in the analyzer showed the expected profiles for devolatilization and char oxidation without the presence of non-additive effects. However, the DTF results showed that simultaneous reactive and non-reactive phenomena occurred with increasing biomass-blending ratios. When WP fuel containing fine particles (< 200 μm) was blended with coal under low SR conditions, early-stage oxygen deficiency was caused by rapid combustion. WP fuel containing coarse particles (> 600 μm) showed that unburned carbon (UBC) increased owing to slower reactivity. WP fuel containing particles of 400 μm or less in size demonstrated superior UBC performance, indicating that biomass-coal blends were significantly affected by blending ratio, particle size, and the surrounding environment. © 2019, KSME & Springer.","Biomass blending ratio; Particle size; Reactivity; Stoichiometric ratio; Wood pellet","Biomass; Blending; Carbon; Climate change; Coal; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Particle size; Pelletizing; Reactivity (nuclear); Wood fuels; Biomass-coal blends; Blending ratio; Combustion characteristics; Environmental conditions; Stoichiometric ratio; Surrounding environment; Thermogravimetric analyzers; Wood pellet; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072075205

This is a particular concern for dense spaces like college campuses that facilitate a growing student population and for parking complexes dedicated to expanding organizations like commercial companies and military facilities. Mass transit solutions must evolve by incorporating new technology to leverage autonomy and reduce carbon footprints while simultaneously incentivizing travelers to increase their use. We present an extension of our previous smart parking and Autonomous Vehicle tasking work by integrating the two with a vehicle advanced warning system based on Bluetooth technology and a self forming mesh network. By detecting and authenticating vehicles bound for parking lots prior to their arrival, we can transact with an AV route planning and tasking system earlier than a vehicle's arrival at the parking facility, thereby reducing traveler wait times at the transfer point to an AV. Consequently, our system encourages parking in more remote lower traffic areas, thereby reducing localized problematic traffic congestion when coupled with maximal occupancy of automated shuttles. We deployed our Bluetooth sensor nodes to an off-site parking lot on George Mason University's Fairfax Campus, and conducted feasibility experiments to explore our proof-of-concept. We also outline a constraint-based shuttle assignment algorithm that minimizes traveler wait times while maintaining consistent AV service. By utilizing systems like these, densely utilized spaces such as college campuses, are enabled with new technology for combating traffic without significant cost. © 2019 IEEE.","Autonomous Vehicles; Bluetooth; On-Demand Dispatching; Smart Parking","Automation; Bluetooth; Carbon footprint; Sensor nodes; Students; Traffic congestion; Assignment algorithms; Bluetooth technology; Feasibility experiments; George Mason University; Military facilities; On demands; Smart parking; Student populations; Autonomous vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075121083

However, the extent to which changes in farm management systems could alter resistance and resilience is largely unknown, especially in response to climate change. Plant and soil microbial community interactions are a vital component of functioning and resilient agroecosystems. The aim of our study was to use winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) plant–soil feedbacks (i.e. plant species-specific effects on soil biota and their impacts on subsequent plant growth) as a metric of system resilience and resistance to climate variability in three different farming management systems: 1) a chemical no-till system, 2) an USDA-certified organic system reliant on tillage and 3) an USDA-certified organic system that included sheep grazing with the overall goal of minimizing tillage intensity. Climate conditions soil experienced were ambient, warmer, and warmer and drier and were manipulated in the field using open-top chamber and rain-out shelters. Plant–soil feedbacks were negative for wheat and positive for pea but varied among farming management systems but were less sensitive to climate conditions. Plant–soil feedbacks were lower in magnitude in the tilled organic system indicating more resistance to the accumulation of pathogenic soil microbiota resulting from repeated cropping of wheat. However, recovery was lower when the crop was pea in the tilled organic indicating slower recovery and less resilience. Results indicate that while increases in crop diversity may promote more resilient agroecosystems, farming management will affect agroecosystem resilience. © 2019 Gesellschaft für Ökologie","Climate change; No-till; Organic; Pisum sativum; Triticum aestivum",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069548228

Relative maturity of this method has been achieved thanks to recent standardization efforts, although there are still several challenges, particularly in the minerals industry where LCA still needs to be strengthened and extended in use. An exhaustive review of recent LCA studies on mining and mineral processing operations was conducted to identify how these have dealt with various methodological challenges. A total of twenty-nine studies were found, most of which focusing on developed regions and in three commodities: coal (28%), aggregates (21%), and copper ores (14%). The source of data for background processes has been the Ecoinvent database in 45% of the studies analyzed, whereas the SimaPro software has been the preferred LCA tool in 66% of such studies. Although important advances have been made, significant issues remain. For instance, inconsistencies were found in the definition of the functional unit and system boundaries (temporal and technological). Further, the adoption of allocation criteria and the use of normalization and weighting in impact assessment have not been considered in most cases. While climate change was the main environmental hotspot (more than 90% of the studies addressed this impact category), the impacts associated with water use and waste management have been overlooked in most studies. Furthermore, mining and processing operations have been described as generic, averaged values or as simple functional relationships between system inputs and outputs using parameters without physical significance (“black box models”) in several production chains, making it difficult to identify opportunities for environmental sustainability enhancement within the sector. The work then discusses the opportunity of improvement in LCA in the minerals industry through the incorporation of process simulation from a bottom-up perspective. Evidence from other industries and recent advances in the computational development of such tools for the mineral sector are reviewed, which suggests that there is an opportunity for reducing the epistemic uncertainty in future LCA studies of mining and processing operations through the combination of both approaches. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Environmental sustainability; Life cycle assessment; Mineral processing; Mining; Process simulation","Climate change; Environmental impact; Mining; Ores; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Waste management; Circular economy; Environmental sustainability; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mineral processing; Process simulations; Life cycle",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066759926

Air pollution is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the relationship between prenatal air pollution exposure and NICU admission has not been investigated. Methods: In the Consortium on Safe Labor (2002–2008), 27,189 singletons were admitted to the NICU. Modified Community Multiscale Air Quality models estimated exposures for criteria air pollutants and constituents of particles less than or equal to 2.5 microns (PM2.5). Case-crossover analyses calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for interquartile range increases in pollutant exposure, comparing exposures during the week of delivery to control periods before and after delivery. Results: In models that adjusted for PM2.5, exposure to PM2.5 constituents during the week before delivery was significantly associated with increased odds of NICU admission: elemental carbon (35%), ammonium ions (37%), nitrate compounds (16%), organic compounds (147%), and sulfate compounds (35%). Odds were also significantly increased by day of and day before delivery exposures to carbon monoxide (4%–5%), nitrogen dioxide (13%), nitrogen oxides (4%–8%), particles less than or equal to 10 microns (2%), particles less than or equal to 2.5 microns (2%), and sulfur dioxide (3%–6%). No associations were observed for ozone. Conclusions: Acute exposures to PM2.5 constituents and several traffic-related pollutants during the week before delivery, the day of delivery, and day before delivery appear to increase the odds of NICU admissions.

Community-based monitoring (CBM) of REDD+ projects could contribute to meeting REDD+ monitoring, reporting, and verification requirements and to ensuring effective community participation. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is the most advanced country in REDD+ implementation in the Congo Basin region, but the role of forest communities in REDD+ monitoring has not been adequately defined. Based on a Delphi survey, this study aimed to explore the factors that are crucial in achieving effective community participation in the monitoring of REDD+ projects. Out of 65 experts with in-depth knowledge of REDD+ and CBM in the DRC and elsewhere, 35 agreed to participate in the study. In three rounds, 19 feedbacks were received from the first round, 17 from the second and 14 from the third. Data were analyzed in a qualitative (MAXQDA) and quantitative (Microsoft Excel) manner. There was consensus among experts that, per definition, effective participation of communities in the monitoring of REDD+ projects must be a process characterized by a free and prior informed consent (FPIC), recognition of traditional knowledge and community rights, and involvement of communities in all steps of the monitoring process. In practice, the latter point poses several challenges as it requires capacity building, careful selection of indicators, adequate local institutional arrangements and a benefit-sharing system. Ideally, local CBM systems should be nested within the national forest monitoring system, but this will require more strategic efforts at the national level in the DRC, including a framework concept for the role of communities and CBM in REDD+ that can be further adapted to particular circumstances on the ground. © 2019 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Carbon; Community-based monitoring; Delphi study; Forest; Livelihoods","Biodiversity; Carbon; Deforestation; Developing countries; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Community participation; Community-based monitoring; DELPHI study; Democratic Republic of Congo; Forest; Institutional arrangement; Livelihoods; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Monitoring; biodiversity; carbon; deforestation; forest management; local participation; participatory approach; Biodiversity; Carbon; Deforestation; Developing Countries; Environmental Regulations; Democratic Republic Congo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072567074

In upland soils, denitrification occurs in hotspots of enhanced microbial activity, even under well-aerated conditions, and causes harmful emissions of nitric (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The timing and magnitude of such emissions are difficult to predict due to the delicate balance of oxygen (O2) consumption and diffusion in soil. To study how spatial distribution of hotspots affects O2 exchange and denitrification, we embedded microbial hotspots composed of porous glass beads saturated with growing cultures of either Agrobacterium tumefaciens (a denitrifier lacking N2O reductase) or Paracoccus denitrificans (a ""complete"" denitrifier) in different architectures (random vs. layered) in sterile sand that was adjusted to different water saturations (30 %, 60 %, 90 %). Gas kinetics (O2, CO2, NO, N2O and N2) were measured at high temporal resolution in batch mode. Air connectivity, air distance and air tortuosity were determined by X-ray tomography after the experiment. The hotspot architecture exerted strong control on microbial growth and timing of denitrification at low and intermediate saturations, because the separation distance between the microbial hotspots governed local oxygen supply. Electron flow diverted to denitrification in anoxic hotspot centers was low (2 %-7 %) but increased markedly (17 %-27 %) at high water saturation. X-ray analysis revealed that the air phase around most of the hotspots remained connected to the headspace even at 90%saturation, suggesting that the threshold response of denitrification to soil moisture could be ascribed to increasing tortuosity of air-filled pores and the distance from the saturated hotspots to these air-filled pores. Our findings suggest that denitrification and its gaseous product stoichiometry depend not only on the amount of microbial hotspots in aerated soil, but also on their spatial distribution. We demonstrate that combining measurements of microbial activity with quantitative analysis of diffusion lengths using X-ray tomography provides unprecedented insights into physical constraints regulating soil microbial respiration in general and denitrification in particular. This paves the way to using observable soil structural attributes to predict denitrification and to parameterize models. Further experiments with natural soil structure, carbon substrates and microbial communities are required to devise and parametrize denitrification models explicit for microbial hotspots. © Author(s) 2019.",,"anoxic conditions; bacterium; denitrification; growth; microbial activity; nitrous oxide; respiration; soil moisture; soil respiration; spatial distribution; Agrobacterium tumefaciens; Paracoccus denitrificans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072755436

The isotopic and chemical characteristics of dissolved gases in groundwater related to municipal landfills commonly differ from other non-polluted environments. In the survey presented in this study we investigated the geochemical and isotopic variations of dissolved hydrocarbons in a unique study area with different well defined ecological micro-habitats influenced by a former landfill for industrial and special waste. The dissolved methane concentrations have generally remained stable over the last decade but vary by several orders of magnitude in different zones of the area. The dominant methanogenic pathways can be clearly distinguished in the different ecosystems. Methyl-type fermentation methanogenesis prevails in the shallow groundwater zone (5–15 m depth) in- and outside the landfill. Anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to sulfate reduction occurs in the shallow downstream area within a former leachate plume. At larger depths CO2 reduction is the predominant methane formation pathway except within the physically isolated landfill site. The high ethane concentrations in a small part of the study area are potentially related to the degradation of volatile organic compounds. The background ethane concentrations are higher in the deeper groundwater zones, indicating the coupling to the CO2 reduction methanogenic pathway. The propane concentrations in most wells are below the detection limit, except within the waste site. Secondary methane oxidation, which frequently occurs in the groundwater in all environments can alter the gas composition mimicing the thermogenic gas signature in the standard Bernard-diagram. The isotopic fractionation between co-existing methane and formation water and carbon dioxide, respectively, differs from that suggested in standard interpretational diagrams (e.g. Bernard-Diagram and Whiticar-plots). Thus, the standard evaluation based on methane hydrogen and carbon isotopes is also susceptible to an erroneous interpretation as non-biogenic dissolved gases in other groundwater environments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Acetate fermentation; CO2 reduction; Ethane; Methane oxidation; Methanogenesis; Sulfate reduction","Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Dissolution; Ethane; Fermentation; Gases; Geochemical surveys; Groundwater pollution; Hydrogeology; Isotopes; Leachate treatment; Methanation; Methane; Oxidation; Sulfur compounds; Volatile organic compounds; Anaerobic methane oxidations; Chemical characteristic; CO2 reduction; Groundwater environment; Methane oxidation; Methanogenesis; Non-polluted environments; Sulfate reduction; Groundwater resources; acetate; aquifer; carbon dioxide; claystone; dissolved gas; ethane; fermentation; hydrogeochemistry; methanogenesis; reduction; sulfate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069851060

As current research shows, urban areas are more vulnerable to climate change than rural areas. Numerous people are affected by climate change in their daily life, health and well-being. The need to react is undisputed and has led to numerous guidelines and directives for urban climate adaptation. Plants are commonly mentioned and recommended as one key to urban climate adaptation. Due to shading of open space and building surfaces, as well as evapotranspiration, plants reduce the energy load on the urban fabric and increase thermal comfort and climate resilience amongst many other ecosystem services. Plants, therefore, are described as green infrastructure (GI), because of the beneficial effects they provide. Extensive green roofs are often discussed regarding their impact on thermal comfort for pedestrians and physical properties of buildings. By means of Stadslab2050 project Elief Playhouse in Antwerp, Belgium, a single-story building in the courtyard of a perimeter block, the effects of different extensive green roof designs (A and B) on the microclimate, human comfort at ground and roof level, as well as building physics are analyzed and compared to the actual roofing (bitumen membrane) as the Status Quo variant. For the analyses and evaluation of the different designs the innovative Green Performance Assessment System (GREENPASS®) method has been chosen. The planning tool combines spatial and volumetric analyses with complex 3D microclimate simulations to calculate key performance indicators such as thermal comfort score, thermal storage score, thermal load score, run-off and carbon sequestration. Complementary maps and graphs are compiled. Overall, the chosen method allows to understand, compare and optimize project designs and performance. The results for the Elief Playhouse show that the implementation of green roofs serves a slight contribution to the urban energy balance but a huge impact on the building and humans. Variant B with entire greening performs better in all considered indicators, than the less greened design Variant A and the actual Status Quo. Variant B will probably bring a greater cost/benefit than Variant A and is thus recommended. © 2019 by the authors.","Building energy; Climate-resilience; Green infrastructure; Green roof; Greenpass; Microclimate; Thermal comfort; Urban planning; Water retention",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073123086

The deactivation of one or more cylinders of a light-duty diesel engine during low load operation can be a sophisticated method to improve fuel economy and reduce especially NOx emissions at the same time. Dynamic Skip Fire (DSF) is an advanced cylinder deactivation technology, where the decision to fire or skip singular units of a multi-cylinder engine architecture is taken just prior to each firing opportunity, based on a balanced rankling of multiple input parameters. A DSF-equipped engine incorporates the ability to selectively deactivate cylinders on a cylinder event-by-event basis for best matching of the requested driver's torque demand at optimum fuel efficiency, while ensuring no drawback in terms of drivability with respect to fully firing engine. Dynamic Skip Fire has already demonstrated significant fuel economy improvements for throttled spark-ignition engines on a number of different applications. The publication presents the potential of the DSF technology in improving fuel economy while supporting the realization of ultra-low tailpipe emissions for small cylinder displacements as well as bigger cylinder bore diesel applications, covering LD as well as MD Diesel powertrains. The simulation activity has been carried out using an advanced, internally developed FEV Powertrain Simulation Platform. A representative state-of-the-art 4-cylinder 2.0-liter LD Diesel engine definition has been analyzed. Simulation results highlighted a significant CO2 benefit both on WLTC as well as RDE cycle. The analysis results obtained so far demonstrate that DSF technology, when applied to a light-duty diesel engine with optimized transmission shift scheduling, can achieve up to 0.5% to 1.5% fuel economy benefit, while realizing tailpipe nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions reduction up to 33%. The reduction of tailpipe NOx is achieved mainly by improved conversion efficiency in the NOx aftertreatment system due to increased exhaust temperatures with DSF technology. The investigations have been extended to a larger 6-cylinder 7.7-liter MD Diesel engine application for commercial applications. On this heavier application DSF shows approximately 50% reduction in terms of tailpipe NOx both on the European and American MD legislation cycle, together with a CO2 benefit respectively of 2.5 and 3.5%. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

Objectives: With time series data spanning 2000–2016, this study explored the proximate determinants of ambient air pollution, mortality, and life expectancy in North America, Europe &amp; Central Asia, and East Asia &amp; Pacific regions. Methods: The study applied historical data on urban population, total pollution, energy consumption, GDP per capita, life expectancy, mortality rate and industrial PM2.5 emissions to develop six parsimonious models using the generalized least squares (GLS) random-effects model estimation with first-order autoregressive [AR(1)] disturbance across 54 countries. Results: An increase in income level by 1% declined mortality rate by 0.01% and increased longevity by ~0.02% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]) in the long-run. An increase in industrial PM2.5 emissions per capita by 1% decreased life expectancy by 0.004% and mortality rate by 0.02% (95% CI). Intensification of energy consumption and its related services by 1% were found to increase industrial PM2.5 emissions by 0.42–0.45% (95% CI). An inversed-U shaped curve between PM2.5 emissions per capita and income levels was found at a turning point of US$ 48,061. The validity of an environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis between ambient air pollution and urbanization was confirmed, while a rapid increase in population had a significant positive impact on ambient air pollution. Conclusion: Ambient air pollution contributes significantly in reducing life expectancy and increasing mortality. However, sustained economic development, along with energy efficiency, and sustainable urban settlement planning and management are potential options for reducing ambient air pollution while improving quality of life and environmental sustainability. © 2019","Air pollution; EKC hypothesis; Energy consumption; Environmental sustainability; Mortality rate; Panel data","Air pollution; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Industrial emissions; Least squares approximations; Particles (particulate matter); Public policy; Random processes; Sustainable development; EKC hypothesis; Environmental kuznets curve hypothesis; Environmental sustainability; First order autoregressive; Generalized least square; Mortality rate; Panel data; Proximate determinants; Population statistics; atmospheric pollution; emission control; energy use; life expectancy; mortality; mortality risk; panel data; particulate matter; sustainability; air pollution; Article; Asia; Australia; Canada; Central Asia; city planning; controlled study; East Asia; economic development; energy consumption; environmental management; environmental sustainability; Europe; geographic names; gross national product; human; income; industry; life expectancy; longevity; mortality; mortality rate; Pacific region; particulate matter; population; priority journal; quality of life; statistical model; time series analysis; United States; urban population; urbanization; validity; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental exposure; epidemiology; Far East; life expectancy; mortality; North America; particulate matter; statistics and numerical data; trends; Australia; Canada; Central Asia; Europe; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asia; Australia; Environmental Exposure; Europe; Far East; Life Expectancy; Mortality; North America; Particulate Matter; Quality of Life",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066014208

Both systems, designed to fulfill Euro 6 emissions regulations standards, consist of a closed-coupled Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) followed by a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst coated on a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF), also known as SCR on Filter (SCRoF or SCRF). While the two systems feature the same Urea Water Solution (UWS) injector, major differences could be observed in the UWS mixing device, which is placed upstream of the SCRoF, whose design represents a crucial challenge due to the severe flow uniformity and compact packaging requirements. First, both the ATS were experimentally characterized to determine the physical-chemical properties of the catalysts, the UWS spray characteristics (i.e. liquid penetration, droplets size) and to evaluate the NOx conversion efficiency under steady state flow conditions, representative of type-approval operating conditions. The experiments highlighted significant differences in terms of NOx conversion efficiency between the two ATS, especially at low temperature operation. In order to highlight the root causes of these differences, numerical analyses were then conducted by means of a commercial 3D CFD code. A systematic methodology was developed to build a robust and reliable simulation setup, for both the ATS, and validated over the experimental data. The resulting simulation model was then used as a virtual test bench to understand the UWS spray evolution, breakup and mixing, the amount and location of liquid film and to evaluate the SCRoF inlet conditions in terms of species composition and flow uniformity indexes. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the different conversion of NOx at low temperature is mainly due to the different mixing systems design, which could enhance the production of ammonia from the UWS when the temperature conditions are far from the optimum, providing useful insights for future design and optimization of similar ATS. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

This study aims to compare the energy efficiency certification systems in Spain and Chile, identifying convergent and divergent parameters, enabling the existing gaps to be identified and improvements noted for both systems. To do so, 20 sample dwellings in Santiago de Chile were evaluated, along with the local calculating tools in both countries. The analysis considered the aspects of regulation, its reach, the characterization of the models and the necessary indicators. The comparison identified, among others, differences such as obligatory implementation of the system, a study of the existing buildings in the focus area, the prevailing indicators for evaluating the effects of the buildings, the low incidence of mixed energy systems in the Chilean system and the possibility of proposing and evaluating improvements in the Spanish system. As a result, higher energy requirements and greater CO2 emissions were identified in the Chilean system, reaching differences of 42 kWh/m2/year in consumption and 14 kgCO2/m2/year in emissions with regard to the Spanish qualification. The results of this comparison have facilitated the identification of improvements that will increase the evaluation standards of the Chilean system. © 2019 by the authors.","Comparable certification; Energy efficiency certification; Energy equivalence; Energy saving; Operating energy; Sustainable housing","carbon emission; certification; comparative study; energy conservation; energy efficiency; policy implementation; Chile; Metropolitana; Santiago [Metropolitana]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071975678

The selected ES include: provisioning—commercial fisheries, and pearl and crocodile cultivation; regulating and maintenance—blue carbon, storm protection and erosion control, and genepool protection; cultural—recreational fishing, tourism, amenity and other non-fishing recreational, and Indigenous cultural values, which were evaluated applying a mix of market and non-market valuation tools. A simple framework of measuring each ES both for its ‘Economic Impact’—direct and indirect market value (i.e. reflection in GDP), and ‘Economic Value’—market and non-market values for their contributions to the broader NT economy (i.e. human well-being), was applied. Due to methodological limitations, Indigenous cultural values were partially measured using a substitute value for 25% of government Indigenous expenditure on four welfare sectors that relate to benefits people obtain from their coastal and marine resources.

Standard Mode-II coupons and skin-stringer sub-elements were manufactured while their electrical resistance was monitored. Mode-II energy fracture was improved when adding CNTs in comparison to neat adhesive joints due to their toughening effect. Electrical monitoring showed a stable increase of the electrical resistance with crack length with lower sensitivity than Mode-I testing due to a lower crack opening effect. A good agreement was observed by comparing to theoretical estimations, indicating a uniform adhesive distribution inside the joint, confirmed by SEM analysis. Monitoring tests on skin-stringer sub-elements subjected to bending load showed a similar behavior but some sharp increases were observed, especially in the last stages of the test, due to a less uniform adhesive distribution in the central region.

In this study, we used ingrowth cores to investigate the impacts of regular rotation of the cores, defaunation and nitrogen addition on AMF, microbial biomass and microarthropods in the fermentation/humus (F/H) and litter (L) layers of an Ecuadorian montane tropical rainforest. AMF were substantially reduced in the F/H layer (to 34% of initial), while in the L layer they remained constant during the experiment. Overall, microorganisms and microarthropods were largely independent of AMF hyphae and their exudates, however, defaunation strongly affected the recovery of their communities. Nitrogen addition increased the quality of litter material and beneficially affected microbial communities thereby increasing decomposition rates, but did not impact AMF abundance and microarthropod communities. These findings suggest that the cutoff of the carbon supply from the plant to the fungal mycelium was not compensated by switching resources in the F/H layer, underlining a strong association between AMF and living roots. While in the L layer, AMF likely competed with saprotrophic microorganisms for litter-derived resources at intermediate stages of decomposition pointing to indirect contributions of AMF to decomposition processes. Overall, the results support the view that root-derived resources are important in fueling soil food webs, but also indicate that in the studied montane rainforest these resources are only available close to roots and not channeled distant to roots via AMF. © 2019, International Society for Tropical Ecology.","Acari; Collembola; Organic layer; Oribatid mites; Root-derived resources; Saprotrophic fungi","arbuscular mycorrhiza; arthropod; biomass; decommissioning; decomposition; food web; fungus; microbial community; microorganism; mite; rainforest; soil ecosystem; Acari; Collembola; Fungi; Oribatida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073975290

Particularly, cement sector as a significant contributor to climate change has to implement strategies to reduce its environmental impacts. But, effective strategies have to be complemented by adequate methodological techniques to assess, guide and certificate sustainability. Amongst all the techniques developed by the scientific community in recent years, life cycle techniques highlight as one of the most used one due to its integrated and holistic philosophy. In Cuba, a new cement based on a combination of calcined clay and limestone to reduce clinker to 50% (Low Carbon Cement, LC3) is been developed as part of an international collaboration project. The main goal of this research is to assess sustainability of cement sector in Cuba using life cycle techniques such as: Life cycle assessment (environmental-LCA), Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA), Life Cycle Costing (LCC), Economic Life Cycle Assessment (EcLCA). As part of the assessment LC3 is compared with traditional produced cements in Cuba OPC and PPC.

Different hypothesis have been proposed in the last years to explain the processes by which African dust storms generates negative health effect over urban areas in southern Europe but are still not clear. Some authors have suggested the existence of an interaction between air pollutants from local sources and the occurrence of African dust outbreaks, with a consequent increase in the risk of mortality due to exposure to these anthropogenic emissions. This study sought to identify such a synergistic effect in the Madrid metropolitan area. To this end, an assessment of the influence of African dust on air quality levels, the vertical structure of the atmosphere over Madrid and daily mortality was carried out. Our results indicated that African dust caused a reduction of the mixing layer height and the surface wind speed, by reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground. These facts favored the accumulation of air pollutants emissions from local anthropogenic sources. Moreover, when the dust contribution to PM10 levels exceeded a threshold value (8 μg/m3), particulate matter mass (PM10, PM2.5)and number (ultra-fine particles)concentration as well as levels of gaseous air pollutants (CO, NO and NO2)registered at urban-background and urban-traffic monitoring sites, increased with statistical significance. In these conditions, it was found a statistically significant increase in risk of daily mortality in the PM10 exposure. Hence, ambient air in Madrid was more toxic during African dust events of increasing intensity due to this synergistic effect. Because it can be envisaged that the frequency, duration and intensity of dust storms will increase in the north of Africa due to climate change, it will be a priority to put forward and assess proposals to mitigate the adverse effects on health, focused on the reduction of air pollutant emissions from local sources, as well as proposals regarding the adaptation of the population in urban areas across the Mediterranean basin. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","African dust outbreaks; Health effects; Mixing layer height; PM10","Air quality; Climate change; Health; Mixing; Particulate emissions; Storms; Urban growth; Wind; African dust; Air pollutant emission; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric pollutants; Health effects; Mixing layer height; PM10; Statistical significance; Dust; air quality; atmospheric pollution; dust; health impact; metropolitan area; mixing; mortality; particulate matter; Madrid [Madrid (ADS/PRV)]; Madrid [Spain]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064878381

To synthesize the existing knowledge, this review analyzes the magnitude of and the trends in global and local exposure to NO2 in schools and offices, and the factors that control exposure. Methods: For the literature review, Web of Science, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and PubMed were searched using 42 search terms and their combinations to identify manuscripts, reports, and directives published between 1971 and 2019. The search was then extended to the reference lists of relevant articles. Results: The calculated median, as well as the mean, concentration of NO2 in school (median 21.1 μg/m3; mean 29.4 μg/m3) and office settings (median 22.7 μg/m3; mean 25.1 μg/m3) was well below the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of 40 μg/m3 for the annual mean NO2 concentration. However, a large range of average concentrations of NO2 were reported, from 6.00 to 68.5 μg/m3 and from 3.40 to 56.5 μg/m3 for school and office environments, respectively, indicating situations where the WHO guidelines are exceeded. Outdoor levels of NO2 are a reliable predictor of indoor NO2 levels across seasons, with mean and median Indoor/Outdoor (I/O) ratios of 0.9 and 0.7 in school and 0.9 and 0.8 in office environments, respectively. The absence of major indoor NO2 emission sources and NO2 sinks, including chemical reactions and deposition, are the reasons for lower indoor NO2 concentrations. During the winter, outdoor NO2 concentrations are generally higher than during the summer. In addition, various building and indoor environment characteristics, such as type of ventilation, air exchange rates, airtightness of the envelope, furnishing and surface characteristics of the building, location of the building (urban versus suburban and proximity to traffic routes), as well as occupants' behavior (such as opening windows), have been statistically significantly associated with indoor NO2 levels in school and office environments. Conclusions: Indoor exposure to NO2 from the infiltration of ambient air can be significant in urban areas, and in the case of high traffic volume. Although reducing transportation emissions is challenging, there are several easier means to reduce indoor NO2 concentrations, including a ventilation strategy with suitable filters; location planning of new schools, classrooms, and ventilating windows or intakes; traffic planning (location and density); and reducing the use of NO2-releasing indoor sources. © 2019 The Authors","Air pollution; Indoor/outdoor ratio; Nitrogen dioxide; Office environments; School environments; Sources","Air pollution; Elementary particle sources; Indoor air pollution; Location; Urban planning; Indoor/outdoor ratios; Nitrogen dioxides; Office environments; Office indoor environments; School environments; Surface characteristics; Susceptible population; World Health Organization; Nitrogen oxides; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); indoor air; literature review; nitrogen dioxide; occupational exposure; pollutant source; pollution exposure; respiratory disease; traffic emission; ventilation; World Health Organization; air conditioning; ambient air; chemical parameters; chemical reaction; clinical practice; concentration (parameter); environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental parameters; human; indoor air pollution; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; school; seasonal variation; suburban area; systematic review; traffic pollution; trend study; urban area; work environment; air pollutant; exposure; indoor air pollution; school; workplace; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Nitrogen Dioxide; Schools; Workplace",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066961277

Hypercarb™ graphite-like carbon material exhibits high adsorption selectivity in separating the investigated isomeric dipyridyl and its derivatives. It is shown that the possibility of forming strong intramolecular C–H–N'-hydrogen bonds in a molecule of 2,2'-dipyridyl or its derivatives strengthens the adsorption bonding of adsorbate molecules and the surface of the graphite-like material due to stabilization of their planar conformation. Destabilizing this intramolecular hydrogen bond by adding substituents in different positions of the pyridine rings enhances the specific intermolecular interaction between adsorbate molecules and the solvent’s components and distorts the planar conformation of dipyridyls, weakening their retention on the Hypercarb™ material. Positive adsorption from the water–organic medium on the carbon adsorbent is observed for all of the investigated dipyridyls, with the exception of 2,2'-dipyridyl-N,N '-dioxide, which is adsorbed weaker than the solvent components. Anomalous medium–property dependences are found for the thermodynamic characteristics of the adsorption of dipyridyls on porous graphitic carbon, and are attributed to the predominance of adsorbate–adsorbent π–π interactions over hydrophobic ones and the resolvation of adsorbate molecules with acetonitrile in proportion to lowering the content of water in the bulk solution. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","adsorption; carbon; chromatography; dipyridyls; graphite; thermodynamics","Acetonitrile; Adsorption; Carbon; Chromatography; Conformations; Graphite; High performance liquid chromatography; Hydrogen bonds; Molecules; Porous materials; Thermodynamics; Adsorption selectivity; dipyridyls; Equilibrium conditions; Graphite-like carbons; Intermolecular interactions; Intra-molecular hydrogen bonds; Porous graphitic carbon; Thermodynamic characteristics; Driers (materials)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071475577

The empiricism associated with conventional multitemperature nonequilibrium models is abandoned in favor of the multigroup maximum entropy method combined with kinetics-informed adaptive binning. This group-based approach allows for time-varying optimal reduced-order representation of the internal state population distribution while accounting for all collisional processes included in the state-to-state model. Similarly, radiative transfer calculations are performed efficiently by discretization in the spectral, angular, and spatial spaces using the smeared band, discrete ordinate, and finite-volume methods, respectively. This reduction in computational overhead allows truly non-Boltzmann simulations with two-way coupling between the flow and radiation fields to be realized without simplifying approximations based on the tangent-slab method or local escape-factors. The simulation procedure is used in conjunction with the US3D flow solver to investigate the impact of vibrational nonequilibrium on CO2 wake flows and resultant infrared radiation around the Mars 2020 vehicle. This involves comparing predictions for flow-field properties and radiative transfer obtained using the conventional two-temperature model, the multigroup non-Boltzmann model, and for decoupled/coupled flow-radiation calculations. Conventional two-temperature models overestimate the rate of thermal equilibration in the near-wake region resulting in the population of midlying and upper CO2 vibrational levels being underpredicted by multiple orders of magnitude. Additionally, the two-temperature approach (in comparison to bin-based StS) overpredicts the rate of CO2 dissociation thereby leading to erroneous estimates for flow properties in the postshock region (primary source of afterbody radiative emission).

Understanding the effects of environmental and human activities is critically important in vulnerable ecosystems like arid and semi-arid forests, given climate variability coupled with historical human activities. Zagros forests are one of the largest vegetation communities in the Middle East. This region is highly affected by dust storms which are mainly a result of the loss of vegetation. This current study is an exploration of changes to aboveground carbon (AGC) density as affected by climate change (CC) and local management from 1987 to 2015 at 5-year intervals based on Landsat imagery and field data, analyzed with stochastic gradient boosting regression. Two sites with different local management practices were selected in Zagros coppice oak forests and AGC density was measured using field sampling. Four climate variables including mean annual temperature, rainfall, and evaporation were used to explore the effect of CC on AGC density dynamics over the study period. Results revealed an upward trend of AGC density in all intervals for both sites (from 6.36 to 7.5 ton ha−1) except for the 2010–2015 interval. The decrease of AGC density between 2010 and 2015 was likely related to dieback of oak trees due to different factors such as dust storms, pests, and other diseases. The trend of increasing AGC density in SarfiruzAbad forests was more than in Gahvareh forests, which is indicative of the young forest stand growth created by conservation and regeneration of damaged forests. Due to the large effect of local management on AGC density, our findings indicate that it was difficult to assess the effect of CC on AGC density. Our results suggest that other forests with a high degree of human disturbance, like Zagros forests, can play a role in mitigating global warming if the local management strategies are optimized. Additionally, these results demonstrate that in a region with no historical information about carbon stored in forests and woodlands, like most developing countries, Landsat-based AGC monitoring can provide information for forest managers and policy makers for understanding carbon accounting under human disturbances and CC, which could guide forest management strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aboveground carbon; Climate change; Landsat imagery; Local management; Zagros forests","aboveground production; carbon cycle; climate change; developing world; environmental disturbance; forest management; forestry policy; global warming; Landsat; sampling; Zagros",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069660794

In this paper, demand response (DR) programs and smart charging/discharging of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are investigated for improving the reliability of radial distribution systems adopting particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Such analysis is accomplished due to the positive effects of both DR and PEVs for dealing with emerging challenges of the world such as fossil fuel reserves reduction, urban air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the prioritization of DR and PEVs is presented for improving the reliability and analyzing the characteristics of distribution networks. The reliability analysis is performed in terms of loss of load expectation (LOLE) and expected energy not served (EENS) indexes, where the characteristics contain load profile, load peak, voltage profile and energy loss.

This method is increasingly used in industrial production for quality control. However, there is still no scientifically validated knowledge about the influences and interactions of different material parameters resulting from the heat treatment on the Barkhausen noise signal. Therefore, no standardized guideline for interpretation of inspection results exists up to now; each company uses own test procedures. In this study, carburized spur gears made from 18CrNiMo7-6 steel were finished by discontinuous profile grinding and the influences of varying material and heat treatment parameters on the measured Barkhausen noise, such as case hardening depth, surface carbon content and tempering temperature were investigated. Thanks to extensive complementary characterizations, different grinding burn levels were defined and further analyzed to evaluate single effects and interactions on the Barkhausen noise signal. These findings provide a foundation for a more reliable detection of grinding damages for different heat treatment states. Additionally, the application of a Barkhausen multiparameter approach was investigated for a more reliable differentiation between different damage types such as type B (light tempering zone) and type D (strong tempering zone). A variation of the filter settings was furthermore used to get information out of different depths of the subsurface region. During these investigations differences in the signals of the multiparameter analysis were found for different types of damages with varying filter settings. Using this knowledge a clear classification of different damages due to grinding is possible and more reliable compared to current methods. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",,"Case hardening; Damage detection; Grinding (machining); Tempering; Testing; Heat treatment parameters; Industrial production; Material parameter; Micromagnetic methods; Multiparameter analysis; Reliable detection; Subsurface regions; Tempering temperature; Spur gears",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071087228

In Malaysia, due to its location near the equator, makes solar energy the most utilized renewable energy resources. Unlike conventional power generation, solar energy is considered as uncertain generation sources which will cause unstable energy supplied. The uncertainty of solar resource needs to be managed for the planning of the PV system to produce its maximum power. The statistical method is the most prominent to manage and model the solar irradiance uncertainty patterns. Based on one-minute time interval meteorological data taken in Pekan, Pahang, West Malaysia, the Monte Carlo-Beta probability density function (Beta PDF) is performed to model continuous random variable of solar irradiance.

This topic has received significant attention from the research community, producing many estimations of Europe's onshore wind potential for capacity and generation. Despite this focus, previous estimates appear to have underpredicted both the amount of available future wind capacity as well as its performance. Foremost in this regard is the common use of contemporary, or at least near-future, turbine designs which are not fitting for a far-future context. In response to this, an improved, transparent, and fully reproducible work flow is presented here, and applied to determine a future-oriented onshore wind energy potential for Europe. Within a scenario of turbine cost and design in 2050, 13.4 TW of capacity is found to be available, allowing for 34.3 PWh of average generation per year. By sorting the explicitly-placed potential installation locations by their expected generation cost, national relationships between cost and performance versus installed capacity are found, and it is also seen that all countries possess some potential for onshore wind energy generation below 4 ct€ kWh-1. Furthermore, it is unlikely for these costs to exceed 6 ct€ kWh-1 in any future capacity scenario. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Economic potential; Land eligibility; Onshore wind energy; Renewable energy systems; Simulation; Technical potential","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Economic potentials; Onshore winds; Renewable energy systems; Simulation; Technical potential; Wind power; design; economic analysis; greenhouse gas; installation; land use location; performance assessment; renewable resource; simulation; wind power; wind turbine; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068112378

Multiple factors can influence C sequestration, making it difficult to discern the effect of a single factor. We used a modeling approach to evaluate the relative effects of individual factors on C stocks in three agricultural systems in Kerala, India. Background and Objectives: Factors such as plant growth form, management, climate warming, and soil texture can drive differences in C storage among cropping systems, but the relationships among these factors and their effects are complex. Our objective was to use CENTURY, a process-based model of plant-soil nutrient cycling, in an experimental mode to evaluate the effects of individual factors on C stocks in soil and biomass in monocultures (annuals or trees) and agroforestry systems. Materials and Methods: We parameterized the model for this region, then conducted simulations to investigate the effects on C stocks of four experimental scenarios: (1) change in growth form; (2) change in tree species; (3) increase in temperature above 20-year means; and (4) differences in soil texture. We compared the models with measured changes in soil C after eight years. Results: Simulated soil C stocks were influenced by all factors: growth form; lignin in tree tissues; increasing temperature; and soil texture. However, increasing temperature and soil sand content had relatively small effects on biomass C. Conclusions: Inclusion of trees with traits that promoted C sequestration such as lignin content, along with the use of best management practices, resulted in the greatest C storage among the simulated agricultural systems. Greater use and better management of trees with high C-storage potential can thus provide a low-cost means for mitigation of climate warming. © 2019 by the authors.","Agroforestry systems; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Cropping system; Growth form; Lignin","Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Ecology; Lignin; Soils; Storage (materials); Storage management; Temperature; Textures; Agroforestry system; Best management practices; Carbon sequestration; Cropping systems; Growth form; Increasing temperatures; Process-based modeling; Soil nutrient cycling; Forestry; agroforestry; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; cropping practice; growth form; lignin; modeling; soil texture; tree; Biomass; Carbon; Ecology; Forestry; Temperature; India; Kerala",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072516939

Chaotic approach is one alternative approach to predict any data series. Prediction through chaotic approach is made after three important parameters which are delay time τ, embedding dimension m and numbers of nearest neighbor k were determined. Therefore, the chaotic approach is applied. In this study, predictions are done to Carbon Monoxide time series observed at Shah Alam in Malaysia. Parameters τ and m are determined through average mutual information and Cao method respectively. While for k, most of the past researches frequently used try and error method. In this study an improvement of the method in determining the number of k is introduced. This improved method is done through plotting the graph of k versus the correlation coefficient (cc) of prediction model. Parameter cc is obtained through the prediction of data series using local mean approximation method (LMAM), local linear approximation method (LLAM) and improved local linear approximation method (ILLAM). Result shows that the cc value of LMAM is 0.9821 with k = 7, LLAM is 0.9873 with k = 3 and ILLAM is 0.9913 with k = 13. Therefore, the improved methods suggest that the optimal value of k is ranged from 3 ≤ k ≤ 13. It is hoped that the improved method can be used for future research in developing a better prediction model for chaotic data series. © BEIESP.","Carbon monoxide; Chaotic approach; Data series; K-nearest neighbor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075357014

Precipitation regime shift and permafrost thaw due to climate change will likely trigger changes in fen plant community structure through shifts in these PFGs, and it is thus crucial to understand how these PFGs will impact carbon cycling and greenhouse gas dynamics to predict and model peatland-climate feedbacks. In this study, we detail the above and belowground effects of these PFGs on aspects of carbon cycling using a mesocosm approach. We hypothesized that PFGs capable of aerating the rhizosphere (sedges, horsetails, and grasses) would oxidize the belowground environment supporting higher redox potentials, a favorable environment for decomposition, and higher CO2:CH4 in pore water and gas efflux measurements than PFGs lacking aerenchyma (cinquefoil, unplanted control). Overall, sedges, horsetail and grasses had an oxidizing effect on rhizosphere pore water chemistry, producing an environment more favorable for methanotrophy during the growing season, as supported by an approximate isotopic enrichment of pore water methane (δ13CH4) by 5‰, and isotopic depletion in pore water carbon dioxide (δ13CO2) by 10‰, relative to cinquefoil treatments. Cinquefoil and unplanted control treatments fostered a reducing environment more favorable for methanogenesis. In addition, cinquefoil appeared to slow decomposition in comparison with the other PFGs. These findings, paired with PFG effects on oxidation–reduction potential and CO2 and CH4 production, point to the ability of rich fen plant communities to moderate biogeochemistry, specifically carbon cycling, in response to changing climatic conditions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Boreal ecosystems; Carbon cycling; Climate change; Peatlands; Trace gas; Vegetation","boreal forest; carbon cycle; community structure; decomposition; fen; functional group; isotopic composition; nutrient enrichment; peatland; permafrost; porewater; rhizosphere; thawing; trace gas; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; vegetation structure; Carex; Equisetales; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074148793

As insulin resistance impairs mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and increases ROS in skeletal muscle, we considered whether similar events occur in the brain, which - like muscle - is rich in insulin receptors and mitochondria. We show that high-fat diet-induced (HFD-induced) brain insulin resistance in mice decreased mitochondrial ATP production rate and oxidative enzyme activities in brain regions rich in insulin receptors. HFD increased ROS emission and reduced antioxidant enzyme activities, with the concurrent accumulation of oxidatively damaged mitochondrial proteins and increased mitochondrial fission. Improvement of insulin sensitivity by both aerobic exercise and metformin ameliorated HFD-induced abnormalities. Moreover, insulin-induced enhancement of ATP production in primary cortical neurons and astrocytes was counteracted by the insulin receptor antagonist S961, demonstrating a direct effect of insulin resistance on brain mitochondria. Further, intranasal S961 administration prevented exercise-induced improvements in ATP production and ROS emission during HFD, supporting that exercise enhances brain mitochondrial function by improving insulin action. These results support that insulin sensitizing by exercise and metformin restores brain mitochondrial function in insulin-resistant states. © 2019, American Society for Clinical Investigation.",,"adenosine triphosphate; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; insulin receptor; metformin; mitochondrial protein; reactive oxygen metabolite; glucose; insulin; insulin receptor; metformin; peptide; S961 peptide; aerobic exercise; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain mitochondrion; brain region; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme metabolism; experimentation; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid diet; male; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pilot study; adverse event; animal; astrocyte; brain cortex; cell culture; cytology; disease model; drug effect; human; insulin resistance; intranasal drug administration; metabolism; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrion; nerve cell; oral drug administration; pathology; physiology; primary cell culture; Administration, Intranasal; Administration, Oral; Animals; Astrocytes; Cells, Cultured; Cerebral Cortex; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Glucose; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Metformin; Mice; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Neurons; Oxidative Stress; Peptides; Physical Conditioning, Animal; Primary Cell Culture; Receptor, Insulin; Sedentary Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072665868

In such cases, the dominant risk factors are associated with particulate matter (PM) bound metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this study, inhalation cancer risks (ICR) were assessed at Seoul metro subway stations (SMS), South Korea, in 2014–2015. Methods: The mass fractions of PAHs and metals in PM10 were calculated from the previous studies. The PM10 exposure and mass deposition in various sections of the human respiratory tract (HRT) was calculated using mass deposition technique. In addition, ICR via exposure of PM10 in HRT and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) were estimated for the teen and adult groups of commuters at SMS. Moreover, ICR levels have been compared with incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) levels for SMS commuters. Results: The PM10 pollution levels at SMS were found within the acceptable range for the subway platforms in Korean (150 μg/m3). In addition, the maximum amounts of total deposition (TD) and head deposition (HD) in HRT were estimated for the adult group. Hence, tracheobronchial (TB) and alveoli (A) depositions were calculated height for the teen. For the adult and teen groups, ICR(TD) level found significant (&gt;1 × 10−6) for Cr and PAHs. But, among both age groups, significant values of total ICR(TBD + AD) were estimated for the teen (1.40 × 10−06). In addition, the ICR(TD) and ILCR have estimated the same order of inhalation cancer risk for both groups. Conclusion: In the SMS, cancer risk levels were estimated in the acceptable range (1 × 10−06 - 1 × 10−05) of life carcinogenic risk for the commuters, provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). Furthermore, Cr and Ni were identified as significant contributors to inhalation cancer risks with 58% and 39% of total risk level, respectively for teen and adult. © 2019","Deposited mass in HRT; Incremental lifetime cancer risk; Inhalation cancer risks; Metals and PAHs; PM10; Subway metro station",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067849926

While an efficient after-treatment system, that includes a gasoline particulate filter, enables compliance with legislation requirements, lowering engine-out emissions by improving the combustion system must be considered as a crucial advantage for both pollutants emission control and performance. In this respect, high-performance enabling contents such as relatively large displacement, flow-capacity oriented intake ports and a limited stroke-to-bore ratio have significant drawbacks on the charge motion quality and, consequently, on mixture formation and homogeneity. As a countermeasure, fuel injection system components, as well as control strategies, need to be substantially improved. The increase of fuel injection pressure, coupled with optimized injection timing and splitting, has proven to be effective in reducing emissions, especially with regard to particulate matter. This paper provides results of an experimental study investigating the effect of different fuel injection strategies on engine-out emissions, with special emphasis on the influence of very high fuel injection pressures (up to 50 MPa) on particulate matter. A multi-hole inwardly-opening fuel injector fitted to a high specific power direct-injection spark ignition (DISI) single cylinder engine, was tested over a wide range of steady state operating conditions, including catalyst heating, part loads and rated power. A fast particle spectrometer was employed along with a PMP-compliant particle counter to fully characterize fuel injection pressure effect on particle number and size distribution. The results show that significant improvements can be achieved over the entire range of investigated engine operating conditions, especially in regard to particulate matter emissions. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of cloudbursts in many cities. As minor cloudburst events become more frequent and extreme events more severe, cities will need to rapidly transform their stormwater drainage and interdependent systems, and the knowledge systems that guide their infrastructure decisions and policy. In this paper, we discuss the evolution of knowledge systems to address these challenges, using three diverse cities (Phoenix, USA; Copenhagen, Denmark; and New York City, USA) as case studies. We found that partnerships between cities – even across national boundaries – can be a particularly important component of cloudburst knowledge systems. We also identified limitations in knowledge systems related to non-stationary climate, the vulnerability of private property and the representation of cloudburst infrastructure in integrated water management, which present opportunities for future research to support decision-making. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cities; Cloudburst; Flooding; Knowledge Systems; Resilience; Urban","article; city; climate; decision making; Denmark; flooding; New York; water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067385038

Changes to annual heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy use depend on climate, wall construction, wall orientation, building geometry, HVAC efficiency, and operating schedule. Changes to annual energy cost and energy-related emissions further vary with local energy prices and emission factors. We used EnergyPlus to perform over 100,000 whole-building energy simulations, spanning 10 different building categories, three building vintages, 16 California climate zones, and 15 United States (U.S.) climate zones. Cool walls yielded annual source energy, energy cost, and emission savings in all California climate zones and in warm U.S. (ASHRAE) climate zones. In California, annual whole-building HVAC energy cost savings were 4.0–27% in single-family homes, 0.5–3.8% in medium office buildings, and 0.0–8.5% in stand-alone retail stores. In warm U.S. climates—zones 1A (Miami, FL) through 4B (Albuquerque, NM)—annual HVAC energy cost savings were 1.8–8.3% in single-family homes, 0.3–4.6% in medium office buildings, and 0.5–11% in stand-alone retail stores. California and U.S. fractional source energy and emission savings were comparable to fractional energy cost savings.

However, current scenarios have a key weakness: they typically focus on reaching specific climate goals in 2100. This choice may encourage risky pathways that delay action, reach higher-than-acceptable mid-century warming, and rely on net removal of carbon dioxide thereafter to undo their initial shortfall in reductions of emissions. Here we draw on insights from physical science to propose a scenario framework that focuses on capping global warming at a specific maximum level with either temperature stabilization or reversal thereafter. The ambition of climate action until carbon neutrality determines peak warming, and can be followed by a variety of long-term states with different sustainability implications.

Unfortunately, there is still a pronounced lack of research in this area within developing countries in tropical regions, which are becoming increasingly urbanised and where mechanical air conditioning demands are rising dramatically. Many of these countries are adopting thermal comfort standards such as the ASHRAE Standard 55, the EN 15251, and the ISO 7730 to regulate the use of air-conditioning; even when these standards have been widely criticised for their inadequacy to suit other geographical regions and contexts, different to the ones that they were designed for. There is growing evidence to suggest the need to confirm these models through further post-occupancy studies and fieldwork in real buildings. Deficiencies in data collection and methodologies are thought to require particular attention, in order to develop algorithms that can predict thermal comfort levels with more accuracy. More comprehensive strategies considering relevant interrelated psychological, physiological and social factors are needed. This manuscript highlights gaps of research regarding thermal comfort in the built environment, through the analysis of Colombia as a case study. It is stressed here that new academic advancements in this area have had little effect on related policy. The work emphasises the importance of standardised fieldwork data and gives examples of alternative data collection and methodology systems. This aims to contribute to the current efforts of improving the understanding of occupant's adaptive behaviours and their potential impact on the mitigation of climate change. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air conditioning; ASHRAE standards; Climate change; Developing countries; Thermal comfort; Tropical engineering; Tropics; Urban planning; Adaptive behaviour; Built environment; Data collection method; Environmental quality; Occupant satisfaction; Potential impacts; Thermal comfort level; Tropical countries; Data acquisition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072957482

In order to reduce levels of air pollution in metropolitan areas, several countries have encouraged the use of electric vehicles in the cities. However, due to the high investment costs in this class of vehicles, it is expected that the spatial distribution of electric vehicles' adopters will be heterogeneous. The additional charging power required by electric vehicles' batteries can change operation and expansion planning of power distribution utilities. In addition, urban planning agencies should analyze the most suitable locations for the construction of electric vehicle recharging stations. Thus, in order to provide information for the planning of electric mobility services in the city, this paper presents a spatiotemporal model for estimating the rate of electric vehicles' adopters per subareas. Results are spatial databases that can be viewed in geographic information systems to observe regions with greater expectancy of residential electric vehicle adopters. These outcomes can help utilities to develop new services that ground on the rising availability of electric mobility in urban zones. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle adopters; Geographical information systems; Spatial regression; Sustainable city planning","Air quality; Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information use; Urban planning; Change operations; Electric mobility; Expansion planning; Metropolitan area; Power distributions; Spatial regression; Spatio-temporal models; Sustainable cities; Electric power distribution; air quality; atmospheric pollution; electric vehicle; environmental degradation; fossil fuel; GIS; public attitude; regression analysis; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068415429

The distribution is required for the correct prediction of the rates of surface processes, such as growth and oxidation, and furthermore it is important on its own because new regulations on particulate emissions require control of the number of smaller particles. Soot formation is strongly dependent on the local chemical composition and thermodynamic conditions and is therefore coupled with fluid dynamics, chemical kinetics and transport phenomena. Comprehensive modelling of soot formation in combustion processes requires coupling of the population balance equation, which is the fundamental equation governing aerosol dynamics, with the equations of fluid dynamics. The presence of turbulence poses an additional challenge, due to the non-linear interactions between fluctuating velocity, temperature, concentrations and soot properties. The purpose of this work is to review the progress made in aerosol dynamics models, their integration with fluid dynamics and the models for addressing the turbulence-soot interaction. © 2019, The Author(s).","Aerosol dynamics; Modelling; Population balance; Soot; Turbulent flow","Aerosols; Combustion; Dust; Models; Soot; Transport properties; Turbulence; Turbulent flow; Aerosol dynamics; Chemical compositions; Fluctuating velocities; Fundamental equations; Nonlinear interactions; Population balance equation; Population balances; Thermodynamic conditions; Atmospheric movements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071521537

However, in a manner similar to water consumption, land occupation has the potential to impact food production and thereby human health. In this study, the impact pathway linking land occupation and protein-energy malnutrition was modelled, establishing a new set of regionalised characterisation factors which were applied in a case study of cotton cultivation. Methods: The impact assessment model has three main components: a food production model, a food trade model and an effect factor that relates potential food deficits to malnutrition expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The food production model uses an NPP-based index to account for variation in the productive capability of land, as well as data on irrigation water supply and national agricultural yields to account for variation in prevailing agricultural technologies. Food production losses have the potential to impact national and global food supplies according to trade status and economic adaptation capacity assessed using the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. Health damage data from the Global Burden of Disease report and depth of national food deficit data from the FAO are the basis of the effect factor. Results and discussion: The model reports potential human health impacts related to land occupation (DALY/m2 year) at 5-arc-minute spatial resolution. The model is relevant to all kinds of land occupation, including food production, as no assumptions are made about the ways food products are utilised, which can be many. The model delivers results sensibly in proportion to potential human health impacts of freshwater consumption, i.e. greater in tropical areas and lesser in arid areas. The case study showed that land occupation impacts on human health might cause one DALY/t seed cotton in extreme cases and less than one DALY per thousand tonnes in others. In the case of India, ~ 9% of national malnutrition-related DALYs were attributable to cotton cultivation which occupies ~ 8% of arable land. Conclusions: This new model will enable more complete assessment of land occupation impacts in LCA and is especially relevant to the assessment of food, fibre, and bioenergy products. In addition, the model enhances the ability to assess trade-offs which frequently occur, such as between land and water use and GHG emissions. The cotton case study showed that human health impacts can be grossly underestimated in LCA studies when land occupation impacts are not included. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cotton; Human health; Land occupation; Land use footprint; Life-cycle impact assessment; Virtual flow of land; Virtual land use","water; agriculture; Article; catering service; controlled study; disability-adjusted life year; food industry; human; irrigation (agriculture); land occupation; land use; life cycle assessment; malnutrition; nonhuman; plant yield; priority journal; tillage; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061640521

The approach offers the possibility to analyze new engine control systems with fewer expensive engine dynamometer experiments and test drives. Thus, development cycles can be shortened and development costs reduced. This paper presents the development of an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and the correspondent Exhaust Aftertreatment System (EAS) model, its deployment on a HiL system and its application to pre-calibrate the engine for different vehicle cycles. A zero-dimensional mean value approach was chosen to guarantee adequate real-time factors for the coupling between the models and the Engine Control Unit (ECU). The main components of the airpath were parametrized according to data provided by the supplier and measurements. The combustion and NOx Engine-Out emissions were modeled using AVL-CRUISEMTM/MoBEOTM libraries, combining physical and empirical approaches, to reach an optimal trade-off between computational cost, accuracy, predictivity. For the other emission constituent, empirical correlations were obtained, and fed with simulated inputs to improve the accuracy in transient cycles. The quasi-dimensional aftertreatment model was parametrized using both synthesis gas test-bench and engine test bed measurements. The results for engine performance and emissions produced satisfactory agreement with both steady-state and transient measurements. Therefore, the presented methodology shows a great potential for testing and validation of new engine calibrations, as analyzed in a reference cycle described in detail. Besides, the use of this simulation method gives the opportunity to verify and optimize the behavior of the propulsion and exhaust aftertreatment systems in different operating conditions and in different engine applications as well, allowing to transfer a significant part of the calibration and testing work for emission calibration to the cost effective HiL environment. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

The ways in which this divide is closed will significantly affect the development of buildings-related emissions. This paper revisits previous work on the potential conflict between efforts towards closing the energy divide and enabling the achievement of higher levels of human well-being, and those associated with climate stabilization. It estimates the additional energy needed to achieve the former in terms of final energy consumption levels in key regions, and the associated emission pathways under different climate action scenarios. It then analyses the impact that such pathways could have on estimated carbon budgets associated with fulfilling the Paris Agreement, and provides some suggestions on how this impact could be minimized in the buildings sector. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Buildings-related emissions; Carbon budgets; Energy decarbonization policies; Energy poverty; Human well-being","Energy utilization; Stabilization; Carbon budgets; Climate stabilization; Developed countries; Energy consumption rates; Energy poverties; Potential conflict; Sub-saharan africa; Well being; Budget control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068465827

The rate of mass transfer of CO2 into a specific oil controls the rate of oil properties changes. Additionally, the rate of CO2 transfer into an oil sample is dependent on CO2 thermodynamic state which is a function of pressure and temperature. Hence, this study aims to investigate the mass transfer of CO2 into a crude oil at gas and also supercritical state to estimate the rate of resultant changes of the oil properties at these two different states. To do so, two mass transfer pressure decay tests were conducted to study the molecular diffusion of CO2 in a light crude oil at both supercritical and gas states. Later, a mathematical model was used to determine the mass transfer parameters, i.e. diffusion coefficient (D) and interface mass transfer coefficient (k), and the dynamic concentration distribution of CO2 within the oil phase. As a part of this study, the time-dependent changes of the crude oil properties due to the molecular diffusion process of CO2 were also obtained for both supercritical CO2 and CO2 at gas state. For this purpose, the results of pressure decay experiments were combined with the results of additional experiments carried out to measure PVT properties of the CO2-oil system including CO2 solubility, oil swelling, oil viscosity, and interfacial tension (IFT) at various pressures and a constant temperature. The measured mass transfer parameters, i.e. D and k, were found to be higher for CO2 at supercritical state than that at gas state. The higher diffusivity of the supercritical CO2 in the oil resulted in faster changes of the oil properties as compared to the rate of properties changes by CO2 gas. For instance, it took 2 h for the oil to be swollen by 30% when it was in contact with CO2 at supercritical state as compared to 10 h at gas state. In the case of oil viscosity, for example, during 9 h, 58% reduction in oil viscosity was resulted by supercritical CO2 as compared to 25% reduction by CO2 gas. The results of this study can be used for better planning of CO2-EOR projects and particularly for CO2 Huff and Puff where the soaking time needs to be optimized properly. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 mass transfer; CO2 solubility; EOR; IFT; Oil swelling; Supercritical CO2","Crude oil; Diffusion in liquids; Diffusion in solids; Enhanced recovery; Gases; Solubility; Viscosity; Additional experiments; CO2 solubility; Concentration distributions; Interface mass transfer; Mass transfer parameters; Molecular diffusion process; Oil swellings; Supercritical CO2; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; crude oil; enhanced oil recovery; mass transfer; solubility; thermodynamics; Neptunia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066132495

Since in the past few years hydrogen has been introduced as the future fuel, the aim of this study is to evaluate wind and solar energy potentials in prone areas of Iran by the Weibull distribution function (WDF) and the Angstrom-Prescott (AP) equation for hydrogen production. To this end, the meteorological data of solar radiation and wind speed recorded at 10 m height in the time interval of 3 h in a five-year period have been used. The findings indicate that Manjil and Zahedan with yearly wind and solar energy densities of 6004 (kWh/m2) and 2247 (kWh/m2), respectively, have the greatest amount of energy among the other cities. After examining three different types of commercial wind turbines and photovoltaic (PV) systems, it becomes clear that by utilizing one set of Gamesa G47 turbine, 91 kg/d of hydrogen, which provides energy for 91 car/week, can be produced in Manjil and will save about 1347 L of gasoline in the week. Besides, by installing one thousand sets of X21-345 PV systems in Zahedan, 20 kg/d of hydrogen, enough for 20 cars per week, can be generated and 296 L of gasoline can be saved.

More comprehensive analyses are necessary to accurately depict differences in air pollution characteristics over space and time. Our objective is to further these efforts by investigating spatial differences of air pollution mixtures across the US. We employed spatially constrained clustering approach (based on k-means algorithm) to group air pollution monitoring sites that exhibit distinct pollutant profiles or mixtures in the US over 9 years (2008–2016). We accounted for 20 chemical components of PM2.5. The resulting clusters of pollution mixtures are characterized and validated based on source emissions represented by land-use information. Our analysis resulted in 27 clusters with different number of sites. For example, the cluster 1 has 14 sites and it covers part of the southeast, including the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The southwest has a very prominent cluster with 8 sites (cluster 26), covering part of the Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Arkansas. In the west coast, two clusters were highlighted in our analysis, cluster 3 in California and cluster 7 in Washington and part of Oregon. Both clusters with 5 sites. We estimated that Cu, Se, NO3−, Cr, and Ba were the top five species that divided the study area into cluster of sites more effectively. Observing the concentration ratios (concentrations of the species i/concentration of PM2.5) for some of these clusters, our results show that clusters 3 and 7 in the west coast represent sites with high Na ratios. Cluster 13 in the northwest and part of the Midwest represents sites with high SO42− ratio. The cluster 16 with a single site in northeast has the highest SO42− ratio, representing almost the third quartile of the SO42− ratio. This is one of the few studies focused on spatial patterns analysis to estimate regions that exhibit distinct pollutant mixtures on a large scale.

Although previous studies have explored modeling of spatial patterns as a tool to improve human exposure assessment, little work has employed a multivariate clustering approach to identify spatial patterns in particle composition. In this study, we used this approach to assess the spatial patterns of ambient PM2.5 elemental concentrations in Eastern Massachusetts in the United States. To distinguish one cluster of sites from another, we considered air pollution sources and geodemographic variables. We evaluated spatial patterns for 11 elemental components of ambient PM2.5, which included S, K, Ca, Fe, Zn, Cu, Ti, Al, Pb, V, and Ni. The analyses for S, Ca, Cu, Ti, Al, and Pb resulted in: 2 clusters for Fe, Zn, V, and Ni; 3 clusters; and for 12 clusters for K. Overall, our findings suggest substantial variation of clusters among PM2.5 components. In addition, land use, population density, and daily traffic were used as variables to more effectively characterize clusters of sites. We used R2 values to estimate the effectiveness of each variable in characterizing clusters. Larger R2 values indicate better the discrimination among the sites. For example, population density had the highest R2 value when the analysis was performed for S, Ca, Zn, Ti, Al, Pb, and V; land use presented the highest R2 value for Cu, V, and Ni; and, traffic showed the highest R2 value for PM2.5 mass concentration. This study improves the ability to model both the between- and within-area variability of source emissions and pollution regime, using concentrations of PM2.5 components. There is substantial variation of clusters among PM2.5 components, suggesting that public policies for emission controls and public health need to be tailored to address the specific contributing variables. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Cluster analysis; Particle composition; PM2.5","Air pollution; Cluster analysis; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Air pollution sources; Elemental components; Elemental concentrations; Emissions and pollution; Particle composition; PM2.5; Population densities; Substantial variations; Land use; aluminum; calcium; copper; element; iron; lead; nickel; potassium; sulfur; titanium; vanadium; zinc; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; cluster analysis; concentration (composition); multivariate analysis; particulate matter; spatial variation; air pollutant; cluster analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; demography; environmental factor; land use; Massachusetts; particle size; population density; spatial analysis; statistical analysis; traffic pollution; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; particulate matter; procedures; United States; Massachusetts; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cluster Analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Massachusetts; Particulate Matter; Spatial Analysis; United States; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067285924

Many studies demonstrated the role of large-scale modes of climate variability such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), among many others. Climate indices have hence frequently been used as predictors in probabilistic models describing hydrologic extremes. However, standard climate indices such as ENSO/NAO are poor predictors in some regions. Consequently, this paper describes an innovative method to avoid relying on standard climate indices, based on the following idea: the relevant climate indices are effectively unknown (they are hidden), and they should therefore be estimated directly from hydrologic data. In statistical terms, this corresponds to a Bayesian hierarchical model describing extreme occurrences, with hidden climate indices treated as latent variables. This approach is illustrated using three case studies. A synthetic case study first shows that identifying hidden climate indices from occurrence data alone is feasible. A second case study using flood occurrences at 42 east Australian sites confirms that the model correctly identifies their ENSO-related climate driver. The third case study is based on 207 sites in France, where standard climate indices poorly predict flood occurrence. The hidden climate indices model yields a reliable description of flood occurrences, in particular their clustering in space and their large interannual variability. Moreover, some hidden climate indices are linked with specific patterns in atmospheric variables, making them interpretable in terms of climate variability and opening the way for predictive applications. ©2019.

However, there is a lack of review on linking N2O production and mitigation with microbial communities in wastewater treatment. In this study, various microbial communities contributing to N2O turnovers are reviewed according to their functions in nitrogen cycle, including ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea, comammox bacteria, autotrophic denitrifying bacteria, heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and non-denitrifying N2O reducers. Their metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions of N2O production are demonstrated, including nitrifier denitrification, nitritation, archaeal N2O production and denitrification pathways. The N2O emission factor of the nitrifier denitrification pathway is generally higher than nitritation pathway, and that of denitrifying bacteria depends on species and electron acceptors. The mitigation strategies are developed according to the dominating microbial communities. Overall, this review illustrates a comprehensive characteristic of N2O production by microbial communities in wastewater treatment, which could contribute to the development of effective N2O mitigation strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Microbial community; Mitigation strategies; N2O production","Ammonia; Bacteria; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Reclamation; Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea; Denitrifying bacteria; Electron acceptor; Enzymatic reaction; Metabolic pathways; Microbial communities; Mitigation strategy; Nitrous oxide production; Wastewater treatment; nitrous oxide; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; anammox bacterium; archaeon; Article; denitrification; denitrifying bacterium; microbial community; nitrogen cycle; nonhuman; priority journal; waste water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076062799

Seasonal trends for n-alkanes showed a higher carbon preference index (CPI) and Cmax at C29 in spring indicating the enhanced emission of higher plant waxes. Lower CPIs and Cmax at C23 were found in winter that should be associated with fossil fuel combustion. 13C-depletion in C29 n-alkane was observed during an extreme rainfall event, during which the inflow of air masses were originated from lower latitude regions. Higher concentrations of 13C-enriched C23 n-alkane in winter together with the air mass trajectories suggested that the Beijing aerosols were affected by the air masses transported from the southern regions. Fatty acids were abundant in fall and showed a bimodal pattern with Cmax at C16:0 and C18:0. Higher C24:0/FA ratios with 13C-enrichment occurred as influenced by southerly air masses, and lower C24:0/FA ratios with 13C-depletion was observed with northerly air masses in fall and winter. These results suggested that C24:0 fatty acid was more abundantly transported from the southwestern air masses and may be a powerful tool to distinguish polluted aerosol source regions. Moreover, the δ13C values of C24:0 fatty acid showed a positive correlation with levoglucosan, implying that the biomass-burning process may contribute 13C-enriched C24:0 fatty acid. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Compound-specific stable carbon isotopes; Fatty acids; Levoglucosan; n-Alkanes; Urban aerosols","aerosol; alkane; biomarker; carbon isotope; concentration (composition); fatty acid; seasonal variation; source apportionment; stable isotope; urban area; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072941719

Therefore, new approaches are required to improve the urban ecological function of buildings and to provide high-quality (urban) open spaces that affect the meso- and microclimate in a positive way. Based on the research project ""Green Resilient City"", this paper shows how climate simulations can support landscape and urban planning and development. A proof of concept for a multiscale tool set for the evaluation, regulation, and optimization of green and climate-sensitive urban planning projects is the overall aim. The tool-set combines a Green and Open Space Factor, as an urban planning index and controlling instrument, as well as three climate simulation models on different scales in order to harmonize them: the GREENPASS® as an optimization instrument on parcel and neighborhood level, MUKLIMO-3 on neighborhood and city level and Cosmo-CLM as evaluation tools on mesoclimatic and regional level. Several advantages arise from the unprecedented combination of these four instruments: It transfers the use of climate models to the planning process, enables the testing and optimization of different UGIs with a focus on how they can influence the climatic performance of the proposed design of an urban development or retrofit project and serves as a scientific basis for urban planning decisions on a political level. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

In this study, we use the WRF-Chem regional atmospheric model to explore the air quality and human health benefits of eliminating emissions from six different anthropogenic sectors (transport, industry, shipping, electricity generation, residential combustion, and open biomass burning) over South and East Asia in 2014. We evaluate WRF-Chem against measurements from air quality monitoring stations across the region and find the model captures the spatial distribution and magnitude of PM2:5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of no greater than 2.5 μm). We find that eliminating emissions from residential energy use, industry, or open biomass burning yields the largest reductions in population-weighted PM2:5 concentrations across the region. The largest human health benefit is achieved by eliminating either residential or industrial emissions, averting 467 000 (95% uncertainty interval (95UI): 409 000-542 000) or 283 000 (95UI: 226 000- 358 000) annual premature mortalities, respectively, in India, China, and South-east Asia, with fire prevention averting 28 000 (95UI: 24 000-32 000) annual premature mortalities across the region. We compare our results to previous sector-specific emission studies. Across these studies, residential emissions are the dominant cause of particulate pollution in India, with a multi-model mean contribution of 42% to population-weighted annual mean PM2:5. Residential and industrial emissions cause the dominant contributions in China, with multi-model mean contributions of 29% for both sectors to population-weighted annual mean PM2:5. Future work should focus on identifying the most effective options within the residential, industrial, and open biomassburning emission sectors to improve air quality across South and East Asia. © Author(s) 2019.",,"air quality; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; particulate matter; pollutant source; public health; China; India; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072643922

However, little is known regarding the approaches and processes of plan development and implementation, or the success and effectiveness of proposed measures. Mainstreaming is regarded as one approach associated with (implementation) success, but the extent of integration of local climate policies and plans in ongoing sectoral and/or development planning is unclear. This paper analyses 885 cities across the 28 European countries to create a first reference baseline on the degree of climate mainstreaming in local climate plans. This will help to compare the benefits of mainstreaming versus dedicated climate plans, looking at policy effectiveness and ultimately delivery of much needed climate change efforts at the city level. All core cities of the European Urban Audit sample were analyzed, and their local climate plans classified as dedicated or mainstreamed in other local policy initiatives. It was found that the degree of mainstreaming is low for mitigation (9% of reviewed cities; 12% of the identified plans) and somewhat higher for adaptation (10% of cities; 29% of plans). In particular horizontal mainstreaming is a major effort for local authorities; an effort that does not necessarily pay off in terms of success of action implementation. This study concludes that climate change issues in local municipalities are best tackled by either, developing a dedicated local climate plan in parallel to a mainstreamed plan or by subsequently developing first the dedicated and later a mainstreaming plan (joint or subsequent “dual track approach”). Cities that currently provide dedicated local climate plans (66% of cities for mitigation; 26% of cities for adaptation) may follow-up with a mainstreaming approach. This promises effective implementation of tangible climate actions as well as subsequent diffusion of climate issues into other local sector policies. The development of only broad sustainability or resilience strategies is seen as critical. © 2019 The Authors","Adaptation; EU-28; Europe; Local climate policy/ planning; Mainstreaming; Mitigation; Mitigation/ adaptation stocktaking; Mitigation/ adaptation tracking; Monetoring and evaluation (M&E); Urban areas/ cities; Urban audit","Urban planning; Adaptation; Europe; Local climate; Mainstreaming; Mitigation; Stocktaking; Urban areas; Urban audit; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067828774

Only few LCA studies consider these temporal variations. This paper investigates how climate change is currently considered in LCA studies. Three aspects related to the influence of climate change on the life cycle impact of buildings are focused on: (1) changes in operational energy use (heating and cooling) due to changes in the climatic context of the building, (2) changes in operational energy use due to technological evolution or climate regulations and (3) changes in energy mix due to climate regulations. All three influence the energy use and related environmental impact but the extent of the effect depends on the considered region, time step and environmental indicators. It is hence recommended to choose an appropriate time period when considering climate change in LCA and consider variations within a time period via dynamic building simulations or to include a static correction. A holistic set of impact categories should be focussed on to avoid burden shifting and the most influencing parameters should be checked via a sensitivity analysis. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

In order to appraise the tectono-geomorphic evolution of South India, it is essential to understand the relationships between intrinsic and extrinsic processes and their geomorphic expressions at a river basin scale. Seven geomorphometric parameters, namely, longitudinal profile (Lp), asymmetry factor (Af), hypsometric curve and hypsometric integral (HI), mountain front sinuosity (Smf), river sinuosity (R), stream length gradient (Sl), and shape factor (Shp) were calculated for selected drainage basins of South India. Spatial analyses of these parameters in the light of systematic field mapping were attempted in this study. The results show the occurrences of southern sub-basins with convex hypsometric curves indicating a youth stage and significant tectonic influence. The low and moderate Smf values within the basins are indicative of mountain fronts witnessing a high level of tectonic activity. The net effects of tectonic and geomorphometric processes are inferred to have been the responses of anti-clockwise rotation of the Indian Plate and ridge uplift-push from west. Directional change in Thamirabarani River Basin and drainage channel reorganizations in the Cauvery and Vaigai River basins stand testimony to these, among others. Amidst these, occurrences of tectonically quiescent regions and multiple incisions by river channels and flow of modern river channels in inherited palaeovalleys but on tangent directions of ancient flows are also observed. Five stages of landscape development are envisaged: First, inheritance of river basins from palaeodrainage systems; second, reversal of river flow directions during early part of Cenozoic and inception of evolution of modern river systems; third, during Miocene–Pliocene; fourth, during Pleistocene–Early Holocene; and fifth, during the Holocene–Anthropocene. The recent resurgence of tectonics is not only reflected in the shifting of axial rivers, but is also evidenced by seismicity and landslides/faulting. Together, transient nature of the Southern Indian Plate, first-order control of tectonics, followed by climate and lithology over landscape evolution, inheritance of river valleys, synonymy of river basin responses to intrinsic and extrinsic geomorphic processes, however with unique signatures and basin-scale responses, are inferred. Detailed morphometric studies and supplementation with precise age data may fine-tune the proposed model. According to the model, inheritance of Mesozoic valley/structures during Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous, drainage reversal and initiation of Cenozoic–Recent river basin evolution, intense peneplanation during Miocene–Pliocene, intense incision during Pleistocene, periodic climatic extremes during Early Cenozoic, Palaeocene–Eocene, Oligocene and corresponding pedogenesis, and terrace formation and sedimentation have been recognized. Based on the numerical ages and documentation of basin-scale distribution of specific types of lithologies/weathering profiles/palaeosols, provisionally we recognize the laterite/ferricrete–bauxite–calcrete 53–50 and 37–23 Ma to be the oldest weathering profiles, palaeosols (I generation palaeosols) of alluvial fans with texturally immature parent rock clasts to be of 23–9 Ma, palaeosols with intensive calcitized rootlets that are found to occur in fluvial terraces of palaeo-floodplain/natural levee (II generation palaeosols) to be of 3.5–2.5 Ma, and relict alluvium that are documented in inland river terraces and older deltaic plains and calcareous sandstones that are documented in coastal terraces to be of ~1 Ma old and attribute them to be the results of significant climatic events and Early Cenozoic uplift of Western Ghat that proceeded from south–north and its intensive tilt toward east since 25 Ma until today at a rate of 0.1 mm/year to be tectonic events that have significantly contributed toward landscape development on basin-regional scales and concur with the evolutionary stages proposed in our model. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","climate forcing; inherited structures and palaeosols; landscape evolution; river basin; Southern India; tectonic continuum","climate forcing; geomorphology; landscape evolution; paleosol; river basin; stratigraphy; tectonic evolution; Cauvery River; India; Tamil Nadu; Thamirabarani River; Vaigai River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067654564

Secondly, this paper discusses the errors that can be made in conducting case studies. Thirdly and finally, it shows lessons learned and provides guidelines to setup case studies, conduct the measurements, perform the statistical analysis and report the results to policy makers and the wider audience. To achieve climate change mitigation targets, using alternative fuels, e.g., biodiesel, hydrogen or electricty (EVs) for the urban fleets requires an in-depth analysis of the impacts under real-world operating conditions. Such experiments are generally very complex as numerous factors could directly or indirectly interfere with the results produced and potentially jeopardize the integrity of the research and the conclusions drawn. Results of the present research show that some vital parameters were ignored by many of the studies performed including the statistical uncertainties, driving cycle uncertainties and fuel uncertainties. Lack of appropriate experimental designs or clear assertions about the level of significance for differences in emissions/fuel consumption between alternative fuels (i.e. biodiesel) and the reference fuel used (i.e., diesel) could be regarded as the main weaknesses. Moreover, many other overarching and very influential factors (e.g., covariates/confounders) can interfere with the research outcomes as these were mostly overlooked by the reviewed studies. A careful and complete experimental design for assessments of alternative fueled vehicles (are critical when conducting real-world operating condition tests. The study findings help to formulate the guidelines for assessing real-world operating condition experiments to achieve the most feasibly and meaningful research outcomes that will have significant implication for local and global policy makers. The guidelines are of use for all types of research studies that want to evaluate the effects of alternative fuels for any transportation fleet. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative fuels; Biodiesel; Electric Vehicles; Experimental design; Guidelines; Real-world operating condition; Urban transportation system","Biodiesel; Climate change; Decision making; Design of experiments; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Hydrogen fuels; Statistics; Urban transportation; Bio-diesel blends; Climate change mitigation; Guidelines; Influential factors; Operating condition; Statistical uncertainty; Transportation fleet; Urban transportation systems; Alternative fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065747167

Given the active rifting environment in which magma of the Duluth Complex (1.1 Ga) has intruded as repeated pulses, fluid inclusions in olivine are traceable throughout an entire stratigraphic drill core section with comparable textural features that enable a classification of three generations: (1) primary CH4-rich fluid inclusions oriented parallel to growth planes of olivine or arranged in clusters; (2) intragranular fluid inclusion planes of CH4-rich fluid inclusions extending towards grain boundaries and (3) transgranular fluid inclusion planes of CH4-rich fluid inclusions, closely associated with serpentinization. The hydrous minerals and carbonates contained in fluid inclusions of generations (1) and (2) indicate that original constituents of the early homogenous magmatic fluid must have been H2O and CO2. Upon cooling (below 700 °C), at fixed Pfluid (2 kbar) and fO2 fluid at or below QFM conditions, an increase of XCH4 at the expense of CO2 results in the CH4-rich chemistry of the fluid. The formation of late secondary fluid inclusion planes of generation (3) is related to extensive magma-country rock interaction. These inclusions contain no solids and their composition reflects the reduction of CO2 to CH4 during serpentinization in an upper stability limit of 620 °C.

A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser pulse (1064 nm, 7 ns, ≤ 4.5 × 109 W/cm2) focused onto the surface of a glassy carbon target results in its ablation. The spark-discharge (∼1.2 J energy, ∼1 μs duration) is initiated along the direction of the plume propagation between the target surface and a grounded mesh that is parallel to the target surface. Ions emitted from the laser-spark plasma are detected by their time-of-flight using a Faraday cup. The ion energy-to-charge ratio is analyzed by a three-mesh retarding field analyzer. In one set of experiments, the laser plasma is generated by target ablation using a 50 mJ laser pulse. In another set of experiments, ∼1.2 J spark-discharge energy is coupled to the expanding plasma to increase the plasma density and temperature that results in the generation of carbon multicharged ions up to C6+.

This is particularly true in densely populated and low lying deltas such as Bangladesh. However, the climate-health nexus is a relatively poorly explored domain of research, which is a cause for concern given the country's intrinsic vulnerability to climatic impacts. The impact of climate change on human health and well-being can be manifested through different pathways and can be categorized as being direct or indirect, mediated through complex biophysical and social dynamics. The direct effects of climate change that have been observed in Bangladesh include morbidity and mortality due to heat stress, cyclones, floods, droughts and other weather extremes at different spatio-temporal scales. The indirect effects adopt more complex routes which includes, threatening food and water security due to salinity intrusion, and spread of infectious diseases due to changes in vector and pathogen ecology. Social dynamics in Bangladesh, such as those related to gender roles, poverty and power relations, also influence how the effects of climate change are experienced by different segments of the society. The Government of Bangladesh has a number of measures already in place, efforts that have been complemented by local interventions. Evidence to take robust health policy decisions related to climate change is limited and scattered, while there is a lack of multidisciplinary research efforts. Considering these limitations, generating and summarizing scientific evidence is vital for informing a resilient health system against future public health concerns in climate vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh and in other low-income regions.

Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 93, pp. 585-596. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The increase of offshore PV and wind power installation capacity can increase the uncertainty and randomness of the power system. Therefore, it is necessary to study the offshore multi-energy system. A traditional offshore community with hybrid energy storage system (HESS) installation usually participates in demand response program to improve system economy. However, due to the high price and low discharge power of the HESS, it cannot response to the loads effectively. This paper introduces water electrolysis and on-board hydrogen storage technologies to an offshore multi-energy system, so as to effectively optimize the operation of system. Subsequently, to analyze the impact of climate change on system operation, the concept of loads matching degree is firstly defined. Finally, this paper gives a suggestion for an existed offshore multi-energy system on how to reasonably increase renewable generation system installation capacity. Results show that compared with the traditional offshore multi-energy system, the improved system can significantly reduce system operation costs and carbon emissions by 23.02% and 48.43%, respectively. Additionally, with the increase of loads matching degree, offshore system optimal operation costs, carbon emissions and the amount of hydrogen produced by water electrolysis reduce significantly. Finally, the growth of renewable energy generation capacity can lead to the reduce of emissions and increase of operating costs. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.","demand response; hydrogen; loads matching degree; Offshore multi-energy system; water electrolysis technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072679942

In this paper, the concentrated solar heat is utilized to drive the high-endothermic methane reforming with carbon looping. In so doing, the process increases the utilization of CO2 and reduces the carbon emissions as well as saves the extra fuel consumption for combustion, leading to high efficiency of energy utilization. By optimizing this proposed system, the energy efficiency can reach approximate 67.13% with simultaneously reducing CO2 emissions by 34.98% compared with SMR process. Exergy analysis is used to assess the location of irreversibility within process. The maximal part of exergy destroyer was localized in reformer with a contribution of 68%.

Cities are the main sources of carbon emissions and the key to solving these problems. Therefore, research on reducing carbon dioxide emissions is a matter of concern. In this study, a spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed to understand the spatial characteristics of carbon dioxide emissions in 171 Chinese cities. Then, stepwise and geographically weighted regressions were used to explore the processes that drive carbon dioxide emissions in Chinese cities. A two-step cluster was used to classify Chinese cities into different categories based on the degree of impact of each driver. The results showed that there is a spatial aggregation relationship between urban carbon dioxide emissions. High-high clusters mainly occur in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations, while low-low clusters occur in the central, western, and southwestern cities. Among all variables, freight volume, per capita gross domestic product, population density, and the proportion of secondary industries correlate positively with carbon dioxide emissions, whereas the number of buses per 10,000 people correlates negatively with carbon dioxide emissions. The geographically weighted regression model provided more detailed results and revealed the spatial heterogeneity of the effects of the different drivers. The impact of population, economic factors, and industrial factors in the eastern region is significantly greater than that in the central and western regions. Freight volume and public transport have the most significant impact in the northeast region. The clustering results showed that cities can be divided into four types. These findings provide a reference and policy suggestions for how cities in different regions should reduce carbon dioxide emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Chinese cities; Driving factors; Geographically weighted regression; Two-step cluster","Clustering algorithms; Global warming; Population statistics; Public policy; Regression analysis; Carbon dioxide emissions; Chinese cities; Driving factors; Geographically weighted regression; Two-step cluster; Carbon dioxide; autocorrelation; carbon emission; emission control; factor analysis; policy approach; regression analysis; spatial analysis; urban atmosphere; article; carbon footprint; China; city; driver; geographically weighted regression; gross national product; human; population density; river; spatial autocorrelation analysis; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; Yangtze Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066282884

While the carbon metabolism regulators are extensively studied, the regulation of enzyme production by the nitrogen metabolism regulators is still poorly understood. In this study, the GATA transcription factor Are1, which is an orthologue of the Aspergillus global nitrogen regulator AREA, was identified and characterized for its functions in regulation of both protease and cellulase production in T. reesei. Deletion of the are1 gene abolished the capability to secrete proteases, and complementation of the are1 gene rescued the ability to produce proteases. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcripts of protease genes apw1 and apw2 were also significantly reduced in the Dare1 strain when grown in the medium with peptone as the nitrogen source. In addition, deletion of are1 resulted in decreased cellulase production in the presence of (NH4)2SO4. Consistent with the reduction of cellulase production, the transcription levels of the major cellulase genes, including cbh1, cbh2, egl1, and egl2, were dramatically decreased in Dare1. Sequence analysis showed that all promoter regions of the tested protease and cellulase genes contain the consensus GATA elements. However, the expression levels of the major cellulase transcription activator Xyr1 and the repressor Cre1 had no significant difference between Dare1 and the parental strain QM9414, indicating that the regulatory mechanism deserves further investigation. Taken together, these results demonstrate the important role of Are1 in the regulation of protease and cellulase production in T. reesei, although these processes depend on the kind of nitrogen sources. The findings in this study contribute to the understanding of the regulation network of carbon and nitrogen sources in filamentous fungi. © 2019 by the authors.","Are1; Cellulase; GATA factors; Protease; Trichoderma reesei","cellulase; proteinase; scleroprotein; transcription factor GATA; cholesterol acyltransferase; peptide hydrolase; transcription factor; amino acid sequence; apw1 gene; apw2 gene; are1 gene; Article; Aspergillus niger; cbh1 gene; cbh2 gene; DNA sequence; DNA synthesis; egl1 gene; egl2 gene; enzyme activity; enzyme synthesis; gene; gene deletion; gene expression; genetic complementation; genetic distance; Hypocrea jecorina; nonhuman; open reading frame; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; protein expression; protein synthesis; protein synthesis regulation; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA-binding domain; skim milk; classification; extracellular space; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; phenotype; Trichoderma; Cellulases; Extracellular Space; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Peptide Hydrolases; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Sterol O-Acyltransferase; Transcription Factors; Trichoderma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071446612

The proposal presented is based on the good urban design planning practice offered by other cities that manage to preserve the air pollution level below an established limit. Firstly, the paper includes a literature review I carried out in order to study the latest scientific research papers related to the subject and the examples of good practice. Furthermore, the paper highlights the present situation in Bucharest generated by the high levels of air pollution and the need to reduce the toxic emissions. Romania has committed through Directive 2016/2284 of the European Parliament and of the Council to reduce the national emissions of certain pollutants. In addition, the proposal of update for GUP was developed according to the present national targets and to the specificity of the city, existing green space, tree density, small size surfaces. If the urban solution presented is applied through the General Urban Plan, the air quality in Bucharest will be considerably improved and the positive effects will not wait to appear in different perspectives, such as: Inhabitants' health condition, urban aesthetic, efficient use of the allocated budget for the improving air quality in the European capital. In order to successfully implement the urban solution, the present research has to be completed by an arboretum study in Bucharest.

After a period of quiescence, Sinabung activity resumed in 2013, producing frequent explosions, lava dome extrusion, and pyroclastic flows from dome and lava flow collapses, becoming one of the world's most active volcanoes and displacing over 20,000 citizens. This study presents a compilation of the geochemical datasets collected by the Indonesian Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM) from 2010–current (2016), which provides insights into the evolution of the eruption. Based on observations of SO2 emissions, ash componentry, ash leachate chemistry, and bulk ash geochemistry, the eruption can be split into six distinct geochemical phases. The initial stage of phreatic summit explosions (phase A) occurred from August–September 2010, during which background SO2 emissions averaged ~ 550 ± 180 t/d (1 s.d.). An eruptive pause (phase B) starting in October 2010 abruptly ended in September 2013 with a resumption of conduit-clearing eruptions (phase C). This third phase had a relatively modest background SO2 emission rate (avg. ~ 430 ± 310 t/d) and produced ash consisting of accidental ejecta with high S/Cl leachate molar ratios (12.0 ± 8.2, max 34), suggestive of deep-sourced magma and/or the incorporation of hydrothermal sulfur-bearing phases. Lava extrusion at the summit (phase D) began in mid-December 2013, and was accompanied by relatively low SO2 emission rates (360 ± 200 t/d) and lower, but variable, S/Cl leachate ratios (6.3 ± 8.5). The most intense phase of the eruption (phase E) occurred from mid-January to late February 2014 following a major lava dome collapse. This period included increased lava extrusion rates, dozens of large eruptions per day, high SO2 emission rates (average: 1680 ± 1070 t/d, peak: ~ 3800 t/d), and a dramatic drop in S/Cl ash leachates to ratios (average 1.4 ± 0.5), consistent with increased degassing from shallow magma and the clearing out of sulfurous phases from the old hydrothermal system. From March 2014 through the time of writing (September 2016), Sinabung settled into a relatively steady state of lower activity (phase F). Ash emissions now consist of dominantly juvenile andesitic-dacitic material with low S/Cl leachate ratios (average 1.1 ± 0.6). In August 2016, SO2 emissions started being measured in a continuous manner using a network of permanent scanning DOAS instruments. Background SO2 emission rates average 450 ± 290 t/d for the entirety of phase F, but have been progressively decreasing to an average of ~ 250–300 t/d since June 2016. This long-term gradual decline in SO2 emission rates at Sinabung since early 2014 is consistent with an apparent decrease in magma supply and lava effusion rates. Our conceptual degassing model suggests that large explosions and pyroclastic flows could continue in the near-term owing to conduit plugging and dome collapses, remaining a major threat until the magma supply rate decreases further and the eruption ends. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Ash geochemistry; Ash leachates; Continuous scanning DOAS; Sinabung Volcano; SO2 emissions","Degassing; Domes; Explosions; Extrusion; Geochemistry; Molar ratio; Particulate emissions; Volcanoes; Ash leachates; Continuous scanning; Geochemical datasets; Geological hazards; Hydrothermal system; Phreatic explosions; SO2 emissions; Sumatra , Indonesia; Gas emissions; carbon emission; dome; geochemistry; lava flow; magma; sulfur dioxide; sulfur emission; volcanic ash; volcanic eruption; Greater Sunda Islands; Mount Sinabung; North Sumatra; Sumatra; Sunda Isles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041179299

However, the pressure on automotive industry to reduce CO2 emissions in high efficient diesel applications results in lower exhaust gas temperatures. Therefore, it is highly needed to develop advanced vehicle thermal management methods to both fulfil the targets of emission standards and high thermal efficiency, without increasing dramatically the powertrain cost. The aim of this work is to experimentally demonstrate that by utilizing advanced engine and ATS control methods and revising the engine hardware and subsystems can lead to significant improvement on the fuel efficiency and emissions of the conventional diesel powertrain. The revised engine includes an improved combustion system, completely revised turbocharging and air handling system whilst being heavily reworked with respect to FMEP reduction. The aftertreatment employs a closed coupled electrically heated DOC, SCR on filter with an NH3 slip catalyst followed by an underfloor SCR and NH3 slip catalyst. The urea dosing system is utilizing double urea injection to maximize the overall performance. The complete engine and aftertreatment system is controlled by state of the art control system that can maximize the engine efficiency considering the performance of the aftertreatment system, this ensuring emissions compliance in challenging driving missions. The proposed powertrain was extensively tested on the engine dyno. Under steady state conditions, bsfc was improved by more than 15% compared to the reference LDCV diesel engine, while the bsfc area has been widely increased. The finalized powertrain was calibrated to reduce the tailpipe emissions by 50% compared to Euro 6 emission standards while fuel economy was improved by more than 7% compared to the current powertrain. The latter means that diesel powertrain can still be considered as a very effective and clean option due to the further uncovered potential. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

Recent efforts to improve solar heating codes in climate models focused on more accurate treatment of the absorption spectrum or fractional clouds. A mostly forgotten assumption in climate models is that of a flat Earth atmosphere. Spherical atmospheres intercept 2.5 W m-2 more sunlight and heat the climate by an additional 1.5 W m-2 globally. Such a systematic shift, being comparable to the radiative forcing change from preindustrial to present, is likely to produce a discernible climate shift that would alter a model's skill in simulating current climate. Regional heating errors, particularly at high latitudes, are several times larger. Unlike flat atmospheres, constituents in a spherical atmosphere, such as clouds and aerosols, alter the total amount of energy received by the Earth. To calculate the net cooling of aerosols in a spherical framework, one must count the increases in both incident and reflected sunlight, thus reducing the aerosol effect by 10 to 14% relative to using just the increase in reflected. Simple fixes to the current flat Earth climate models can correct much of this oversight, although some inconsistencies will remain. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Their significance changed over the centuries, similarly to the scale of the structures that were being built. All manners of escarpments, mounds and embankments functioned as integral elements of a visual, religious, sepulchral and commemorative significance within the landscape, in addition to constituting the basis of the compositions of garden and park layouts. In prehistory there appeared a tradition of the forming of artificial hills, examples of which were the most numerous in areas of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Scandinavia and central Europe (including, among other areas, Poland). During later periods, along with the disappearance of pagan cultures, the tendency had disappeared as well until the late Middle Ages, when earthen embankments were used, among other things, as tombs or in order to delineate the borders of landed estates. During the Renaissance and the Baroque the building of so-called parnassi (from the name Parnassus), which were garden mounds, gained in popularity. In modern times, in turn, mounds and other artificial embankments were erected mainly as monuments commemorating national heroes and important evens (e.g. the Kościuszko and PiŁsudski mounds in Krakow). Since the second half of the twentieth century landscape architects have often employed these types of spatial elements. This fascination with the use of earthworks-both for practical (e.g. waste treatment, reducing noise and air pollution), as well as artistic reasons-provides excellent effects in the spaces of cities. It AIDS in the individualisation of the landscape and of individual places, in building their identity and distinctness. Despite the fact that the reasons for using earthen forms in the landscape have been changing since ancient times all the way to the present, in many cases it is the symbolic value constitutes the overarching creative idea. This phenomenon has been presented in the article. Selected case studies, primarily from Europe and the United States of America, were analysed. The use of these forms throughout history has been presented-ranging from prehistoric geoglyphs or tombs, mounds used as monuments, e.g. those in Krakow, to contemporary layouts, e.g. the Vietnam Veterans Memorial by M. Lin, the Jacobs Javitz Plaza by M. Schwartz or the built projects by Ch. Jencks. The mutual correlations between structures built during different historical periods-for instance common archetypes or the idea of visual and spatial connections-is also an interesting problem. Elevating the landscape to the rank of a symbol causes space to gain an intangible value and provides visitors with new experiences. The placement of these types of structures within the contemporary landscape appears to be a beneficial measure making it possible to create not only a harmonious or beautiful space, but also one that has meaning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Embankments; Urban planning; Waste treatment; Creative ideas; Historical periods; Individualisation; Integral element; Landscape architects; Mutual correlations; Twentieth century; United States of America; Architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072976535

Modern ecological designs have smart solutions in planning climatic zones, with optimised natural lighting to lower energy use, and reduce wastage. Passive thermal comfort methods and spatial alignment of buildings to sun orientation have brought the ideals of organic architecture full circle since the ""sparse and scarce"" principles of technological design limitations guided vernacular urbanism over time. Today's modern buildings, abstracted from mass-produced designs, are shaped to trends and tastes, bringing attention to the artificial materiality of architectural forms and the hidden costs of innovations. To understand the relevance of sustainable strategies in developing critical regionalism, this paper reviews the scope of ecological architecture principles application for temperate climates, and examines the viability of strategies as passive cooling, thermal comfort and greenery-based ventilation. Through case study discussions of two Malaysian eco-architectural designers, Ken Yeang and Kevin Mark Low, it will also be argued that the spirit of nationalism and cultural regionalism can be integrated effectively into urban built forms. © 2020 Authors.","Ecological Architecture; Passive Design Strategies; Place-Making; Sustainable Design; Vernacular","Climatology; Ecodesign; Ecology; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Thermal comfort; Architectural designer; Design limitations; Ecological architecture; Passive design strategies; Place-Making; Spatial alignment; Sustainable strategies; Vernacular; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081623310

In this study, we present a limitation in the use of DPH to predict the order of lipid acyl chains when the lipid bilayer is doped with itraconazole (ITZ), an antifungal drug. Our steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed a significant decrease in fluorescence anisotropy of DPH embedded in the ITZ-containing membrane, suggesting a substantial increase in membrane fluidity, which indirectly indicates a decrease in the order of the hydrocarbon chains. This result or its interpretation is in disagreement with the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. The results of these experiments and calculations indicate an increase in the hydrocarbon chain order. The MD simulations of the bilayer containing both ITZ and DPH provide explanations for these observations. Apparently, in the presence of the drug, the DPH molecules are pushed deeper into the hydrophobic membrane core below the lipid double bonds, and the probe predominately adopts the orientation of the ITZ molecules that is parallel to the membrane surface, instead of orienting parallel to the lipid acyl chains. For this reason, DPH anisotropy provides information related to the less ordered central region of the membrane rather than reporting the properties of the upper segments of the lipid acyl chains. © 2019 The Authors","1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene; Fluorescence anisotropy; Lipid bilayers; Molecular dynamics simulations","1,6 diphenyl 1,3,5 hexatriene; fluorescent dye; hydrocarbon; itraconazole; 1,6 diphenyl 1,3,5 hexatriene; antifungal agent; fluorescent dye; phosphatidylcholine; anisotropy; Article; bilayer membrane; bleaching; fluorescence; hydrophobicity; lipid bilayer; membrane fluidity; molecular dynamics; priority journal; steady state; chemical phenomena; chemistry; fluorescence polarization; surface property; Antifungal Agents; Diphenylhexatriene; Fluorescence Polarization; Fluorescent Dyes; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Itraconazole; Lipid Bilayers; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Phosphatidylcholines; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067516562

The goal of these regulations is to improve the performance of Chilean cities regarding the three pillars of sustainability (social, economic and environmental). Santiago, as the capital of Chile and the focus of this research, has defined different methods to apply these regulations. However, this city still has challenges to implement them, such as environmental pollution, social segregation and the lack of economic and natural sources. There are different alternatives to overcome the challenges to implement the new sustainable housing guidelines in Santiago, one of them is to rethink the current density, high and sustainable solutions that the buildings have. The main objective of this paper is to describe and analyse the situation of the housing in Santiago considering the density, high-rise buildings with green guidelines and low carbon solutions as analysis parameters. The methodology established to achieve this objective is exploratory-descriptive with the literature review technique. The partial results illustrate that despite the benefits that represent the incorporation of new guidelines related to the increase in density and high-rise and low carbon solutions in housing projects of Santiago, it is important to consider that not all of these are applicable to this city. Each territory has its features (weather, culture, resources and norms), which determine the requirements that the projects need and the real possibilities to implement changes. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

When using satellite remote sensing to monitor climate impacts, such as drought stress on annual forage production, minimizing land management practices and disturbance effects sends a clear climate signal to the productivity data. This study investigates the effect of this climate signal by: (1) providing spatial estimates of expected biomass under specific climate conditions, (2) determining which drought indices explain the majority of interannual variability in this biomass, and (3) developing a predictive model that estimates the annual biomass early in the growing season. To address objective 1, this study uses an established methodology to determine Expected Ecosystem Performance (EEP) in the Nebraska Sandhills, US, representing annual forage levels after accounting for non-climatic influences. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data were used to approximate actual ecosystem performance. Seventeen years (2000-2016) of annual EEP was calculated using piecewise regression tree models of site potential and climate data. Expected biomass (EB), EEP converted to biomass in kg*ha-1*yr-1, was then used to examine the predictive capacity of several drought indices and the onset date of the growing season. Subsets of these indices were used to monitor and predict annual expected grassland biomass. Independent field-based biomass production data available from two Sandhills locations were used for validation of the EEP model. The EB was related to field-based biomass production (R2 = 0.66 and 0.57) and regional rangeland productivity statistics of the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) dataset. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), the 3- and 6-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), which represented moisture conditions during May, June and July, explained the majority of the interannual biomass variability in this grassland system (three-month ESI explained roughly 72% of the interannual biomass variability). A new model was developed to use drought indices from early in the growing season to predict the total EB for the whole growing season. This unique approach considers only climate-related drought signal on productivity. The capability to estimate annual EB by the end of May will potentially enable land managers to make informed decisions about stocking rates, hay purchase needs, and other management issues early in the season, minimizing their potential drought losses. © 2019 by the authors.","Biomass prediction; Drought; EMODIS NDVI; Forage production; Rangeland productivity; Remote sensing; Rule-based piecewise regression tree; Sandhills","Biomass; Drought; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Forestry; Land use; Productivity; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Trees (mathematics); EMODIS NDVI; Forage production; Land management practices; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Normalized difference vegetation index datum; Piecewise regression; Sandhills; Standardized precipitation index; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072644515

More than 4800 historical Calanus spp. water column integrated samples as well as 221 vertically stratified sampling stations were used to create a 3D (latitude, longitude and vertical) climatology of Calanus spp. biomass densities for spring and summer-fall when NARW are feeding in Canadian waters. We then combined this 3D preyscape with bio-energetic considerations to highlight potentially suitable NARW foraging habitats in the region. Our 3D climatological approach successfully identified the known feeding areas of Grand Manan (BoF) and Roseway Basin (western SS), confirming its validity. Expanding our analyses to the GSL and other parts of the SS, we identified in both regions areas previously unknown where Calanus spp. biomass densities exceeded minimum levels suitable for foraging NARW.

In fertilized agricultural croplands and grasslands there is usually more emission than deposition especially in midday during warmer seasons. In North America, most of the ammonia emissions are from agriculture with a significant fraction of that coming from fertilizer. A new bidirectional ammonia flux modeling system has been developed in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, which has close linkages with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agricultural ecosystem model. Daily inputs from EPIC are used to calculate soil ammonia concentrations that are combined with air concentrations in CMAQ to calculate bidirectional surface flux. The model is evaluated against surface measurements of NH3 concentrations, NH4 + and SO4 2− aerosol concentrations, NH4 + wet deposition measurements, and satellite retrievals of NH3 concentrations. The evaluation shows significant improvement over the base model without bidirectional ammonia flux. Comparisons to monthly average satellite retrievals show similar spatial distribution with the highest ammonia concentrations in the Central Valley of California (CA), the Snake River valley in Idaho, and the western High Plains. In most areas the model underestimates, but in the Central Valley of CA, it generally overestimates ammonia concentration. Case study analyses indicate that modeled high fluxes of ammonia in CA are often caused by anomalous high soil ammonia loading from EPIC for particular crop types. While further improvements to parameterizations in EPIC and CMAQ are recommended, this system is a significant advance over previous ammonia bidirectional surface flux models. ©2019.

However, considering the peculiarities of the dense European cities, most of the available surfaces in urban areas are the perimeter walls of buildings of considerable age that are in urgent need of measures to upgrade their energy performance. Based on this premise, this paper investigates the potential for CO2 storage resulting from the application of energy retrofit solutions using biogenic insulating materials. Starting from the analysis of the demand for insulation materials necessary for the energy requalification of the residential existing building stock in 28 European countries, following the renovation target fixed by EU, the research analyses, through the adoption of a dynamic LCA approach, the environmental benefits of bio-based materials compared to traditional solutions. The use of these materials, especially if they are fast-growing - as the study shows - offers several advantages in terms of climate change mitigation by reducing the energy needs and CO2 emissions of the existing building stock and increasing carbon storage capacity within cities. The results of this study are intended to provide a robust database on which to build a model of circular building renovation that takes into account the environmental long-term effects of measures for increasing energy efficiency of buildings. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The sustainability of wood as a construction material is a complex issue since the environmental impacts are strongly related to forest management, service life and, finally, to end-of-life scenarios and waste treatment processes. In this study, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) comparison was carried out between a semi-detached house out of cross-laminated timber (CLT) and a conventional building with similar geometric characteristics and equal thermal performance (U-value), out of light-clay bricks with a reinforced concrete structure. Particularly, the environmental impacts from raw materials supply, transportation and product processing (cradle to gate) were investigated and the Recipe mid-point method was adopted for the impact assessment to compare the environmental burdens of the two equivalent buildings. The positive environmental values resulted in the massive timber building are mainly connected to the replacement of the reinforced concrete mass used in the structure. The outcome, in terms of global warming potential, show that the use of wood as a building material instead of conventional materials results in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of roughly 25%. This material replacement, if extended on a large scale, could give a valid contribution on achieving the community goals of reducing emissions from the construction sector. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Member States may use modelling, combined with measurements, to “assess” current levels of air quality and estimate future air quality under different scenarios. In case of current and potential exceedances of the Directive limit values, it is also requested that they “plan” and implement emission reductions measures to avoid future exceedances. In both “assessment” and “planning”, air quality models can and should be used; but to do so, the used modelling chain has to be fit-for-purpose and properly checked and verified. FAIRMODE has developed in the recent years a suite of methodologies and tools to check if emission inventories, model performance, source apportionment techniques and planning activities are fit-for-purpose. Within the “FAIRMODE pilot”, these tools are used and tested by regional/local authorities, with the two-fold objective of improving management practices at regional/local scale, and providing valuable feedback to the FAIRMODE community. Results and lessons learnt from this activity are presented in this paper, as a showcase that can potentially benefit other authorities in charge of air quality assessment and planning. © 2019 The Authors",,"air quality; atmospheric modeling; emission inventory; environmental management; environmental planning; future prospect; scenario analysis; source apportionment; air quality; article; human; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066436692

Thus, the improvement of knowledge on the effect of conservation practices, related to tillage and N fertilization, on soil microbial communities is critical to better understand the role and function of microorganisms in regulating agro-ecosystems. In the Mediterranean area, vulnerable to climate change and suffering for management-induced losses of soil fertility, the impact of conservation practices on soil microbial communities is of special interest for building mitigation and adaptation strategies to climate change. A long-term experiment, originally designed to investigate the effect of tillage and N fertilization on crop yield and soil organic carbon, was utilized to understand the effect of these management practices on soil prokaryotic and fungal community diversity. The majority of prokaryotic and fungal taxa were common to all treatments at both soil depths, whereas few bacterial taxa (Cloacimonates, Spirochaetia and Berkelbacteria) and a larger number of fungal taxa (i.e., Coniphoraceae, Debaryomycetaceae, Geastraceae, Cordicypitaceae and Steccherinaceae) were unique to specific management practices. Soil prokaryotic and fungal structure was heavily influenced by the interaction of tillage and N fertilization: the prokaryotic community structure of the fertilized conventional tillage system was remarkably different respect to the unfertilized conservation and conventional systems in the surface layer. In addition, the effect of N fertilization in shaping the fungal community structure of the surface layer was higher under conservation tillage systems than under conventional tillage systems. Soil microbial community was shaped by soil depth irrespective of the effect of plowing and N addition. Finally, chemical and enzymatic parameters of soil and crop yields were significantly related to fungal community structure along the soil profile. The findings of this study gave new insights on the identification of management practices supporting and suppressing beneficial and detrimental taxa, respectively. This highlights the importance of managing soil microbial diversity through agro-ecological intensified systems in the Mediterranean area. © Copyright © 2019 Piazza, Ercoli, Nuti and Pellegrino.","16S rRNA; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Glomeromycota; Illumina sequencing; ITS1 region; soil archaea; soil bacteria; soil fungi","alpha glucosidase; ammonia; arylsulfatase; beta glucosidase; cellulose; chitinase; leucine; nitrate; nitrogen; organic carbon; RNA 16S; xylan 1,4 beta xylosidase; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; agricultural procedures; agroecosystem; Article; Ascomycetes; Bacteroidetes; Basidiomycetes; bioinformatics; Chloroflexi; Chytridiomycetes; climate change; conservation tillage; crop production; DNA extraction; environmental protection; Firmicutes; fungal community; fungal diversity; fungal structures; Glomeromycota; microbial community; microbial diversity; Microbotryomycetes; Mortierellomycota; mycorrhiza; next generation sequencing; nitrogen fertilization; nonhuman; nutrient cycling; phylogenetic tree; physical chemistry; Plantomycetes; polymerase chain reaction; Proteobacteria; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; soil change; soil chemistry; soil depth; soil fertility; soil fertilization; soil microflora; soybean; Thaumarchaeota; Triticum aestivum; Verrucomicrobia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072893398

This means that buildings will produce, on an annual basis, more energy than they will consume. The design of the new building for the School of Engineering, Faculty of Exact Sciences, Engineering and Surveying, National University of Rosario, Argentina, is given as an example of this kind of building. The building techniques applied in this design include: autoclaved aerated concrete in walls and insulation thermal roof panels, high energy and water consumption efficiency, photovoltaic power supply and sensors/dataloggers and actuators placed in the main equipment and sites. With these technological improvements, several analyses yielded reductions of 70%, in comparison with conventional buildings. Regarding the energy consumption of the facility, this is estimated at 29620 KWh/year, resulting in an energy intensity of about 25.7 KWh/(m2year). The energy annually produced by the PV plant (58491 KWh/year) exceeds what is required, which makes the facility a positive energy building in +49.4%, being this surplus exported to the National Electrical Interconnected System. The positive (clean) energy building implies that it avoids the emission to the atmosphere of a given quantity of greenhouse gases, in the present case 20647 TnCO2eq. In this way, through a comprehensive design of buildings, the construction sector can collaborate on the global contamination reduction and, consequently, global warming mitigation. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

A key aspect of plant phenology is the timing of root production, how it coincides with canopy development and subsequent water-use. The timing of these events within species and across communities could influence the invasion process. We examined above- and belowground phenology of two species in southern California, the native shrub, Adenostoma fasciculatum, and the invasive perennial grass, Ehrharta calycina to investigate relative differences in phenology and water use. Methods: We used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to track whole-canopy activity across the landscape and sap flux sensors on individual chaparral shrubs to assess differences in aboveground phenology of both species. To determine differences in belowground activity, we used soil moisture sensors, minirhizotron imagery, and stable isotopes. Results: The invasive grass depleted soil moisture earlier in the spring and produced longer roots at multiple depths earlier in the growing season than the native shrub. However, Adenostoma fasciculatum produced longer roots in the top 10 cm of soil profile in May. Aboveground activity of the two species peaked at the same time. Conclusions: The fact that Ehrharta calycina possessed longer roots earlier in the season suggests that invasive plants may gain a competitive edge over native plants through early activity, while also depleting soil moisture earlier in the season. Depletion of soil moisture earlier by E. calycina suggests that invasive grasses could accelerate the onset of the summer drought in chaparral systems, assuring their persistence following invasion. © 2019 The Authors.

Given these issues, some researchers have used domesticated dogs as human dietary proxies via the Canine Surrogacy Approach (CSA). We performed carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis on the hair of 304 humans and 57 dogs from 45 households in two contemporary indigenous communities in Nicaragua's Bosawas Biosphere Reserve to explore whether dogs function as dietary proxies for their human owners in this Neotropical horticulturalist context. While CSA is broadly viable at these study sites, on a more precise scale the diets of dogs do not reflect the diets of their owners. This raises questions about the applicability of CSA to archaeological contexts, suggesting that relying on dogs as dietary proxies may overlook key variation in past human diets. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Bayesian inference; Canine surrogacy approach; Dogs; Ethnoarchaeology; Nicaragua; Stable isotope analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065843038

In this paper, monthly and annual climate normals of sea ice parameters (concentration, area, and extent) of the whole Arctic Ocean and 15 regional divisions are derived for the period of 1981–2010 using monthly satellite sea ice concentration estimates from a climate data record (CDR) produced by NOAA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Basic descriptions and characteristics of the normals are provided. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has been utilized to describe spatial modes of sea ice concentration variability and how the corresponding principal components change over time. To provide users with basic information on data product accuracy and uncertainty, the climate normal values of Arctic sea ice extents (SIE) are compared with that of other products, including a product from NSIDC and two products from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). The SIE differences between different products are in the range of 2.3–4.5% of the CDR SIE mean. Additionally, data uncertainty estimates are represented by using the range (the difference between the maximum and minimum), standard deviation, 10th and 90th percentiles, and the first, second, and third quartile distribution of all monthly values, a distinct feature of these sea ice normal products. © 2019 by the authors.

Electricity market regulation and climatic conditions, in particular solar radiation, are the main factors that determine the economic viability of a photovoltaic facility. This paper describes a method for evaluating the potential for photovoltaic (PV) production and self-consumption for the building stock of a particular city. A GIS 3D city map is used to calculate solar irradiation. Building-level electricity use is calculated based on building type, geometry and other characteristic inferred from building age, taking the cadastre GIS as main input. The methodology identifies the realistic potential for rooftop photovoltaic installations, as well as the optimum size to be installed from an economic perspective. To represent different regulations that can affect economic viability of PV installations, calculations should adapt for the specific installation conditions and regulatory situation, as for example self-consumption and net metering. The proposed methodology is applied to a case study in Irun (Spain), where results for potential of PV generation and self-consumption for the building stock are presented. The results offer public administration a realistic view of economically viable PV potential for the city and allow to analyse different mechanisms to promote their installations. It also serves for individual electricity consumers to evaluate and optimize new photovoltaic energy facilities. Finally, it serves policy makers to estimate the repercussion of electricity market regulations on the economic viability of PV systems. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

This often requires changes in institutions, which can be difficult to realize. Explicitly process-oriented approaches explaining how and why institutional change occurs are lacking. Overcoming this gap is vital to move beyond either input-oriented (e.g., capacity) or output-oriented (e.g., assessment) approaches, to understand how changes actually occur for addressing complex and contested governance issues. This paper analyses causal conditions and mechanisms by which institutions develop in climate adaptation governance. It focuses on urban climate governance through an in-depth case study of Santiago, Chile, over a 12-year period (2005–2017), drawing on primary and secondary data, including 26 semistructured interviews with policy, academic, and civil society actors. It identifies and explains a variety of institutional developments across multiple levels (i.e., programmatic, legislative, and constitutional), through a theory-centric process tracing methodology. This reveals a multiple-response pattern, involving several causal mechanisms and coexisting institutional logics. Findings suggest that although adaptation may be inherently protracted, institutions can nevertheless develop in both related and novel directions. Overall, the paper argues for a new research agenda on process-oriented theorizing and analysis in climate and environmental governance. © 2019 The Authors Environmental Policy and Governance published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Chile; climate governance; governance adaptation; gradual change; institutional dynamics; institutions; transformation","adaptation; climate change; governance approach; input-output analysis; institutional framework; Chile; Metropolitana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073642780

They set up standards and commitments, provide funding, create and disseminate information, and execute projects on the ground. As part of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) decided to implement the ‘Sharm El-Sheikh to Beijing Action Agenda for Nature and People’. While there is general support for a voluntary commitment process, the question now is how the Action agenda should look like, what form voluntary commitments for biodiversity should take and if and how the action agenda could become a meaningful pillar in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. A recent study by the authors reveals the actual depth and breadth of biodiversity governance beyond the CBD.

This paper aims to explore the quality of GHG disclosures by cities via the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and compares them with the expectations of users. Design/methodology/approach: The expectation gap framework is used to examine the GHG disclosure quality of 42 cities. User expectations are determined via a literature review and CDP documentation. City disclosures are reviewed using content analysis. Findings: GHG information at the city level is outdated, incomplete, inconsistent, inaccurate and incomparable and, therefore, to meet user expectations, improvement is needed. Research limitations/implications: The findings have implications for policymakers, stakeholders and managers. Guidelines are required for better disclosure of GHG information relating to cities, and stakeholders need to develop better skills to understand emissions information. Managers have a responsibility to measure, disclose and mitigate GHG emissions to meet the expectations of stakeholders. Originality/value: Prior studies focus on GHG disclosures via the CDP by corporations. This is the first accounting study to examine GHG disclosures by cities via the CDP. The expectation gap framework is a novel approach to sustainability disclosure research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon; Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP); City; Disclosure; Emission; Expectation gap; GHG",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068413544

A common assumption in the causal inference literature in the presence of interference is partial interference, implying that the population can be partitioned in clusters of individuals whose potential outcomes only depend on the treatment of units within the same cluster. Previous literature has defined average potential outcomes under counterfactual scenarios where treatments are randomly allocated to units within a cluster. However, within clusters there may be units that are more or less likely to receive treatment based on covariates or neighbors’ treatment. We define new estimands that describe average potential outcomes for realistic counterfactual treatment allocation programs, extending existing estimands to take into consideration the units’ covariates and dependence between units’ treatment assignment. We further propose entirely new estimands for population-level interventions over the collection of clusters, which correspond in the motivating setting to regulations at the federal (vs. cluster or regional) level. We discuss these estimands, propose unbiased estimators and derive asymptotic results as the number of clusters grows. For a small number of observed clusters, a bootstrap approach for confidence intervals is proposed.

We have investigated the morphological changes occurring at the metal–polymer interface in ML structures with varying volume fraction of gold (Au) and the kinetic growth aspect of the microscale properties of nano-sized Au in plasma polymer fluorocarbon (PPFC). Investigations were carried out at various temperatures and annealing times by means of grazing incidence small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS and GIWAXS). We have fabricated a series of MLs with varying volume fraction (0.12, 0.27, 0.38) of Au and bilayer periodicity in ML structure. They show an interesting granular structure consisting of nearly spherical nanoparticles within the polymer layer. The nanoparticle (NP) morphology changes due to the collective effects of NPs diffusion within ensembles in the in-plane vicinity and interlayer with increasing temperature. The in-plane NPs size distinctly increases with increasing temperature. The NPs become more spherical, thus reducing the surface energy. Linear growth of NPs with temperature and time shows diffusion-controlled growth of NPs in the ML structure. The structural stability of the multilayer is controlled by the volume ratio of the metal in polymer. At room temperature, UV-Vis shows a blue shift of the plasmon peak from 560 nm in ML Au/PTFE_1 to 437 nm in Au/PTFE_3. We have identified the fabrication and postdeposition annealing conditions to limit the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) shift from ΔλLSPR = 180 nm (Au/PTFE_1) to ΔλLSPR = 67 nm (Au/PTFE_3 ML)) and their optical response over a wide visible wavelength range. A variation in the dielectric constant of the polymer in presence of varying Au inclusion is found to be a possible factor affecting the LSPR frequency. Our findings may provide insights in nanoengineering of ML structure that can be useful to systematically control the growth of NPs in polymer matrix. © 2019 by the authors.

Further, assessment of biomass, carbon stock, and its spatial distribution is prerequisite for monitoring the health of forest ecosystem. Moreover, vegetation field inventories are valuable source of data for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB), density, and the carbon stored in biomass of forest vegetation. In view of the importance of biomass, the present study makes an attempt to estimate temporal AGB of Tripura State, India, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and the field inventory data through geospatial techniques. A model was developed for establishing the relationship between biomass, LAI, and NDVI in the selected study site. The study also aimed to improve method for quantifying and verifying inventory-based biomass stock estimation. The results demonstrate the correlation value obtained between LAI and NDVI were 0.87 and 0.53 for the years 2011 and 2014, respectively. The correlation value between estimated AGB with LAI were found as 0.66 and 0.69, while with NDVI, the values were obtained as 0.64 and 0.94 for the years 2011 and 2014, respectively. The regression model of measured biomass with MODIS NDVI and LAI was developed for the data obtained during the period 2011–2014. The developed model was used to estimate the spatial distribution of biomass and its relationship between LAI and NDVI. The R2 values obtained were 0.832 for estimated and the measured AGB during the training and 0.826 for the validation. The results indicate that the methodology adopted in this study can help in selecting best fit model for analyzing relationship between AGB and NDVI/LAI and for estimating biomass using allometric equation at various spatial scales. The developed output thematic map showed an average biomass distribution of 32–94 Mg ha−1. The highest biomass values (72–95 Mg ha −1) was confined to the dense region of the forest while the lowest biomass values (32–46 Mg ha−1) was identified in the outer regions of the study site. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biomass; Field inventory; LAI; LAI; MODIS; NDVI; Regression model","Carbon; Ecosystems; Forestry; Maps; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Spatial distribution; Vegetation; Biomass distribution; Field inventories; Geospatial techniques; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; Regression model; Biomass; aboveground biomass; carbon sequestration; climate variation; forest dynamics; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; leaf area index; MODIS; NDVI; regression analysis; remote sensing; spatial distribution; aboveground biomass; Article; biomass; canopy; carbon sequestration; case study; controlled study; field inventory; geographic distribution; humidity; India; information processing; monsoon climate; remote sensing; seasonal variation; vegetation; environmental monitoring; forest; plant; plant leaf; procedures; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; India; Tripura; Biomass; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; India; Plant Leaves; Plants; Remote Sensing Technology; Satellite Imagery; Spatial Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071495827

Three emission scenarios were considered: (1) a projected business-as-usual socioeconomic growth with freight fleet turnover and stringent emission control (CTR); (2) the application of a carbon pricing climate policy (PO); and (3) further technology improvements to eliminate high-emitting conditions in the truck fleet (NS). The PO and NS cases are superimposed on the CTR case. Using a WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ-BenMAP modeling framework, we quantified the impacts of diesel fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions change on air quality, health, and economic benefits. In the CTR case, we simulate a widespread reduction of PM2.5 concentrations, between 0.5 and 1.5 μg m−3, comparing to a base year of 2011. This translates into health benefits of 3600 (95% CI: 2400–4800) prevented premature deaths, corresponding to $38 (95% CI: $3.5–$100) billion. Compared to CTR case, the PO case can obtain ~9% more health benefits nationally, however, climate policy also affects the health outcomes regionally due to transition of demand from truck to rail; regions with fewer trucks could gain in health benefits, while regions with added rail freight may potentially experience a loss in health benefits due to air quality degradation. The NS case provides substantial additional benefits (~20%). These results support that a combination of continuous adoption of stringent emission standards and strong improvements in vehicle technology are necessary, as well as rewarding, to meet the sustainable freight and community health goals. States and metropolitan areas with high population density and usually high freight demand and emissions can take more immediate actions, such as accelerating vehicle technology improvements and removing high-emitting trucks, to improve air quality and health benefits. © 2019","Air quality; Diesel emissions; Freight transportation; Particulate matter; Public health","Air quality; Automobiles; Diesel engines; Economics; Emission control; Fleet operations; Health risks; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Population statistics; Public health; Smoke; Truck transportation; Trucks; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Diesel emission; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); High population density; In-vehicle technology; Particulate Matter; PM2.5 concentration; Rail freight transportations; Technology improvement; Freight transportation; air quality; diesel; environmental economics; freight transport; health impact; particulate matter; railway transport; sustainability; traffic emission; transportation planning; transportation technology; trucking; air pollution control; air quality; air quality standard; Article; controlled study; death; environmental policy; exhaust gas; health hazard; mathematical model; particulate matter; priority journal; traffic and transport; United States; air pollutant; air pollution; case control study; chemistry; exhaust gas; forecasting; human; longitudinal study; motor vehicle; railway; theoretical model; United States; carbon; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon; Case-Control Studies; Forecasting; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Models, Theoretical; Motor Vehicles; Particulate Matter; Railroads; United States; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067311201

The results showed that the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the rainy season + irrigation period and dry season + non-irrigation period increased with the increase of the scale. The total nitrogen and total phosphorus load per unit area in the rainy season + irrigation period decreased with the increase of the scale; the dry season + non-irrigation period increased slightly. The same nitrogen and phosphorus index concentration was significantly different at different spatial scales. The main reason for the scale effect was the distribution pattern of land-use. Affected by this, scale D, the critical scale of nitrogen and phosphorus load in Jingui river watershed, its average load of total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, total phosphorus and total dissolved phosphate reached the highest value of the watershed. The contribution rate of nitrogen and phosphorus load in rainy season + irrigation period and dry season + non-irrigation period of research areas with different area depends on precipitation and the distribution pattern of land-use. Therefore, the nitrogen and phosphorus emission control and pollutant reduction in the rice irrigation districts of Lijiang river basin should consider the spatial-temporal features and effects of nitrogen and phosphorus pollutant transport. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Drought; Emission control; Hydraulic structures; Hydraulics; Irrigation; Land use; Nitrogen; Rivers; Shore protection; Watersheds; Contribution rate; Dissolved phosphates; Distribution patterns; Irrigation period; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Nitrogen and phosphorus loss; Pollutant transport; Spatial-temporal features; River pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072987020

The aim is to provide a tool for capturing and addressing deep-rooted behavioral and institutional preferences that may aggravate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in cities. Socio-economic activities, land use change, and future urban forms are considered and forecast to the year 2040 on 30m × 30m spatial grids. GHG emissions associated with these urban development aspects are calculated and compared between the cities. Innovative policy instruments for growth control and zoning (GCZ) are simulated and tested through the socio-ecological model, to determine their effectiveness when added to other interventions included in the CAPs. Our findings show that behavioral/institutional preference for sprawl, its low-density form, and resultant carbon sink losses are main factors driving current and future residential and transportation GHG emissions in Chicago. GCZ policies are shown to counteract and mitigate around 20% of these factors in the form of future GHG emissions. © 2019 The Authors","Climate action planning; Comparative urban study; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land use; Socio-ecological modeling; Urban planning","Ecology; Economics; Gas emissions; Land use; Urban growth; Urban planning; Action planning; Driving current; Land-use change; Policy instruments; Socio-ecological; Socio-economics; Urban development; Urban studies; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066984037

Biodiversity studies have shown that such changed drought stress may be mitigated by plant species richness. Here, we investigate if grassland communities, differing in species richness, respond differently to climatic extremes within the growing season. In a 3-year outdoor mesocosm experiment, four grassland species in both monoculture and mixture were subjected to a rainfall distribution regime with two levels: periods of severe drought in the summer intermitted by extreme rainfall events versus regular rainfall over time. Both treatments received the same amount of water over the season. Extreme rainfall combined with drought periods resulted in a 15% decrease in aboveground biomass in the second and third year, compared to the regular rainfall regime. Root biomass was also reduced in the extreme rainfall treatment, particularly in the top soil layer (− 40%). All species developed higher water use efficiencies (less negative leaf δ13C) in extreme rainfall than in regular rainfall. These responses to the rainfall/drought treatment were independent of species richness, although the mixtures were on an average more productive in terms of biomass than the monocultures. Our experimental results suggest that mixtures are similarly able to buffer these within-season rainfall extremes than monocultures, which contrasts with findings in the studies on natural droughts. Our work demonstrates the importance of investigating the interactions between rainfall distribution and drought periods for understanding effects of climate change on plant community performance. © 2019, The Author(s).","Biodiversity; Climate change; Drought; Overyielding; Resistance; Roots; Stability","aboveground biomass; biodiversity; biomass; climate change; climate modeling; drought; drought stress; extreme event; global climate; grassland; growing season; monoculture; plant community; rainfall; root system; species richness; biodiversity; biomass; climate change; drought; grassland; plant; Biodiversity; Biomass; Climate Change; Droughts; Grassland; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070256279

Using a mixed approach, the study details the effects of the El Nino on rainy season characteristics, particularly, rainfall amounts and distribution, onset and cessation of rains, duration of the rainy season and total seasonal rainfall and how it impacted smallholder maize production. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a mixed method approach in collecting and analyzing data. For stronger evidence building, (Creswell, 2013) the authors combined interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) to collect the qualitative data. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered to extension officers, management information system officers and other relevant personnel of the Ministry of Agriculture in the three municipalities. Six FGD’s were held for maize farmers in six communities in all three municipalities. Findings: The study shows that the 2015 El Nino had dire consequences on farm yields, subsequently affecting farmer’s incomes and livelihoods. The study further finds that complex socio-cultural factors, some unrelated to the El Nino, aggravated the effects on maize farmers. These include the lack of adequate climatic information, predominance of rain-fed farming, a lack of capacity to adapt and existing levels of poverty. Originality/value: The study recommends inter alia, appropriate use of seasonal rainfall forecasting to enhance better farming decision-making and the development of elaborate climate variability interventions by national and local agencies. © 2019, Kwadwo Owusu, Ayisi Kofi Emmanuel, Issah Justice Musah-Surugu and Paul William Kojo Yankson.","Adaptation; Climate variability; El Nino; Ghana; Rainfall","agrometeorology; climate effect; ecological zonation; El Nino; maize; precipitation intensity; questionnaire survey; rainfed agriculture; smallholder; state role; Brong-Ahafo; Ghana; Techiman; Wenchi; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064003825

First, the Arctic is already changing rapidly as a result of climate change. Contemporary warm Arctic temperatures and large sea ice deficits (75% volume loss) demonstrate climate states outside of previous experience. Modeled changes of the Arctic cryosphere demonstrate that even limiting global temperature increases to near 2 °C will leave the Arctic a much different environment by mid-century with less snow and sea ice, melted permafrost, altered ecosystems, and a projected annual mean Arctic temperature increase of +4 °C. Second, even under ambitious emission reduction scenarios, high-latitude land ice melt, including Greenland, are foreseen to continue due to internal lags, leading to accelerating global sea level rise throughout the century. Third, future Arctic changes may in turn impact lower latitudes through tundra greenhouse gas release and shifts in ocean and atmospheric circulation. Arctic-specific radiative and heat storage feedbacks may become an obstacle to achieving a stabilized global climate. In light of these trends, the precautionary principle calls for early adaptation and mitigation actions. © 2018 The Authors","2 °C limit; Arctic; Climate projections; Cryosphere; Global change; Sea ice","air temperature; atmospheric circulation; climate change; cryosphere; emission control; global change; global climate; oceanic circulation; sea ice; sea level change; trend analysis; Arctic; Greenland",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063620785

There have been few comprehensive assessments of recovery following restoration in fragmented forest landscapes, and the efficacy of active versus passive (i.e., natural regeneration) restoration remains unclear. We examined 11 indicators of forest structure, tree diversity and composition (adult and sapling), and aboveground carbon storage in 25 pairs of actively restored (AR; 7–15 yr after weed removal and mixed-native tree species planting) and naturally regenerating (NR) plots within degraded rainforest fragments, and in 17 less-disturbed benchmark (BM) rainforest plots in the Western Ghats, India. We assessed the effects of active restoration on the 11 indicators and tested the hypothesis that the effects of active restoration increase with isolation from contiguous and relatively intact rainforests. Active restoration significantly increased canopy cover, adult tree and sapling density, adult and sapling species density (overall and late-successional), compositional similarity to benchmarks, and aboveground carbon storage, which recovered 14–82% toward BM targets relative to NR baselines. By contrast, tree height–diameter ratios and the proportion of native saplings did not recover consistently in actively restored forests. The effects of active restoration on canopy cover, species density (adult), late-successional species density (adult and sapling), and species composition, but not carbon storage, increased with isolation across the fragmented landscape. Our findings show that active restoration can promote recovery of forest structure, composition, and carbon storage within 7–15 yr of restoration in degraded tropical rainforest fragments, although the benefits of active over passive restoration across fragmented landscapes would depend on indicator type and may increase with site isolation. These findings on early stages of recovery suggest that active restoration in ubiquitous fragmented landscapes of the tropics could complement passive restoration of degraded forests in less fragmented landscapes, and protection of intact forests, as a key strategy for conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. © 2019 The Authors.","carbon storage; climate change mitigation; conservation; ecological restoration; forest recovery; natural regeneration; tree diversity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073204928

Thus, early detection of deforestation processes is of paramount importance. Motivated by this scenario, this work presents an evaluation of methods for automatic deforestation detection, specifically Early Fusion (EF) Convolutional Network, Siamese Convolutional Network (S-CNN) and the well-known Support Vector Machine (SVM), taken as the baseline. These methods were evaluated in a region of the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA). Two Landsat 8 images acquired in 2016 and 2017 were used in our experiments. The impact of training set size was also investigated. The Deep Learning-based approaches clearly outperformed the SVM baseline in our approaches, both in terms of F1-score and Overall Accuracy, with a superiority of S-CNN over EF. © 2019 ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper undertook literature review of secondary data sources, conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs). The statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze data for the quantitative part of the paper. Findings: Vulnerability is influenced by age, gender, education and disability. Elderly women are considered to be the most vulnerable to climate variability and change because they are the poorest in the community, followed by elderly men, the disabled, female-headed households, married women, men and, finally, the youth. Less than 30 per cent of women and men in both Katilu and Loima are able to read and write. The cross-tabulation results show that there is a statistical significant relationship between gender, age and education level and climate change vulnerability. This implies that gender, age and education level have a significant effect on climate change vulnerability. Research limitations/implications: The research coverage was limited to only two regions in Turkana because of time and economic constraints. Practical implications: The lack of attention to gender in the climate change literature has time and again resulted in an oversimplification of women’s and men's experience of climate risks. Improved development assistance, investments and enhanced targeting of the truly vulnerable within pastoral societies demand an acceptance of underdevelopment in arid and semi-arid regions in Kenya because of historical imbalances in investment; the recognition that vulnerability of pastoralists is neither uniform nor universal and the need to consider differences like age, gender and education. Policy-makers should understand that pastoralists in the past have used indigenous knowledge to cope with and adapt to climate change. The current-recurrent and intensity droughts require investment in modern technology, equipping pastoralists with relevant information and skills to make them resilient to climate change and implementing existing and relevant policies for northern Kenya. Social implications: This paper draws from several other efforts to show the critical relationships between gender, social capital and climate change. They are tracking adaptation and measuring development framework; ending drought emergencies common programme framework; and feminist evaluation approach.

This entails the development of assessment methods and metrics as plans are drafted and actions implemented. To this end, this paper explores the concept of credibility as a critical issue in climate policy and develops an Adaptation Policy Credibility (APC) conceptual and operational assessment framework for helping to allocate public funding and private investments, and for implementing and catalysing climate policy. Through a pilot testing in four early-adopting cities (Copenhagen, Durban, Quito and Vancouver), a clear potential for large-n tracking and assessment exercises of local climate adaptation plans is envisaged. The APC approach might also be useful to guide individual cities that aim to improve their adaptation planning and policy-making processes. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Conventional passenger cars are operated mainly in lower part loads for most of their lifetime. Under these conditions, oil temperatures are far below the maximum temperature allowed and dominate inside the journal bearings. Therefore, the objective of this research was to investigate possible potentials of friction reduction by optimizing the combustion engine's thermal management of the oil circuit. Within the engine investigations, it was shown that especially the friction of the main and connecting rod bearings could be reduced with an increase of the oil supply temperature. Furthermore, on a journal bearing test rig, it was shown that no excessive wear of the bearings is to be expected in case of load increase and simultaneous supply of cooler oil. In addition to the test investigations, MBS-(T)EHL simulation models were built up to investigate the behavior of the crankshaft bearings. Different driving profiles were simulated using GT-Suite to determine the achievable reduction of fuel consumption as well as the resulting reduction of CO2 emissions. It could be shown that a local increase of the oil temperature in the main and connecting rod bearings lead to significant friction advantages in the range of part load. These simulations show a reduction of CO2 emissions of at least 1.5 g/km by increasing the oil supply temperature from 85 to 140 °C. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

Most farmers in the study area are highly aware of climate change and its consequences on the farming system; however, mitigation strategies are clearly lacking. Among the mitigation, mechanism to reduce the threat is achieved by increasing the amount of carbon sinks and reducing greenhouse gas emission through the adoption of agroforestry practices. The purpose of this study is to determine if awareness on climate change leads to the adoption of agroforestry practices, and to examine the determinants. Design/methodology/approach: A total number of 117 questionnaires were administered to the farmers in the district using stratified random sampling technique. Data were captured and analysed using STATA and XLSTAT software. Descriptive statistics and Heckprobit sample selection model were used to determine the objectives of the study.

Some of these restrictions and bans are applied without proper technical support, justifying human health affectation. Thus, it is necessary to analyse how convenient are these restrictions and how efficient they really are. Methods: To assess the effectivity of restrictions policies, the authors used regression analyses to estimate truck emissions with and without restriction of trucks. The models developed by the authors allow to estimate truck emissions based on distance (Vehicles Milles Traveled) by the trucks. Moreover, the models allow to determinate changes in the amount of pollutant emissions by changes in the Vehicles Milles Traveled due to restrictions or policies in urban areas. Results: To test the proposed model, numerical experiments were conducted in Medellin, Colombia, where there is a history of trucking bans due to emissions. The results for the Medellin Metropolitan Area show that the truck circulation restriction does not reduce the amount of emissions that affect human health. Instead, the emissions were more concentrated in the hours without restriction, having a counterintuitive effect, that could affect more human health. Conclusions: In terms of environment, a political strategy that at first hand appears to be a good decision, could not be one in the long term. For this reason, it is necessary to have technical support and prevent undesired effects to the city. In the Medellin Metropolitan Area with the truck ban policy, not significant change was found in the amount of pollutant (PM2.5). Nevertheless, with the restriction, the emissions are concentrated, and this is an undesired effect, especially for human health. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; Emissions models; Human health; Trucking ban; Urban freight",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069954831

Particularly on the Pt catalyst, its facile reaction kinetics and lack of effective methods to compensate mass transport make it difficult to isolate kinetic and diffusion contributions. This study focuses on the quantitative description of mass transfer constraints arising from both H2 and phosphate buffer ions using a Pt electrocatalyst in near-neutral pH regions, which are overlooked in the literature despite the relevance to various (photo-) electrochemical reactions for water splitting and CO2 reduction. The established HER model that uses H+ as a reactant quantitatively breaks down the observed overpotentials with diffusion contributions of both hydrogen and buffer species while the intrinsic kinetics on Pt exhibits negligible contribution. The significance of electrolyte engineering, that is, the optimization of the electrolyte identity and molality, is confirmed to determine the overall HER performance. To maximize the HER performance on Pt at ambient temperature, the phosphate-buffer electrolyte should be adjusted to a pH close to pKa of the buffer that effectively minimizes the pH gradient and to the adequate molality of the buffer (typically ∼0.5 M phosphates) that H2 diffusion is maximized, which is related with H2 solubility and solution viscosity. At pH far from pKa, concentration overpotential of buffer ion dominates the overall performance, which requires highly dense buffer (&gt;1.5 M phosphates) to minimize the pH gradient.

Today's trend is the construction of passive houses with the best insulation and reduced heating costs. By reducing the incineration of non-renewable sources for heating, we will reduce the carbon footprint, but by increasing the classical building thermal insulation, whether based on plastics or minerals. A suitable option is natural materials. This article deals with the use of technical hemp in concrete. Hemp is a historically widely used plant, but its decline has occurred due to its similarity to the THC variety, so this plant is now more known for its narcotic effects. For use in construction, industry, etc., the Cannabis Sativa L. variety, so-called Technical Hemp with negligible THC content, is used. Today, the use of technical cannabis is rediscovered. By adding technical hemp to the concrete, we improve the thermal properties of the concrete to the detriment of strength properties. The article describes different properties of the hemp concrete compared to the conventional concrete. In the building construction industry, it is known for the use in the cannabis insulation, hemp concrete, hemp oils and varnishes, Honeycomb plaster, ropes and strands. The best known are the cannabis insulation in the form of mats and hemp ropes, but there is also a widespread use of cannabis, which is discussed in this article. By measuring, the compressive strengths of the cannulated concrete were 1.13 MPa, which is comparable to that of the lightweight concrete and foam concrete.

Temperate, old-growth forests are rare and the long-term effect of setting aside forest reserves e.g. for habitat conservation on forest carbon stocks and carbon sequestration remains uncertain. In this study, we assessed the five principal forest carbon pools in a semi-natural, temperate forest in Denmark and evaluated the changes in biomass and dead wood carbon stocks over 20 years. We also benchmarked the current carbon stocks against those in managed beech-dominated forests in the same region. In the most recent inventory, carbon stocks totalled 395 Mg ha−1 of which 47% was in above-ground live biomass, 11% in below-ground biomass, 9% in dead wood, 2% in the forest floor, and 31% in the top 75 cm of the mineral soil. Compared to similar, but managed forests in the same region, carbon stocks in above- and below-ground biomass as well as in dead wood was notably larger. However, analyses of above- and below-ground biomass and dead wood carbon stocks showed remarkable stability during the past 20 years, despite major disturbances in terms of windthrows and various pathogens. Despite the overall stability of carbon stocks we observed some significant spatio-temporal changes. Notably, the observed dynamics illustrate a general retreat of Q. robur and increasing dominance of F. sylvatica under a small-scale disturbance regime. The forest floor and soil carbon stocks averaged 131 ± 4 Mg ha−1 and were very similar to those of managed beech-dominated forests, suggesting little potential for soil carbon sequestration from setting forests aside as unmanaged. Our study has implications for selection of adequate forest management strategies to efficiently mitigate climate change as it confirms the large and persistent carbon stocks in old-growth forests compared to managed forests, but offers no evidence of continued carbon sequestration in old-growth forests. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass; Climate change mitigation; Dead wood; Litter; Mineral soil; Old-growth; Suserup Forest; Unmanaged forest","Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Ecology; Floors; Soils; Wood; Climate change mitigation; Dead wood; Litter; Mineral soils; Old growth; Suserup Forest; Unmanaged forest; Forestry; biomass; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate change; dead wood; deciduous forest; ecosystem dynamics; forest inventory; forest management; habitat management; litter; nature reserve; old-growth forest; temperate forest; temporal analysis; Biomass; Carbon; Dead Wood; Ecology; Floors; Denmark; Fagus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066240079

All these fuels except soot effectively compete for the available O2 throughout volatiles conversion, which significantly affects N-species transformations. This simulation study validates a collection of detailed reaction mechanisms that accurately interprets how coal quality and inlet O2 level affect all the major reactants, intermediates, and products, including N-species, within dense burning coal suspensions. Predicted flame structures are generally within measurement uncertainties for three diverse coals and inlet O2 levels from 2 to 15%, provided that the kinetics for tar decomposition into soot, CO, H2, and gaseous hydrocarbons are implemented in a particular way. Tar decomposition kinetics should always be evaluated at the particle thermal history to ensure that they keep pace with primary devolatilization so that gaseous hydrocarbons can mediate HCN conversion into NO under locally reducing atmospheres. Moreover, gaseous hydrocarbons that would otherwise add to soot during the later stages in inert atmospheres should be burned in the free stream along with other noncondensable fuel components, again, to mediate NO production under reducing conditions. However, radical scavenging and heterogeneous NO reduction on soot appear to be superfluous. These findings reveal an important qualification on the limiting scenario for complete mixing of volatiles into an entrainment stream before they are converted: Tars must coalesce into soot in the immediate vicinity of their parent particles even while noncondensable fuels are fully dispersed across an entrainment stream; otherwise, hydrocarbons, H2, and CO will be unavailable to mediate HCN decomposition into NO. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coal combustion; Coal volatiles; Dense coal suspensions; FLASHCHAIN®; Reaction mechanism","Coal; Dust; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Reaction intermediates; Soot; Tar; Uncertainty analysis; Coal volatiles; Decomposition kinetics; Detailed reaction mechanisms; FLASHCHAIN; Gaseous hydrocarbon; Measurement uncertainty; Reaction mechanism; Reducing conditions; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061767796

This work assesses the age and quantifies the scale and structure of time averaging of land snail-rich colluvial sediments from the Madeira Archipelago (Portugal) by dating individual shells using amino acid racemization calibrated with graphite-target and carbonate-target accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon methods. Gastropod shells of Actinella nitidiuscula were collected from seven sites on the volcanic islands of Bugio and Deserta Grande (Desertas Islands), where snail shells are abundant and well preserved in Quaternary colluvial deposits. Results show that the shells ranged in age from modern to ∼48 cal ka BP (calibrated radiocarbon age), covering the last glacial and present interglacial periods. Snail shells retrieved from two of the colluvial sites exhibit multimillennial age mixing (>6 ka), which significantly exceeds the analytical error from dating methods and calibration. The observed multimillennial mixing of these assemblages should be taking into consideration in upcoming paleoenvironmental and paleoecological studies in the region. The extent of age mixing may also inform about the time span of colluvial deposition, which can be useful in future geomorphological studies. In addition, this study presents the first carbonate-target radiocarbon results for land snail shells and suggests that this novel, rapid, and more affordable dating method offers reliable age estimates for small land snail shells younger than ∼20 cal ka BP.

The siting of new wind and solar power plants requires close coordination with grid planning, and hence co-optimization of investment in generation and transmission expansion in spatially and temporally resolved models is an indispensable but complex problem. Particularly considerations of transmission expansion planning (TEP) add to the problem's complexity. Even if the power flow equations are linearized, the optimization problem is still bilinear and mixed-integer due to the dependence of line expansion on line impedance and a discrete set of line expansion options. While it is possible to linearize this mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) by applying a big-M disjunctive relaxation, the resulting MILP is still hard to solve using state-of-The-Art solvers for large-scale energy system models. In this paper we therefore develop heuristics to incorporate integer transmission expansion and responsive line impedances in energy system models, while retaining the lower computational effort of continuous linear programming (LP) by applying sequential linear programming (SLP) techniques, relaxation and discretization approaches. We benchmark their performance against the results of the exact formulation for a policy-relevant case study of the German transmission system in terms of their speed-up in computation time, deviation from optimal total system cost, and similarity of line expansion. Using heuristics we reduce computation times of joint generation and transmission optimisation by 82% with a maximal total system cost deviation of only 1.5%. The heuristics closely mirror optimal integer line investment of the exact MINLP with considerable time savings for policy-relevant low-carbon energy system optimization models. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Benchmarking; Carbon; Commerce; Coordination reactions; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Expansion; Integer programming; Linear programming; Linearization; Nonlinear programming; Power markets; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Space power generation; Continuous linear programming; Low-carbon energy systems; Mixed integer nonlinear program; Optimization problems; Power flow equations; Sequential linear programming; Transmission expansion; Transmission expansion planning; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076692659

Currently, full integration of photovoltaic elements in a building is a very costly and complex undertaking, as it usually requires expensive custom modules. In order to increase the market share of BIPV in the residential mass market, a low-cost, flexible technical process to change the appearance of solar elements is required. Transparent conductive electrodes consisting of an oxide-metal-oxide (OMO) stack of thin layers have been optimized for application in thin film solar cells. Here the OMO stack is multifunctional: It provides the transparent front contact electrode and at the same time allows tuning of the module colour. This has several advantages compared to other colouring techniques, i.e. coloured glass or additional interlayers. The OMO colouring does not require an additional process step, and with sputtering an already existing deposition method is used. By varying the thickness of the oxide layers it is possible to change the reflected spectrum of the stack and with it the module colour. In this publication, we present how the optical model of the OMO stack, that is necessary for precise tuning of the colour, is first developed for OMO/glass samples and then report the changes necessary to adapt the OMOs for use on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin film solar cells. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Building integrated photovoltaics; Coloured solar cells, front contact; Copper indium gallium selenide; Oxide-metal-oxide structure","Color; Commerce; Competition; Copper compounds; Gallium compounds; Layered semiconductors; Metals; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Thin films; Transparent electrodes; Tuning; Building-integrated photovoltaics; Deposition methods; Gallium selenides; Multifunctional metal oxide; Oxide metals; Reflected spectrum; Thickness of the oxide layers; Transparent conductive electrodes; Thin film solar cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067381697

The highest energy value demand was recorded in Chad. The average annual expenditure on health was estimated from US$520/capita in Gabon. According to scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the mean monthly cooling energy demand in residential buildings will increase to 81.6% and 167.3%, respectively, by 2100, as compared to that in 2016 in the Central African countries.

This attention is justified given the importance of land use and management to greenhouse gas mitigation, soil and forest productivity, and other ecosystem services. However, there is a gap of scale and scope between site-level studies that control for sources of variation, producing high-confidence results for limited locations, and the broad reviews that offer more general conclusions. The present analysis is intended to fill that gap. Here, we focus on six ecoregions of the eastern United States, and integrate meta-analysis of published literature with synthesis of geo-referenced soil observations to: (1) test whether common land use and management practices quantitatively impact SOC; (2) identify key sources of variation in these effects; (3) assess how sources of variation translate to decisions about land use and management at ecoregional to landscape levels. Results corroborate general trends, such as O horizon SOC losses with harvesting and fire and SOC gains during reforestation, but provide greater detail about the influence of specific practices and site-level controls on SOC stocks and change in the study region. Results also show that: (1) harvest impacts depend upon landform and soil taxonomy; (2) harvesting forests that are recovering on previously cultivated lands decreases SOC; (3) tree biomass and SOC recovery increase concurrently during reforestation; (4) specific harvest, site preparation, and fire management practices affect the magnitude and variability of changes in SOC. Perhaps more importantly, ecoregional classification and soil taxonomy provide spatial frameworks for placing quantitative estimates of SOC stocks and changes in the geographic context of the study region, providing greater detail and specificity for individuals and institutions concerned with SOC management at more localized levels. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"Ecosystems; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; Organic carbon; Reforestation; Soils; Taxonomies; Ecosystem services; Forest productivity; Geographic contexts; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Land use and managements; Quantitative estimates; Soil organic carbon; Sources of variation; Land use; biomass; decision making; ecoregion; fire management; forest management; greenhouse gas; land use planning; meta-analysis; quantitative analysis; soil carbon; taxonomy; Ecosystems; Forest Management; Greenhouse Gases; Harvesting; Land Use; Reforestation; Soil; Sources; Maryland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066994763

This paper presents a framework for how such assessments can better differentiate between the impacts of climate change and those of natural variability, an important differentiation as it relates to the vulnerability to water availability under change. The key concept involved is to characterize “hydrologic stress” relative to the range of behaviour encountered under baseline conditions, where the degree to which climate change causes the behaviour of a system to shift outside this baseline range provides a non-dimensional measure of stress. The concept is applicable to any system that is subject to climate forcings, though the approach is applied here to a range of examples illustrative of many environmental and engineering applications. These include hydrologic systems that are dependent on the frequency of flows above or below selected thresholds, those that are dominated by storage and those which are sensitive to the sequencing of selected flow components. The analyses illustrate that systems designed or adapted to accommodate high variability are less stressed by a given magnitude of climate impacts than those operating under more uniform conditions. The metrics characterize hydrologic stress in a manner that can facilitate comparison across different regions, or across different assets within a region. Adoption of the approach requires reliance on the use of climate ensembles that represent aleatory uncertainty under both baseline and impacted conditions, and this has implications for how the outputs of climate models are provided and utilized. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Climate models; Aleatory uncertainty; Base-line conditions; Climate change projections; Engineering applications; Hydrologic systems; Natural variability; Vulnerability assessments; Water availability; Climate change; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; climate forcing; climate modeling; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069488235

What unites these examples is that they all represent framework legislation that aims to facilitate climate change mitigation by creating continuous policy processes whereby mechanisms for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are developed and implemented. This article is concerned with the extent to which they are living policy processes or rather symbolic gestures. We analyse seven European CCAs with regard to GHG emission reduction targets, planning/implementation mechanisms, and feedback/evaluations prescribed by the laws. These three features correspond with three aspects of climate policy integration (CPI): interpretations of CPI as a norm; CPI as a process of governing; CPI as a policy outcome. We show that CCAs address all three aspects of CPI and constitute living policy processes, although to varying extents. However, CCAs are also policy processes in that they are part of a political system, affected by political forces external to the legislation, positively and negatively. Key policy insights CCAs can provide a normative basis for policymaking on climate change at the national level, especially through quantitative emission reduction targets. Whilst CCAs can bring some stability and predictability to policymaking on climate change (mainly because legislation is more difficult to amend or remove than policy strategies), they are still vulnerable to political developments. Most CCAs lack either short/medium-term (Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Sweden) or long-term (Austria) targets. Given EU Member States’ aim to decarbonise in the next three decades and the Paris Agreement's global goal of pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C, states need to find ways to guide this process. One approach could be the inclusion of short-term, medium-term and long-term targets in their CCAs. Since sanctioning mechanisms are lacking across all the CCAs analysed here, it is not clear what will happen if legally binding targets are not met. Just as it is difficult to imagine speed limits and speed cameras without accompanying penalties, it is hard to imagine how CCAs without sanctions can deliver decarbonization. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change mitigation; climate change policies; climate policy frameworks","climate change; emission control; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; policy approach; policy making; quantitative analysis; Austria; Denmark; Finland; Ireland; Sweden; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067679852

However, their dependence on meagre incomes from nontimber forest products (NTFPs) and payment for ecosystem services (PES) are leading to continuing poverty. It is doubtful if the program, Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has yet achieved much in its primary goal of forest conservation, and the chance of it helping to alleviate rural poverty is slim. Forest conservation per se hardly creates economic opportunities, beyond survival, for rural people. Our efforts for conserving forests and their biodiversity will remain less effective as long as there are so many enclaves of trenchant poverty within and around them in the landscapes and we continue to by-pass practical routes to poverty alleviation. Poverty can be alleviated only if local actions spur economic development in which local communities have a rightful and fair share and can earn rewards for their entrepreneurships. Wood is a renewable, recyclable, versatile and sustainable natural resource. The demands for wood products are rising in developing countries, as their economies grow. They also face endemic wood deficits. This provides opportunities to pro-actively develop commercial forestry as a path to rural development and poverty alleviation. That would also assist national climate change mitigation measures, because forests sequester carbon, wood products are largely carbon positive and timber- based options are on hand to substitute for high emission materials such as concrete, steel and aluminium used to build our living environments. To move along this path, the businesses of tree growing by small-growers and local value adding should be strengthened, catalysing the entrepreneurial spirits of local people. Central to this is the need to put in place strategies to improve the productivity of and value from small scale enterprises; yet there is a serious lack of research and application to serve this key need. Among other constraints faced by small-growers include, lack of transparent and legal rights to land ownership in several countries, layers of bureaucratic regulations and the current international forest certification systems which are cumbersome and unaffordable for small-growers. Actions are possible and needed for simplifying or removing road blocks on all these fronts, along with, importantly, the development of markets for diverse products. Growth of the forestry sector as an engine for rural development warrants far greater recognition and investment than has been the case so far. We need to re-imagine and strengthen the role of forestry including commercial wood business - green growth - as an effective path to rural development and poverty alleviation. © 2019","Climate change mitigation; Environmental incomes; Forestry; Poverty alleviation; Rural economy; Small-growers; Wood products","Biodiversity; Carbon; Concrete products; Conservation; Deforestation; Developing countries; Economics; Ecosystems; Forestry; Laws and legislation; Regional planning; Timber; Tropics; Wood products; Climate change mitigation; Environmental incomes; Poverty alleviation; Rural economy; Small-growers; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; ecological economics; economic development; ecosystem service; environmental economics; forest management; forestry; green economy; landownership; market conditions; nontimber forest product; poverty alleviation; rural development; rural economy; tropical forest; wood; Biodiversity; Carbon; Concrete; Conservation; Deforestation; Developing Countries",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067204806

This paper therefore seeks to examine the collaboration of diverse urban climate change actors. We analyze the connections between these individuals and climate protection-related organizations, projects and events. We also look at how diverse the different types of organizations are. Our empirical data consists of the organizational memberships of individual actors in a medium-sized German city, the attributes of these actors and their participation in organizations, projects or events related to climate protection. The data was collected through an online network survey.

The production of liquid biofuel has emerged as an alternative to the use of fossil fuels for purposes of energy conservation, carbon emission mitigation and agricultural development. In this article we study the co-movements between hydrous ethanol and gasoline C in the Brazilian retail market. A multi-scale cross correlation analysis was applied to the Average Retail Margin time series of hydrous ethanol for fifteen relevant retail markets in Brazil to analyze the competitiveness of hydrous ethanol towards gasoline C. The empirical results showed a remarkable different behavior between hydrous ethanol and gasoline C, for any time scale, regardless of geographical distance or regional differences. © 2019 by the authors.","DCCA cross-correlation coefficient; Ethanol; Fuel retail market","biofuel; carbon emission; comparative study; competitiveness; emissions trading; energy resource; ethanol; fossil fuel; price dynamics; retailing; time series analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071972053

A series of samples were grown with various supplies of zinc vapor, which can easily be controlled by the amount of the precursor gas methane (CH4) used to reduce the ZnO powder. In the substrate region, the zinc vapor was reoxidized by pure oxygen, which initially led to the formation of ZnO islands on the substrate, and for longer growth duration to the desired highly crystalline ZnO layers. To determine the details about this initial layer formation process, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used. We find that the ZnO microcrystals coalesce very fast and form a smooth and closed layer after a growth time of 10 min only. Electron backscatter diffraction measurements on this early stage of the layer formation show a perfect c-orientation of the ZnO microcrystals. Also high-resolution X-ray diffraction measurements support the perfect alignment of the ZnO layer and show a drastic increase in crystal quality over growth time. This increase in crystal quality is also demonstrated by low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements, in which the spectra show sharp lines for the donor-bound excitons already for the ZnO microcrystals. The PL spectra also show clearly that the tendency of forming basal plane stacking faults is quite high when the ZnO microcrystals are starting to coalesce but anneal out very fast after coalescence. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Aluminum coatings; Aluminum nitride; Atomic force microscopy; Excitons; II-VI semiconductors; Methane; Microcrystals; Sapphire; Scanning electron microscopy; Semiconductor quantum wells; Substrates; Superconducting films; Temperature; X ray diffraction analysis; Zinc oxide; Basal plane stacking faults; Chemical vapor depositions (CVD); Donor-bound exciton; Electron back scatter diffraction; High resolution X ray diffraction; Low temperature photoluminescence; Nucleation layers; Sapphire substrates; Chemical vapor deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072566528

In Zimbabwe, climate governance has largely been presented from a political angle as indicated in the current climate governance structure. Apparently, the structure does not directly involve rural communities who at the same time suffer the most from the effects of climate change. Hence, the study intends to demonstrate that the manner in which humans perceive climate change influences their responses and actions vis-à-vis climate governance. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study used 20 participants from a rural community in Zimbabwe. Their experiences were used as lances through which indigenous climate governance could be envisioned and executed. In-depth interviews were used to collect data and thematic content analysis was used to analyse data. Findings: The study found that climate change perceptions and observations of weather conditions informs the community’s decisions on how to adapt to the impacts of climate change vis-à-vis indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) climate governance. The study also proposed a paradigm shift from a Western-oriented climate governance structure that currently exists in Zimbabwe to an indigenous model through a proposed IKS governance structure. This was considered significant because of the fact that it closely accommodates the community based on their lifestyle. Originality/value: The study proposes a paradigm shift from a Western-oriented climate governance structure that currently exist in Zimbabwe to an indigenous model through a proposed IKS governance structure. This is arrived at by assessing climate change perceptions, narratives and experiences by community members. This is of particular importance because a few scholars have explored climate governance via IKS. © 2019, Shingirai Stanley Mugambiwa and Joseph Rudigi Rukema.","Climate change; Climate governance; Indigenous knowledge systems; Mutoko district","climate change; indigenous knowledge; lifestyle; paradigm shift; political discourse; questionnaire survey; rural area; state role",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070309810

Sudan confronts a problem to deal with fossil fuel resources limitation and the increasing of waste accumulation. Introducing new technologies such as waste to energy (WTE) may help to handle such concerns. The objective of this study was to design and construct a landfill cell to provide an appropriate technical solution for both waste and energy sectors, and also to measure landfill gas (LFG) and specially the CH4 content that can be produced. The results showed the feasibility of this technology to produce a source of energy from municipal solid waste, which can be an alternative to fossil fuel. The gas analyzer GFM410 was used to analyze the extracted LFG contents, CH4 content varies in the range from 48% to 56% and CO2 vary in the range from 39% to 47.2%; Using LandGEM model ver. 3.02 to predict LFG contents for 10 years and results show the total LFG, CH4 and CO2 at 2019 are 0.025 Mg/year, 0.0067 Mg/year and 0.0185Mg/year respectively which was the peak year, 0.0067 Mg/year was equivalent to 10.1 m3/year for CH4. Using LFG as fuel to run engines at WTE plant would help to reduce GHG emissions and usage of fossils fuel, landfill technology representing a proper solution for both energy demand and waste contamination problems; the key factors for this new technologies is to increase the environmental awareness among the people so they will start to treat waste as value energy source. © 2019 IEEE.","Energy recovery; Energy resources; Landfill; MSW; Waste-to-Energy","Carbon dioxide; Energy management; Environmental technology; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Magnesium compounds; Municipal solid waste; Alternative energy source; Alternative to fossil fuels; Contamination problem; Environmental awareness; Fossil fuel resources; Proper solutions; Resources depletion; Technical solutions; Biogas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084283337

Background and Objectives: Forests and forestry have been confirmed to be sensitive to climate. On the other hand, human efforts to mitigate climate change influence forests and forest management. To facilitate the evaluation of future sustainability of forest management, decision support systems are applied. Our aims are to: (1) Adopt and validate decision support tool to incorporate climate change and its mitigation impacts on forest growth, global timber demands and prices for simulating future trends of forest ecosystem services in Lithuania, (2) determine the magnitude and spatial patterns of climate change effects on Lithuanian forests and forest management in the future, supposing that current forestry practices are continued. Materials and Methods: Upgraded version of Lithuanian forestry simulator Kupolis was used to model the development of all forests in the country until 2120 under management conditions of three climate change scenarios. Selected stand-level forest and forest management characteristics were aggregated to the level of regional branches of the State Forest Enterprise and analyzed for the spatial and temporal patterns of climate change effects. Results: Increased forest growth under a warmer future climate resulted in larger tree dimensions, volumes of growing stock, naturally dying trees, harvested assortments, and also higher profits from forestry activities. Negative impacts were detected for the share of broadleaved tree species in the standing volume and the tree species diversity. Climate change effects resulted in spatially clustered patterns-increasing stand productivity, and amounts of harvested timber were concentrated in the regions with dominating coniferous species, while the same areas were exposed to negative dynamics of biodiversity-related forest attributes. Current forest characteristics explained 70% or more of the variance of climate change effects on key forest and forest management attributes. Conclusions: Using forest decision support systems, climate change scenarios and considering the balance of delivered ecosystem services is suggested as a methodological framework for validating forest management alternatives aiming for more adaptiveness in Lithuanian forestry. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Ecosystem services; Forestry; Mitigation efforts; Simulation; Spatial statistics","Artificial intelligence; Biodiversity; Climate models; Decision making; Decision support systems; Ecosystems; Forestry; Sustainable development; Timber; Broadleaved tree species; Ecosystem services; Management characteristics; Methodological frameworks; Mitigation efforts; Simulation; Spatial and temporal patterns; Spatial statistics; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; computer simulation; decision support system; ecosystem service; environmental policy; forest management; model validation; spatial analysis; sustainability; Artificial Intelligence; Biodiversity; Decision Making; Ecosystems; Forestry; Simulation; Lithuania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072526944

However, the management intensification for increased productivity and the removal of additional biomass from these plantations could reduce carbon (C)inputs belowground and therefore reduce overall ecosystem C storage. Increased fertilization could also affect C stocks, and their relative distribution between soil organic matter (SOM)fractions. We analyzed soil C stocks as a function of soil type and different pine plantation management systems across the Western Gulf region of the United States. Additionally, we analyzed SOM fractions with inherently different stabilization mechanisms and potential C persistence. We found no significant differences in bulk soil C stocks across management intensities or soil types. The early thinning treatment had no effect on the C distribution across each soil organic matter fraction. However, proportionally more C was found in mineral-associated organic matter and less in particulate organic matter in the more intensive management regime treatment, possibly due to higher below ground nutrient inputs and enhanced microbial activity. Our results suggest that management intensification to support biofuel production from loblolly pine plantations will not affect soil C stocks, but may increase their persistence. This study demonstrates that, from a soil C perspective, early thinning of intensively managed loblolly pine plantations has potential as a sustainable biofuel feedstock. © 2019","Loblolly pine plantations; Soil carbon; Soil organic matter fractions","Biofuels; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Feedstocks; Organic carbon; Soils; Increased productivity; Intensive management; Loblolly pine plantations; Particulate organic matters; Soil carbon; Soil organic matter pools; Soil organic matters; Stabilization mechanisms; Forestry; agricultural intensification; biofuel; biomass; coniferous tree; particulate organic matter; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil stabilization; soil type; Forestry; Management; Organic Matter; Pinus Taeda; Plantations; Soil; Thinning; United States; Pinus taeda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066281268

The use of global indicators has not been a sustainable solution, thus the need for local indicators. Besides, current sustainability assessment tools lack the integration of climate, making assessments in a climate change context impossible. In this paper, we present management and sustainability assessment in a climate change context using sustainability indicators. We modeled a change in the climate using normal, moderate, and extreme climate conditions defined by Standardized Precipitation Indices (SPI) values. Out of 36 years analyzed, 24 years fall in the near-normal climate regime, and the remaining 12 years in moderate and extreme conditions, making near-normal climate regime the basis for managing the Taabo Dam. The impact of climate, techno-economic, and socio-environmental indicators on sustainability were investigated, and the results were analyzed according to scenarios. Climate adaptation shows higher sustainability indices than techno-economic and socio-environmental scenarios. Probability matrices show high and low values, respectively, for environmental and flooding indicators. Risk matrices, on the other hand, show that even with small probability values, risks still exist, and such small probabilities should not be taken as an absence of risk. The study reveals that sustainability can be improved by integrating climate into existing assessment methods. © 2019 by the authors.","Aggregated Preference Indices System (APIS); Climate change; Indicators; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI); Sustainability; Sustainability index","adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; climate conditions; environmental indicator; flooding; index method; management practice; multicriteria analysis; sustainability; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072611225

We used Landsat 8 satellite surface reflectance data to detect the flood inundation area and extract water color for delineating different water sources. We also took direct samples of dissolved methane concentrations in the river water. Relatively high concentrations of dissolved methane (0.7–1.1 μmol l−1, or μM) were observed in four tributary areas in 2017 during the flood's recession, while the values remained low in the main channel (0.2–0.3 μM). In contrast, the concentrations of dissolved methane were low in both the main channel and tributaries during the non-flood period of 2016 (0.1–0.2 μM). We then used 2017 satellite reflectance data with an empirical model to estimate the spatial differences of dissolved methane concentration for water sources contributing to the methane-poor main channel and methane-rich tributaries and applied the results to the calculation of riverine methane in the study region (approx. 200 × 300 km). This approach to estimating dissolved methane concentrations using satellite reflectance can provide a new tool for environmental monitoring of flood events in remote areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR","Arctic; Dissolved methane concentration; Flooding; Landsat 8","concentration (composition); dissolved load; empirical analysis; environmental monitoring; Landsat; methane; river channel; spectral reflectance; Indigirka River; Russian Federation; Sakha; Siberia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061181543

However, the use of single-method ensembles and variations arising from different methodologies has resulted in unquantified uncertainty amongst existing global wave climate projections. Here, assessing the first coherent, community-driven, multi-method ensemble of global wave climate projections, we demonstrate widespread ocean regions with robust changes in annual mean significant wave height and mean wave period of 5–15% and shifts in mean wave direction of 5–15°, under a high-emission scenario. Approximately 50% of the world’s coastline is at risk from wave climate change, with ~40% revealing robust changes in at least two variables. Furthermore, we find that uncertainty in current projections is dominated by climate model-driven uncertainty, and that single-method modelling studies are unable to capture up to ~50% of the total associated uncertainty. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; coastal zone management; environmental planning; global climate; multivariate analysis; significant wave height; uncertainty analysis; wave climate; wave direction; wind wave",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071132024

The solution is based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) executed on a resource constrained low cost embedded micro controller integrated into a sensing unit very close to the microphone. The prototype operates without the need of being connected to a remote server through an always-on connectivity. The adoption of an on-the-edge artificial intelligence architecture brings a set of advantages: safety, reliability, promptness and low power consumption. The embedded intelligence is trained from a purpose-built dataset enclosing environmental car engine sound data. A pre trained ANN classifies sound events and counts cars approaching and leaving the microphone by sensing the Doppler Effects in the sound emitted by the moving vehicles. The results showed in this paper refer to the application running on the Sensortile Development Kit board from STMicroelectronics, featuring 128KB of RAM and 1MB of Flash memory. The development of the proposed solution was somehow inspired by the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Agenda defines a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. It does so by defining 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to enable the transformation into a more peaceful and free society. Among them, the ones which interested the authors to develop the proposed solution were the following; Goal 3: 'Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages' Goal 11: 'Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable' Goal 13: 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts'. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Neural Networks; Embedded Systems; Intelligent Monitoring of Vehicles; Sound Event Classification; STM32; Traffic Optimization","Automobile engines; Climate change; Embedded systems; Flash memory; Microphones; Neural networks; Planning; Random access storage; Traffic control; Embedded intelligence; Environmental intelligence; Intelligent monitoring; Low-power consumption; Sound event classification; STM32; Traffic optimization; Urban traffic management; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075631825

FEG-SEM showed well-dispersed CNT for sample subjected to pre-dispersion (PHBV/CNT-PD), and DSC showed a reduction in the degree of crystallinity from 62% to neat PHBV to 55% for PHBV/CNT-PD. Impact resistance was positively affected by the pre-dispersion, and nanohardness showed more homogeneous values for PHBV/CNT-PD sample compared to PHBV/CNT (without pre-dispersion).

The presence of oxide layers irregularly deposited on the cast iron disc surfaces usually leads to a forced, braking-induced vibration that can reach the driver's position as a pronounced annoyance. Hence, the friction material composition directly impacts on the judder performance during the early corrosion-removal stage. This study incorporates both dynamometer and vehicle tests into the definition of a predictive methodology that allows corrosion-induced vibrations to be investigated at both system and vehicle levels. The oxide film is artificially generated by means of a salt spray chamber under steady-state climate conditions in order to guarantee a repetitive and robust procedure. The vibration response of the system is objectively evaluated in the form of caliper accelerations and pressure (BPV) / torque (BTV) oscillations throughout a reduced rust-removal test sequence composed of 30 snubs; basic spectral and order analyses are conducted with the gathered data. Furthermore, vehicle-based results are correlated with the subjective ratings that an expert driver gives to the different vibrations perceived at chassis level. The in-service roughness of the oxide layer, on the other hand, is indirectly monitored by using a couple of non-contacting capacitive sensors that measure the variation in disc thickness (DTV). Ultimately, this paper is intended to characterize the inherent corrosion-cleaning capability of different friction materials -paying special attention to the presence of copper-, as well as revealing their impact on the vehicle judder subsequently induced during the actual removal of the oxide layers. © 2019 SAE International.

Some of these hope to target net-zero carbon for new and existing buildings. As in most countries, the stock of existing buildings represents the bigger challenge for this target. In particular, existing affordable housing is the most challenging segment of the building stock. The limited access to expertise and financial resources makes it more difficult for owners of these buildings to retrofit them. Therefore, there need to be appropriate guidelines on how to achieve net-zero carbon in such building typology. This paper identifies both the technical and the financial challenges when trying to develop such guidelines within the context of the UAE. It also discusses the possible solutions that can be used to overcome some of these challenges. The technical challenges include the variation in construction systems, and the quality of construction for these buildings. It also includes energy modelling challenges such as selecting relevant weather data, and defining the patterns of using electricity for the different functions. The financial challenges include the subsidized price for electricity, the cost estimation for various energy conservation methods, and the payback for installing local renewable energy sources. Finally, the paper suggests a path for research activities to address these challenges and to develop the guidelines. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Through a combined analysis of remotely sensed and meteorological data, the study revealed the extent of urban microclimate change trends within a few decades. Thus, upward changes in microclimate–temperature of nearly 2°C was witnessed in 2018 (27.7°C) against 25.9°C of 1980s. Whereas, the city expanded from 39.2 km2 in 1986 to 256 km2 in 2018. These changes witnessed in urban form and climate are attributed to rapid urban expansion and poor planning system that fails to preserve and protect the city’s green and blue infrastructure. The picture of the situation in Kano gives insights into the enormous challenges before cities in developing world to cope with local and global climate change risks. Indeed, this situation calls for an integrated approach to addressing climate change from within and without cities themselves. It is imperative on policymakers to increase expenditure on urban planning, financing adaptation strategies through urban planning, and strengthening of institutions of urban planning. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","green areas; infrastructure; microclimate; Urban growth; urban heat island","climate change; greenspace; heat island; infrastructure; microclimate; urban growth; urban planning; urbanization; Kano [Kano (STT)]; Kano [Nigeria]; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064672333

Generally, the fact that climate change is not a new phenomenon has attracted scholars to conduct numerous relevant studies. Unfortunately, most past researches were not from the perspectives of social science of the Asian's community. Hence, the present study reviewed a considerable amount of past studies on the act of adjusting with environmental change among the Asian fishermen which is known as one of the communities that are highly dependent on nature stability. Meanwhile, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was adopted for the review of the current research which utilised two main journal databases, namely Scopus and Web of Science. Accordingly, the searching efforts resulted in a total of 18 articles that can be analysed systematically. Most importantly, the review managed to formulate five main themes, namely livelihood diversification, social, physical infrastructure, awareness-knowledge-experience, and conservation and enforcement based on the thematic analyses. Overall, further analysis of the five themes resulted in the establishment of a total of 21 sub-themes. Finally, a number of recommendations were presented at the end of this research for the reference of future scholars. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Asian fishermen; Climate change adaptation; Climate change impacts; Systematic review","Mirrors; Adaptation strategies; Asian fishermen; Climate change adaptation; Climate change impact; Environmental change; Systematic Review; Thematic analysis; Web of Science; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067063592

For setting mitigation policies source-contribution is needed, which is calculated mostly through computationally intensive chemical transport models or manpower intensive source apportionment studies. Data based approach that use remote sensing datasets can help reduce this challenge, specially in developing countries which lack spatially and temporally dense air quality monitoring networks. Our objective was identifying relative contribution of urban emission sources to monthly PM2.5 ambient concentrations and assessing whether urban expansion can explain rise of PM2.5 ambient concentration from 2001 to 2015 in 15 Indian cities. We adapted the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) emission framework in a land use regression (LUR) model to estimate concentrations by statistically modeling the impact of urban growth on aerosol concentrations with the help of remote sensing datasets. Contribution to concentration from six key sources (residential, industrial, commercial, crop fires, brick kiln and vehicles) was estimated by inverse distance weighting of their emissions in the land-use regression model. A hierarchical Bayesian approach was used to account for the random effects due to the heterogeneous emitting sources in the 15 cities. Long-term ambient PM2.5 concentration from 2001 to 2015, was represented by a indicator R (varying from 0 to 100), decomposed from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived AOD (aerosol optical depth) and angstrom exponent datasets. The model was trained on annual-level spatial land-use distribution and technological advancement data and the monthly-level emission activity of 2001 and 2011 over each location to predict monthly R. The results suggest that above the central portion of a city, concentration due to primary PM2.5 emission is contributed mostly by residential areas (35.0 ± 11.9%), brick kilns (11.7 ± 5.2%) and industries (4.2 ± 2.8%). The model performed moderately for most cities (median correlation for out of time validation was 0.52), especially when assumed changes in seasonal emissions for each source reflected actual seasonal changes in emissions. The results suggest the need for policies focusing on emissions from residential regions and brick kilns. The relative order of the contributions estimated by this study is consistent with other recent studies and a contribution of up to 42.8 ± 14.1% is attributed to the formation of secondary aerosol, long-range transport and unaccounted sources in surrounding regions. The strength of this approach is to be able to estimate the contribution of urban growth to primary aerosols statistically with a relatively low computation cost compared to the more accurate but computationally expensive chemical transport based models. This remote sensing based approach is especially useful in locations without emission inventory. © 2019 by the authors.","Biomass burning; Brick kiln; Emission inventory; GDP; LULC; LUR; MODIS AOD; PM2.5; Remote sensing; Urban pollution","Aerosols; Air quality; Bayesian networks; Brick; Brickmaking; Climate change; Climate models; Commercial vehicles; Developing countries; Housing; Industrial emissions; Kilns; Land use; Radiometers; Random processes; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Urban transportation; Biomass-burning; Brick kilns; Emission inventories; LULC; MODIS AOD; PM2.5; Urban pollutions; Urban growth; aerosol; air quality; Bayesian analysis; biomass burning; emission inventory; land cover; land use change; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite data; urban growth; urban pollution; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072260590

However the problem has been far less debated in nuclear physics, due to the high laser intensities required to excite nuclear states or to remove nuclear particles (nucleons, clusters, etc). The advent of new powerful laser facilities around the globe provides a good opportunity to assess the main features of particle emission from nuclei exposed to ultra-intense coherent electromagnetic radiation. In the first part of this paper we review some of the most conspicuous laser field quantities employed in the diagnosis of atomic ionization processes and estimate them on a wide range of values of intensity and photon frequency. In this way we probe the threshold from which relativistic effects start to be important, but also establish when multiphoton effects are important, or when perturbation theory is no longer legitimate. We then focus on the case of proton emission from the ground state of a spherical nucleus (171Au) and the deformed nuclei 141Ho and 145Tm. By solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation we provide estimates of the proton decay-rate for long or short laser pulses as a function of intensity and photon frequency. As time-independent potential we use the Woods-Saxon form of the nuclear potential with parameters adapted for the proton-decay of 109I and the Coulomb potential produced by the uniformly distributed charge of the daughter nucleus inside the nuclear surface. We solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in cylindrical coordinates (two dimensions) using the Crank-Nicolson method. This method allows us to follow the tunneling dynamics in ultra-intense laser fields within a large spatial region compared to the nuclear volume. Application of a continuous laser field of Ti:sapphire type of very high intensity or of x-ray type with corresponding lower intensity induces only more or less pronounced oscillations around the field-free decay rate values. On the other hand, short laser pulses of rectangular shape with an odd number of half-cycles yield an enhancement of up to three orders of magnitude of the decay rate. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","laser nucleus interaction; nuclear photoeffect; proton decay; Ti:sapphire laser; ultra-intense laser; x-ray laser",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081353223

Climate change and rapid land use change are degrading peatlands, liberating their stored carbon (C) into the atmosphere. To conserve peatlands and help in realising the Paris Agreement, we need to understand their extent, status, and C stocks. However, current peatland knowledge is vague—estimates of global peatland extent ranges from 1 to 4.6 million km2, and C stock estimates vary between 113 and 612 Pg (or billion tonne C). This uncertainty mostly stems from the coarse spatial scale of global soil maps. In addition, most global peatland estimates are based on rough country inventories and reports that use outdated data. This review shows that digital mapping using field observations combined with remotely-sensed images and statistical models is an avenue to more accurately map peatlands and decrease this knowledge gap. We describe peat mapping experiences from 12 countries or regions and review 90 recent studies on peatland mapping. We found that interest in mapping peat information derived from satellite imageries and other digital mapping technologies is growing. Many studies have delineated peat extent using land cover from remote sensing, ecology, and environmental field studies, but rarely perform validation, and calculating the uncertainty of prediction is rare. This paper then reviews various proximal and remote sensing techniques that can be used to map peatlands. These include geophysical measurements (electromagnetic induction, resistivity measurement, and gamma radiometrics), radar sensing (SRTM, SAR), and optical images (Visible and Infrared). Peatland is better mapped when using more than one covariate, such as optical and radar products using nonlinear machine learning algorithms. The proliferation of satellite data available in an open-access format, availability of machine learning algorithms in an open-source computing environment, and high-performance computing facilities could enhance the way peatlands are mapped. Digital soil mapping allows us to map peat in a cost-effective, objective, and accurate manner. Securing peatlands for the future, and abating their contribution to atmospheric C levels, means digitally mapping them now. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"algorithm; digital mapping; image analysis; land cover; numerical model; peatland; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067246460

This study makes the first evaluation of natural gas-diesel RCCI combustion for mid-speed marine engines. A state-of-the-art dual-fuel engine with 350 mm bore diameter is the basis for numerical simulations. GT-Power is used to create a one-dimensional air-path model. RCCI is simulated using TNO's multi-zone combustion model incorporating detailed chemical kinetics. The simulations aim to optimize engine efficiency, with peak in-cylinder pressure and emissions as constraints. The study shows best-point Indicated Efficiency of 47.8% is achievable (@75% load) using RCCI mode on stock engine hardware, while meeting IMO Tier III's NOx limit. This performance is similar to the best contemporary marine gas engines, but RCCI also provides additional methane and CO emission reductions. Thus, RCCI combustion can meet Europe's new rigorous Stage V limits, offering significant improvements in a marine engine's GHG footprint. Crucially, the study indicates an engine using hardware optimized for RCCI could deliver outstanding indicated efficiencies of 52%, with emissions of below 1 g/kWh for all legislative species. This combination of high efficiency and ultra-low emissions would make RCCI combustion an attractive proposition for future marine propulsion and gen-set applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy optimization; Marine; Mid-speed engine; Natural gas; RCCI; Simulation","Dual fuel engines; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Ignition; Marine applications; Marine engines; Natural gas; Ship propulsion; Energy optimization; Marine; RCCI; Simulation; Speed engines; Diesel engines; cleanup; energy efficiency; engine; kinetics; marine technology; natural gas; one-dimensional modeling; optimization; ship technology; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067852355

This ES can be valued based on the avoided social cost of carbon (SC-CO2) from the long-term damage resulting from emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). The objective of this study was to assess the value of SOC stocks, based on the avoided SC-CO2 ($42 per metric ton of CO2 in 2007 U.S. dollars), in the contiguous United States (U.S.) by soil order, soil depth (0-20, 20-100, 100-200 cm), land resource region (LRR), state, and region using information from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database. The total calculated monetary value for SOC storage in the contiguous U.S. was between $4.64T (i.e., $4.64 trillion U.S. dollars, where T = trillion = 1012) and $23.1T, with a midpoint value of $12.7T. Soil orders with the highest midpoint SOC storage values were 1): Mollisols ($4.21T), 2) Histosols ($2.31T), and 3) Alfisols ($1.48T). The midpoint values of SOC normalized by area within soil order boundaries were ranked: 1) Histosols ($21.58 m-2), 2) Vertisols ($2.26 m-2), and 3) Mollisols ($2.08 m-2). The soil depth interval with the highest midpoint values of SOC storage and content was 20-100 cm ($6.18T and $0.84 m-2, respectively), while the depth interval 100-200 cm had the lowest midpoint values of SOC storage ($2.88T) and content ($0.39 m-2). The depth trends exemplify the prominence of SOC in the upper portions of soil. The LRRs with the highest midpoint SOC storage values were: 1) M - Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region ($1.8T), 2) T - Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region ($1.26T), and 3) K - Northern Lake States Forest and Forage Region ($1.16T).

States with the highest midpoint values of SOC storage were: 1) Texas ($1.08T), 2) Minnesota ($834B) (i.e., $834 billion U.S. dollars, where B = billion = 109), and 3) Florida ($742B). Midpoint values of SOC normalized by area within state boundaries were ranked: 1) Florida ($5.44 m-2), 2) Delaware ($4.10 m-2), and 3) Minnesota ($3.99 m-2). Regions with the highest midpoint values of SOC storage were: 1) Midwest ($3.17T), 2) Southeast ($2.44T), and 3) Northern Plains ($2.35T).

Therefore, it is important to investigate the influence of these materials to the hydration in blended cements. This study is dedicated to the contribution of a calcareous fly ash to the hydration of a blended cement. To assess this contribution five calcareous fly ashes were chosen. The hydration of samples of Portland cement and Portland cement with 10% mass of cement (mc), 20% mc and 30% mc of calcareous fly ash was investigated by means of isothermal heat flow calorimetry. Calorimetric investigations were carried out with a TAM Air heat-flow calorimeter. Tests were conducted in 20°C. Water-binder ratio of cement pastes for hydration heat examinations was equal 0, 5. Research had shown that the addition of calcareous fly ash showed a retardation of the hydration reactions and increasing the initial heat period. The induction period of samples of Portland cement with 10%, 20% and 30% mc of calcareous fly ash is retarded compared to the samples of Portland cement.

Specifically, undesirable output is considered as both carbon and air pollutant emissions, i.e., CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions. Also, based on the proposed approach, we identify the different paths of the technical change as a crucial driver of the AETFP growth. Furthermore, using the spatial econometric model with a symmetric geographical distance weight matrix and an asymmetric economic geography weight matrix, we investigate the effect of different types of environmental regulation on the AETFP growth to verify the Porter hypothesis in China. The results show that the main drivers of China’s atmospheric environment inefficiency are air pollutant emissions (SO2 and NOx), carbon emissions, and fossil energy use. Spatially, the environment inefficiency presents a decreasing trend from northern China to southern China. The improved performance of SO2 emissions made more contributions to the AETFP growth during China’s 11th “Five-Year Plan” period (2006–2010), while NOx emissions has a marginal positive effect on the AETFP growth is marginal. Despite the differences in the technical change across regions, the technical progress offsets the negative impact of declining technical efficiency on the AETFP growth. Overall, energy-saving and emission-reduction policies and technologies in TRTAs exert a decisive influence on the AETFP growth. In particular, the spatial econometric results indicate that the market-motivated environmental regulation has a positive effect on the AETFP growth and thus conforms to the Porter hypothesis in China but does not cause the “race-to-the-bottom” effect among local governments, while the command-and-control oriented regulation leads to a “race-to-the-bottom” effect and undermines the AETFP growth. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Atmospheric pollutant emissions; China; Decomposition; Environmental performance; Environmental regulation; Spatial lag X model","Agglomeration; Carbon; Decomposition; Emission control; Energy conservation; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Nitrogen oxides; Productivity; Telecommunication industry; Urban growth; Atmospheric environment; Atmospheric pollutant emissions; China; Energy saving and emission reductions; Environmental performance; Spatial econometric models; Total factor productivity; X model; Air pollution; agglomeration; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; economic geography; emission control; environmental protection; factor productivity; nitrate; performance assessment; regulatory framework; spatial analysis; sulfur emission; technical change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060200142

In order to identify the pollution types at a regional level, this paper applies the Luenberger productivity indicator to decompose air pollutant emissions performance. Furthermore, we simultaneously consider pollution rates and the productivity change. Thus, we propose a new modeling framework allowing for the variable-specific decomposition of the environmental performance along time and quantity dimensions to identify the underlying patterns. The panel data for 30 provinces and autonomous regions are then applied to identify regional atmospheric pollution type. The results show that SO2 emission from industrial soot and NOx emissions from vehicle exhaust constitute an important source of regional atmospheric environmental inefficiency, though the former seems to be more decisive. The southeast coastal provinces showed generally lower levels of inefficiency, compared to the northwest inland area. During the period of the 11th Five-Year Plan of China, industrial SO2 emission performance contributed to the increase in the atmospheric environmental productivity, while traffic NOx emissions acted as a negative factor in this regard. Therefore, the government should seek to increase the intensity of environmental regulation in transportation sector. At the country level, technical progress associated with both types of pollutions was positive and thus exceed the negative efficiency change for the same variables. In particular, in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the productivity changes in industrial SO2 emissions and traffic NOx emissions indicate a “stably advancing” type. The results further indicate that there are 18 provinces of China which have experienced mixed-type pollution. Jilin and Hainan were classified as provinces experiencing vehicle exhaust gas pollution, whereas Guizhou was defined as that subject to industrial soot pollution. The government should formulate and implement diversified support and regulation policies to govern SO2 and NOx pollution at the regional level. © 2019","Atmospheric pollution; Industrial soot SO2; Slack-based decomposition; Total factor productivity; Vehicle exhaust NOx","Dust; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Productivity; Soot; Telecommunication industry; Vehicle performance; Air pollutant emission; Atmospheric pollution; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Environmental performance; Industrial soot SO2; Regional air pollution; Total factor productivity; Vehicle exhausts; Air pollution; air quality; atmospheric pollution; energy use; environmental economics; nitrogen dioxide; performance assessment; soot; total factor productivity; China; Guizhou; Hainan; Jilin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071015892

The results show that sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions from primary energy consumption along with primary energy consumption are important variables contributing to atmospheric environmental inefficiency in Chinese provinces. Furthermore, static efficiency scores associated with energy consumption and atmospheric emission (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions) are lower for Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Shanxi in North China, whereas Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong and Fujian show higher values of this kind of efficiency. Atmospheric emissions contribute to the growth in the atmospheric environmental productivity to a higher extent if compared to energy consumption.

These tend to vary in their conclusions on the scale and direction of the likely macroeconomic impacts of a low-carbon transition. This paper traces the characteristic discrepancies in models’ outcomes to their origins in different macro-economic theories, most importantly their treatment of technological innovation and finance. We comprehensively analyse the relevant branches of macro-innovation theory and group them into two classes: ‘Equilibrium’ and ‘Non-equilibrium’. While both approaches are rigorous and self-consistent, they frequently yield opposite conclusions for the economic impacts of low-carbon policies. We show that model outcomes are mainly determined by their representations of monetary and finance dimensions, and their interactions with investment, innovation and technological change. Improving these in all modelling approaches is crucial for strengthening the evidence base for policy making and gaining a more consistent picture of the macroeconomic impacts of achieving emissions reductions objectives. The paper contributes towards the ongoing effort of enhancing the transparency and understanding of sophisticated model mechanisms applied to energy and climate policy analysis. It helps tackle the overall ‘black box’ critique, much-cited in policy circles and elsewhere. Key policy insights Quantitative models commissioned by policy-makers to assess the macroeconomic impacts of climate policy generate contradictory outcomes and interpretations. The source of the differences in model outcomes originates primarily from assumptions on the workings of the financial sector and the nature of money, and of how these interact with processes of low-carbon energy innovation and technological change. Representations of innovation and technological change are incomplete in energy-economy-environment models, leading to limitations in the assessment of the impacts of climate-related policies. All modelling studies should state clearly their underpinning theoretical school and their treatment of finance and innovation. A strong recommendation is given for modellers of energy-economy systems to improve their representations of money and finance. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In this paper, the multi-criteria evaluation method is used to identify suitable sites to host Photovoltaic projects in southern Morocco. For this purpose, geographical information systems and analytic hierarchy process methods were combined to represent a high-resolution map that compares the potential of the studied region to host large-scale Photovoltaic projects.

Objectives: To examine potential synergistic associations of coexposure to house dust endotoxin and ambient air pollutants with asthma outcomes. Methods: We analyzed data of 6,488 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2006. Dust from bedding and bedroom floor was analyzed for endotoxin content. The Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) and Downscaler Model data were used to determine annual average particulate matter &lt;2.5 mm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposures at participants’ residential locations. The associations of the coexposures with asthma outcomes were assessed and tested for synergistic interaction. Measurements and Main Results: In adjusted analysis, PM2.5 (CMAQ) (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07–1.18), O3 (Downscaler Model) (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02–1.13), and log10 NO2 (CMAQ) (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.33–7.45) were positively associated with emergency room visits for asthma in the past 12 months. Coexposure to elevated concentrations of house dust endotoxin and PM2.5 (CMAQ) was synergistically associated with the outcome, increasing the odds by fivefold (OR, 5.01; 95% CI, 2.54–9.87). A synergistic association was also found for coexposure to higher concentrations of endotoxin and NO2 in children (OR, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.65–7.18). Conclusions: Coexposure to elevated concentrations of residential endotoxin and ambient PM2.5 in all participants and NO2 in children is synergistically associated with increased emergency room visits for asthma. Therefore, decreasing exposure to both endotoxin and air pollution may help reduce asthma morbidity.

In 2016, its global average population (students, faculty and staff) was around 2750 people. Campus policies include sustainability as one of its main aims. To evaluate and eventually reduce the environmental impact of the campus, its greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory was assessed and the carbon footprint was calculated, using the GHG protocol (GHGP): Scope 1: direct GHG emissions; Scope 2: indirect GHG emissions; and Scope 3: other indirect GHG emissions, on a calendar year basis. Scope 1 includes mobile and stationary sources and leakage of refrigerants; Scope 2 includes electrical energy usage; Scope 3 includes consumption of paper, food, water, gases, cleaning products, solvents, wastewater treatment, municipal and hazardous wastes and academic travel. In 2016, the campus produced around 3000 tons of CO2 equivalent, with Scope 1, 2 and 3 accounting for 4%, 24% and 72%, respectively. Emissions analysis by activity indicated 51% for commuting; 24% for electricity usage; 14% for academic travel; 11% for other activities. The inventory will aid the establishment of policies for reduction and mitigation of GHG, resulting in environmental and potential economic benefits. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Carbon accounting; carbon footprint; climate change; greenhouse gas inventory; university","Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Carbon accounting; Economic benefits; Electrical energy; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Greenhouse gas inventory; Public universities; Stationary sources; university; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071709778

We performed an independent reanalysis of publicly available AOSR snow pack data to: replicate previous results; to provide new insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of metal and PAC deposition; and, to determine whether certain metals or PACs were associated with specific oil sands mining or upgrading activities. Using PAC ratios, we use a K-means clustering approach to classify snowpack data into two combustion-dominated classes, and three classes associated with oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading. Snow samples dominated by “oil sands mine” emissions are consistent with a petrogenic source and exhibited low UNS ratios and high DBT ratios. Snow samples dominated by “petroleum coke” emissions had the highest BaP ratios, high DBT ratios, and were collected nearest the upgrader complexes. Metals data indicate snow samples dominated by oil sands mine emissions are consistent with an Athabasca Sands type composition. Those dominated by emissions from petroleum coke show enrichment of biophile metals V, Ni, and M. We conclude that previous studies have over-estimated environmental loadings of PACs, their spatial extent, and direction of their trend over time. These differences are attributed to the use of arithmetic rather than geometric spatial averaging, use of an arbitrary location (AR6)to determine the extent of metals and PAC deposition, and because previous studies neglected to account for metals and PACs being deposited from non-oil sands sources. Oil sands operators continue to reduce their emissions intensity, however there is an emerging consensus that mitigating fugitive emissions from petroleum coke stockpiles may represent the greatest opportunity to reduce environmental loadings of PACs in the AOSR. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Athabasca oil sands; Atmospheric deposition; Metals; Polycyclic aromatic compounds; Snow","Antennas; Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Barium compounds; Bituminous materials; Deposition; Gasoline; K-means clustering; Metals; Meteorological problems; Oil sands; Petroleum coke; Snow; Athabasca oil sands; Atmospheric depositions; Emissions intensity; Environmental loadings; Fugitive emissions; Petrogenic sources; Polycyclic aromatic compounds; Spatial and temporal patterns; Sand; aluminum; benzo[a]pyrene; metal; nickel; petroleum; polycyclic aromatic compound; snow; vanadium; atmospheric deposition; bitumen; chemical pollutant; metal; oil sand; organic compound; snowpack; Article; atmospheric deposition; Canada; climate change; combustion; environmental parameters; geometry; land use; mining; prediction; priority journal; sample; sandy soil; soil analysis; Alberta; Alberta; Athabasca Oil Sands; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066070973

To offset their resource demands, cities derive goods and resources from regions well outside urban boundaries inducing stress and impacts on distal ecosystems. As cities grow, these stressors are likely to increase, depending on choices about how resource demands will be addressed through new infrastructures; hence, city governance is extremely important to future global sustainability. However, to support effective decision-making and infrastructure transitions, developing tangible city-scale alternative future scenarios is needed. We present a methodology for developing plausible spatially explicit alternative futures for city infrastructures and discuss the tradeoffs in land, energy, carbon, and water resources among alternative future pathways. We first estimate future city populations and urban boundaries and characterize future land cover scenarios. Future population along with residential housing and commercial characteristics are used to estimate current and future electricity and water demand. We characterize the energysheds of cities, which then become the spatial template for designing future electricity production scenarios. Future electricity mixes and spatial distributions of powerplants provide wide-ranging tradeoffs in carbon reduction, water use reduction, and land usage. Additionally, we explore future alternatives for meeting water supply demands. Herein, we emphasize the importance of translating scenarios into physical on-the-ground relevance in order to ensure transparent communication among city- and utility-governance. Unless spatially explicit future infrastructure scenarios are provided, we believe city-level goals will become difficult to implement, or even worse, result in unintended consequences on regional natural resources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Consumption; Demand; Electricity production; Energy-water nexus; Power plant siting; Water use","Carbon; Commerce; Decision making; Housing; Sustainable development; Water resources; Water supply; Carbon emissions; Consumption; Demand; Electricity production; Energy-water nexus; Water use; Electric power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067801068

MRI and positron emission tomography have shown that neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are associated with changes in brain networks. However, the underlying neurophysiological pathways driving pathological processes are poorly defined. The gap between what imaging can discern and underlying pathophysiology can now be addressed by advanced techniques that explore the cortical neural synchronisation, excitability and functional connectivity that underpin cognitive, motor, sensory and other functions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation can show changes in focal excitability in cortical and transcortical motor circuits, while electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography can now record cortical neural synchronisation and connectivity with good temporal and spatial resolution. Here we reflect on the most promising new approaches to measuring network disruption in AD, LBD, PD, FTD, MS, and ALS. We consider the most groundbreaking and clinically promising studies in this field. We outline the limitations of these techniques and how they can be tackled and discuss how these novel approaches can assist in clinical trials by predicting and monitoring progression of neurophysiological changes underpinning clinical symptomatology. © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Past research has focused on the use and added value of PSS. While earlier studies have widely acknowledged the importance of context in determining the effectiveness of PSS, there has so far been no dedicated study of the influence of context on the use and added value of these tools in real planning workshops. To address this gap, we made an in-depth exploratory case study of a PSS, called the Adaptation Support Tool (AST), used in an adaptation planning workshop in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The workshop used the AST to support collaborative spatial planning for urban water management, at the neighbourhood scale. Interviews, questionnaires, observations and document review were used to investigate the influence of three contextual factors on the use and added value of the AST. The studied contextual factors are: 1) the style of tool use, 2) the phase of planning, and 3) the local project setting. Our findings indicate that the style of tool use and the local project setting were the most important contextual factors in determining the use and added value of the AST during the workshop. Meanwhile, the phase of planning appears to be critical for achieving impacts at the project level. This exploratory case study is a modest first contribution to understanding the influence of context on the use and added value of PSS in practice. Nevertheless, the findings indicate that further exploration of this topic could offer important insights to PSS use in practice.

Their OC stocks are crucial for a wide range of ecosystem services such as food security or climate regulation through atmospheric CO2 storage. There is increasing evidence that the controlling factors of OC stocks may differ between topsoil and subsoil, but distinct knowledge about the factors at a regional scale for temperate soils is scarce. In order to identify the controlling factors of OC storage in agricultural soils we implemented a random forest model on a data set of 692 soil profiles located in Bavaria, Southeast Germany. We differentiated between topsoil (0–30 cm profile depth) and subsoil (30–100 cm) and predicted OC stocks (kg OC m−2) using 13 predictor variables including soil type, topographical factors, climatic factors and information on land use. The explained variance of the topsoil random forest was higher than that of the subsoil (51 and 23%, respectively). The fact that major proportions of the variance in the modelling of subsoil OC remained unexplained, revealed high uncertainties that persist about subsoil OC storage. OC storage of both, topsoils and subsoils, was to a large extend determined by four factors: land use history, soil type, major landform and topographic wetness index (TWI). Climatic factors as well as clay content had surprisingly low impact on the model. Topsoil OC was mainly controlled by the legacy of the land use resulting in highest stocks under permanent grassland use. In contrast, soil type and topographical factors, i.e. major landform and TWI, largely determined subsoil OC stocks. The topography indicates the lateral transport of OC due to soil erosion and its subsequent deposition in low lying landform positions. There, high soil moisture as indicated by the TWI, hampers the decomposition of the OC. Human activities such as tillage amplify the lateral OC transport and therefore the amount of buried OC. As a result of these processes, highest subsoil stocks were found in alluvial, colluvial and groundwater affected soils. The findings demonstrate the close link between the generic soil type, topography, land use and OC stocks. We further conclude that the legacy of human activities affect both, topsoil and subsoil OC storage. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alluvial soils; Colluvial soils; Cropland; Grassland; Land use history; Random forest; Topography","Agriculture; Decision trees; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Food storage; Food supply; Groundwater; Landforms; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Topography; Uncertainty analysis; Alluvial soil; Colluvial soils; Cropland; Grassland; Land use history; Random forests; Land use; agricultural land; agricultural soil; air-soil interaction; algorithm; decomposition; environmental factor; grassland; land use change; landform; organic carbon; soil erosion; soil moisture; soil type; subsoil; topography; topsoil; Bavaria; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065097781

The research was conducted from April 1st to November 30th in 2012 and 2013 in a pilot plant located in San Michele di Ganzaria (Sicily, Italy) that treated urban wastewaters, studying Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (common reed), Arundo donax L. (giant reed), Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.) Roberty (vetiver) and Miscanthus x giganteus Greef et Deu. (miscanthus). Results showed a greater aboveground biomass yield in the second experimental year than the first one for all species except vetiver, which showed a 10.5% reduction. Considering CWs gases emission, a significantly higher CO2 emission (+52.5%) was monitored in 2013 than 2012 whereas CH4 had the opposite trend (−97.0%). Seasons and plant species influenced gases emission. The lower CO2 emission (median value 5.2 g m−2 d−1) was monitored during the spring seasons when instead was monitored the highest CH4 emission (median value 0.232 g m−2 d−1). Opposite CO2 and CH4 emissions were found in fall. A. donax, M. giganteus and P. australis determined significantly higher (2.9 times) CO2 emission than C. zizanioides and unvegetated bed. Vegetated beds showed a positive CO2(eq) total balance with the best results calculated for A. donax whereas, as expected, it was negative for the unvegetated bed, with a cumulative CO2(eq) emission of 6.68 kg m−2. Obtained results confirm the active and key role of plant species used in the CW systems and indicate A. donax as the most environmentally friendly species to use under Mediterranean climate conditions, followed by P. australis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arundo donax L.; Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.)

Public health agencies in the region do not have a consistent strategy for communication and health promotion targeting vulnerable communities about this climate-sensitive disease. We used the behavior adaptation communication model to design and conduct semi-structured interviews with representatives of public health agencies in five California counties: Fresno, Kern, Kings, San Luis Obispo, and Tulare County. While 263718699 of the agencies currently include climate change information into their Valley Fever risk messaging, the agencies discuss future communication methods similar to other health risk factors such as poor air quality days and influenza virus season. For political reasons, some public health agencies deliberately avoided the use of climate change language in communicating health risk factors to farmers who are particularly vulnerable to soil and dust-borne fungal spores. The effectiveness of health communication activities of the public health agencies has not been measured in reducing the prevalence of Valley Fever in impacted communities. Given the transboundary nature of climate influence on Valley Fever risk, a concerted and consistent health communication strategy is expected to be more effective than current practices. © 2019 by the authors.

Since cephalopods are typically elusive animals, the ecology of both species is poorly known. As beaks of cephalopods are recurrently found in top predator's stomachs, we studied the feeding ecology of both octopods through the evaluation of niche overlapping and specific beak adaptations that both species present. A multidisciplinary approach combining carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope signatures, mercury (Hg) analysis and biomaterials' engineering techniques was applied to investigate the beaks. An isotopic niche overlap of 95.6% was recorded for the juvenile stages of both octopod species, dropping to 19.2% for the adult stages. Both A. polymorpha and P. turqueti inhabit benthic ecosystems around South Georgia throughout their lifecycles (δ13C: −19.21 ± 1.87‰, mean ± SD for both species) but explore trophic niches partially different during adult life stages (δ15N: 7.01 ± 0.40‰, in A. polymorpha, and 7.84 ± 0.65‰, in P. turqueti). The beaks of A. polymorpha are less dense and significantly less stiff than in P. turqueti. Beaks showed lower mercury concentration relative to muscle (A. polymorpha - beaks: 0.052 ± 0.009 μg g−1, muscle: 0.322 ± 0.088 μg g−1; P. turqueti - beaks: 0.038 ± 0.009 μg g−1; muscle: 0.434 ± 0.128 μg g−1). Overall, both octopods exhibit similar habitats but different trophic niches, related to morphology/function of beaks. The high Hg concentrations in both octopods can have negative consequences on their top predators and may increase under the present climate change context. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomaterials; Cephalopods; Mercury; South Georgia; Stable isotopes; Sympatry","Biomaterials; Ecosystems; Isotopes; Mercury (metal); Molluscs; Muscle; Cephalopods; Engineering techniques; Environmental pressures; Mercury concentrations; Multi-disciplinary approach; South Georgia; Stable isotopes; Sympatry; Climate change; carbon 13; mercury; nitrogen 15; carbon; mercury; nitrogen; benthos; cephalopod; climate change; feeding ecology; mercury (element); morphology; niche overlap; stable isotope; sympatry; Adelieledone polymorpha; Article; cephalopod; chemical analysis; climate change; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; habit; muscle; nonhuman; Pareledone turqueti; porosity; predator; animal; Antarctica; beak; chemistry; diet; ecosystem; food chain; sympatry; Antarctica; South Georgia; Animalia; Cephalopoda; Octopoda; Pareledone turqueti; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Beak; Carbon Isotopes; Climate Change; Diet; Ecosystem; Food Chain; Mercury; Nitrogen Isotopes; Sympatry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068789205

These small scale factors commonly vary within peatlands and can cause variation in biogeochemical traits and carbon accumulation within the same site. To understand these within-site variations, we investigated long term carbon accumulation, peat decomposition, biogeochemistry of pore water and plant macrofossils along a transect in an ombrotrophic bog in southern Patagonia. An additional question we addressed is how historical deposition of volcanic ash on the peatland has affected its carbon balance. Variability in plant community and water table led to differences in long term peat and carbon accumulation (peat moss > cushion plant), organic matter decomposition (cushion plant > peat moss), and methane production (peat moss > cushion plant). Macrofossil analysis and radiocarbon dating indicated a relationship between plant community and carbon accumulation or decomposition during the historical succession of vegetation in the peatland. C/N ratio and isotopic signatures reflected variability in plant community as litter source, and DOC concentrations were controlled by humification level. Volcanic ash deposition had only limited effect on plant composition, but it was associated with increased decomposition in overlying peat layers. This study highlights the importance of understanding how plant communities develop, as changes in communities could significantly affect the potential of ombrotrophic peatlands as C sink. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon accumulation; Macrofossils; Microtopographic gradient; Organic matter mineralization; Southern peatlands; Stable isotopes","Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Deposition; Groundwater; Isotopes; Organic compounds; Peat; Volcanoes; Wetlands; Carbon accumulation; Macrofossils; Organic matter mineralization; Peat land; Stable isotopes; Carbon; carbon; methane; nitrogen; organic matter; water; carbon; bioaccumulation; biogeochemistry; carbon emission; carbon sink; microtopography; mineralization; organic matter; peatland; plant; stable isotope; Article; biogeochemistry; carbon balance; carbon sink; Chile; community succession; concentration (parameter); decomposition; humification; macrofossil; nonhuman; peatland; plant community; plant litter; priority journal; radiometric dating; Sphagnum; vegetation; volcanic ash; water table; Argentina; biota; metabolism; physiology; plant; wetland; Patagonia; Bryophyta; Argentina; Biota; Carbon; Plants; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066268672

This study marks the first attempt to combine environmental isotopes analysis with hydrometric and hydrogeological measurements to identify dominant recharge zones for springs in two mountainous catchments—Banlek and Shikarpur—in Far-Western Nepal. In total, 422 water samples collected from rainfall, springs and streams between March 2016 and March 2017 were analyzed for their isotopic composition (δ18O and δD). Isotopic composition of rainwater shows seasonality, suggesting that different sources of water vapor cause rains in monsoon and in dry season. Rainfall responses of individual springs were used to identify connections to unconfined and deeper groundwater strata. The isotopic composition of springs in the two catchments ranges from −9.55 to −8.06‰ for δ18O and −67.58 to −53.51‰ for δD. The isotopic signature of the spring sources falls close to the local meteoric water line for the corresponding season, indicating strong rainfall contribution to springs. Altitudinal isotopic gradients suggest mean recharge elevation of 2,600–2,700 m asl for springs in Shikarpur, which lies beyond the surface-water catchment, and a recharge elevation of 1,000–1,100 m asl for Banlek, which partially extends beyond the surface-water catchment. The demarcated recharge zones will be used by government agencies to implement recharge interventions to increase the resiliency and reliability of springs in Far-Western Nepal. © 2019, The Author(s).","Artificial recharge; Climate change; Interventions; Nepal; Stable isotopes","catchment; climate change; isotopic composition; rainwater; recharge; seasonality; stable isotope; water chemistry; water vapor; Pakistan; Shikarpur; Sind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066299518

Low particulate level and soot free emission can also be obtained due to presence of oxygen in these fuels. We can obtain a considerable fuel efficiency and sound mileage if we double the carbon in ethanol which contains more energy. The structure is more similar to iso-butanol. Iso-butanol is unique in alcoholic fuels due to its equatorial affinity for water. The worldwide energy policy also aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions occurred due to traditional fuels and thus developing renewable energy became an important part of this policy. Now-a-days transport sector has decreased its reliance on oil which generally contributes to hazardous environmental impact and to achieve this some alternative transport fuels such as biofuels, hydrogen and natural gas emerged up as a helping hand. Blending methanol into diesel and gasoline permits the mixture to possess an entire combustion with the presence of oxygen which increases its combustion efficiency and reduces greenhouse gas emission. Gasohol-a blend of gasoline and 10%methanol is available at plenty of petrol service stations as a regular automobile fuel within the United States. Brazil has successfully implemented and used methanol in terms of spark ignition engine operations as a fuel. Methanol has emerged up as a sustainable fuel for IC engines in past few decades because of its characteristics of soot free burning and higher efficiencies at less cost. The European Union decided to set 10% requirement of renewable energy in transport sector which is to be compiled with by 2020. In 2010, the transport sector utilized 4.70% of renewable energy out of which 91% was covered by biofuels. This paper discusses significance of methanol as a fuel for IC engines and its applicability in various sectors. © BEIESP.","Alcohol fuel; Anhydrous ethanol blends; Better fuel vaporization; High energy content; Higher blending octane; Iso-butanol",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073550999

Quantitative estimates of performances and costs are generated for a reference steelwork producing 4 Mton y−1 of hot rolled coil, where the fuel cell abates three major sources of CO2 emissions: i) power plant; ii) coke oven; iii) hot stoves. The MCFC-based system that removes CO2 and generates power includes a gas processing unit which produces nearly-pure CO2 for permanent storage (or-utilization) and hydrogen that can be conveniently used in the steel mill. The fuel cell operating conditions are adapted to the specific industrial application and its performances are predicted by an in-house process simulation tool. The techno-economic analysis finds conditions complying with the operating constraints of the fuel cell stacks while reducing direct CO2 emissions of the steel mill by more than 70% and achieving apparently interesting economic returns. In addition, the CO2 capture system generates large amounts of carbon-free electricity (up to 545 MWel) and hydrogen (up to 346 MWLHV) yielding a first law efficiency of approximately 60%. The synergistic production of decarbonized steel, hydrogen and electricity is key to the attractiveness the MCFC-CCS configuration proposed here: after assuming reasonable values for the “by-product” hydrogen and electricity and accounting for the CO2 avoidance they bring about, the estimated overall cost of CO2 avoided (CCA) ranges between 25 and-65 $ tonCO2−1. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; Hydrogen; Integrated steel mill; Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell; Retrofit","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Economic analysis; Fuel cell power plants; Hot rolling; Hydrogen; Hydrogen storage; Natural gasoline plants; Retrofitting; Steelmaking; Carbon-free electricity; First law efficiency; Integrated steel mills; Operating condition; Operating constraints; Quantitative estimates; Retrofit; Techno-Economic analysis; Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC); carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; cost analysis; energy efficiency; fuel cell; hydrogen; iron and steel industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067345877

In the last decade, the vegetation component within ESMs has witnessed great progress from simple ""big-leaf"" approaches to demographically structured approaches, which have a better representation of plant size, canopy structure, and disturbances. These demographically structured vegetation models typically have a large number of input parameters, and sensitivity analysis is needed to quantify the impact of each parameter on the model outputs for a better understanding of model behavior. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to diagnose the Community Land Model coupled to the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Simulator, or CLM4.5(FATES). Specifically, we quantified the first- and second-order sensitivities of the model parameters to outputs that represent simulated growth and mortality as well as carbon fluxes and stocks for a tropical site with an extent of 1×1°. While the photosynthetic capacity parameter (Vc;max25) is found to be important for simulated carbon stocks and fluxes, we also show the importance of carbon storage and allometry parameters, which determine survival and growth strategies within the model. The parameter sensitivity changes with different sizes of trees and climate conditions. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of the next generation of demographically enabled vegetation models within ESMs to improve model parameterization and structure for better model fidelity. © Author(s) 2019.",,"carbon cycle; climate change; demography; ecological modeling; growth; identification method; land surface; mortality; vegetation dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072621207

Its forests are shaped by wildfire events that affect ecosystem properties and climate feedbacks including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Improved understanding of boreal forest floor processes is needed to predict the impacts of anticipated increases in fire frequency, severity, and extent. In this study, we examined relationships between time since last wildfire (TSF), forest floor soil properties, and GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) along a Pleurozium schreberi-dominated chronosequence in mid- to late succession located in northern Sweden. Over three growing seasons in 2012–2014, GHG flux measurements were made in situ and samples were collected for laboratory analyses. We predicted that P. schreberi-covered forest floor GHG fluxes would be related to distinct trends in the soil properties and microbial community along the wildfire chronosequence. Although we found no overall effect of TSF on GHG emissions, there was evidence that soil C/N, one of the few properties to show a trend with time, was inversely linked to ecosystem respiration. We also found that local microclimatic conditions and site-dependent properties were better predictors of GHG fluxes than TSF. This shows that site-dependent co-variables (that is, forest floor climate and plant-soil properties) need to be considered as well as TSF to predict GHG emissions as wildfires become more frequent, extensive and severe. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","boreal forest; carbon dynamics; chronosequence; forest floor; greenhouse gas emissions; wildfire disturbance","biome; boreal forest; chronosequence; disturbance; forest ecosystem; forest floor; greenhouse gas; microbial activity; microbial community; respiration; soil property; succession; wildfire; Pleurozium schreberi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062644671

In particular, emissions from coal-fired power plants still have a substantial impact on both nearby and regional populations. Of particular concern is the potential for this impact to fall disproportionately on low-income communities and communities of color. We conducted a quantitative health impact assessment to estimate the health benefits of the proposed decommissioning of two coal-fired electricity generating stations in the Southern Front Range region of Colorado. We estimated changes in exposures to fine particulate matter and ozone using the Community Multiscale Air Quality model and predicted avoided health impacts and related economic values. We also quantitatively assessed the distribution of these benefits by population-level socioeconomic status. Across the study area, decommissioning the power plants would result in 2 (95% CI: 1–3) avoided premature deaths each year due to reduced PM2.5 exposures and greater reductions in hospitalizations and other morbidities. Health benefits resulting from the modeled shutdowns were greatest in areas with lower educational attainment and other economic indicators. Our results suggest that decommissioning these power plants and replacing them with zero-emissions sources could have broad public health benefits for residents of Colorado, with larger benefits for those that are socially disadvantaged. Our results also suggested that researchers and decision makers need to consider the unique demographics of their study areas to ensure that important opportunities to reduce health disparities associated with point-source pollution. ©2019.

The physical properties of the resultant mp-Si generated via magnesiothermic reduction, and thus the potential utility, are highly dependent on the specific reduction conditions utilized. Herein, we report a modified magnesiothermic reduction method which allows for the synthesis of high surface area mp-Si nanoparticles. The reaction was initiated at 650 °C and then cooled to a lower temperature to minimize heat-induced morphological damage. The nanoparticles were characterized by using powder X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopies, and N2 adsorption isotherm measurements. Particles prepared by using two-step annealing with the initial processing condition of 650 °C for 30 min followed by 300 °C for 4 h resulted in crystalline and completely reduced mp-Si with a high specific surface area of 542 ± 18 m2/g. mp-Si nanoparticles generated by using these specific parameters were further used for stoichiometric CO2 conversion to CH3OH, and the reaction yields were 2.5 times higher than prior reports, demonstrating usefulness in effecting an important chemical transformation. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","metallothermic reduction; nanomaterials; porous; sequestration; silicon; solid state","Carbon dioxide; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Porous silicon; Silicon; Silicon compounds; Silicon oxides; Synthesis (chemical); Transmission electron microscopy; High specific surface area; High surface area mesoporous; Magnesiothermic reduction; Metallothermic reduction; Photocatalytic water splitting; porous; Scanning and transmission electron microscopy; sequestration; Drug delivery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078555925

A new electrocatalyst for PEMFCs, an iodine doped grahene was prepared, characterized, and tested and the results are presented in this paper. We report a hybrid derived electrocatalyst with increased electrochemical active area and enhanced mass-transport properties. The electrochemical performances of several configurations were tested and compared with a typical Pt/C cathode configuration. As a standalone catalyst, the iodine doped graphene gives a performance with 60% lower than if it is placed between gas diffusion layer and catalyst layer. If it is included as microporous layer, the electrochemical performances of the fuel cell are with 15% bigger in terms of power density than the typical fuel cell with the same Pt/C loading, proving the beneficial effect of the iodine doped graphene for the fuel cell in the ohmic and mass transfer region.

In this context, the present study generates an economic optimization model to simulate how different tax scenarios would modify the behavior of regulated industrial sources considering the alternatives they have to minimize their costs (tax payment, fuel change and/or installation of abatement technologies). The main results show that, under the current tax scenario, CO2, PM and SO2 emissions would decrease by 11%, 48% and 49% respectively, while NOX emissions would increase by 5%. By extending the tax to all industrial sources regardless of their thermal power, CO2, PM and SO2 emissions would decrease respectively by 14%, 98% and 66%, while NOX emissions would increase by 7.1%.

Despite the ecological significance of bacterial communities, the integrated biogeography of planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in response to anthropogenic activities is not adequately understood. Here, we examined environmental parameters and the composition of planktonic and sedimentary bacteria in the Yulin River, a tributary of Three Gorges Reservoir, in response to changes in land use and dam construction. The results revealed that human-induced land use changes enhanced the nutrient concentrations in surface water and dam construction reduced the content of carbon and nitrogen in immediately downstream sediments. Intensified human-dominated land use showed a slight impact on sedimentary bacterial communities but largely reduced the diversity of planktonic bacterial communities. Moreover, human-induced land use changes increased the abundance of genes associated with denitrification, nitrification, and anammox in planktonic bacterial communities by 19.04%, 32.40% and 30.45%, respectively. In dam construction regions, the diversity and nutrient-related metabolic activity of sedimentary bacterial communities immediately downstream of the dam were decreased, whereas these changes were not observed in planktonic bacterial communities. Additionally, bacterial community composition was significantly related to nutrient concentrations variability and followed a distance-decay pattern. Furthermore, environmental effects explained more of the variation in planktonic bacterial community composition as compared with spatial effects did, whereas, sedimentary bacterial communities were more closely related to spatial effects. Our results demonstrated the distinct responses of planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities to anthropogenic activities, and offered new insight for understanding their potential ecological influence on rivers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial diversity; Biogeographic pattern; Physicochemical parameters; Riverine; Variation partitioning analysis","Dams; Ecosystems; Land use; Nitrogen removal; Nutrients; Reservoirs (water); Sedimentology; Surface waters; Wastewater treatment; Bacterial diversity; Biogeographic pattern; Physicochemical parameters; Riverine; Variation partitioning analysis; Bacteria; carbon; nitrogen; surface water; bacterium; biogeography; community composition; dam construction; fluvial deposit; human activity; land use change; microbial community; partitioning; physicochemical property; plankton; anammox bacterium; Article; bacterioplankton; case study; China; concentration (parameter); denitrification; environmental factor; land use; microbial community; nitrification; nonhuman; nutrient; priority journal; sediment; species composition; watershed; bacterial phenomena and functions; drug effect; environmental monitoring; lake; microbiology; physiology; plankton; river; water pollution; China; Three Gorges Reservoir; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; China; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Lakes; Plankton; Rivers; Water Microbiology; Water Pollution, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065853293

A two-dimensional analytical framework was developed based on a trichotomous policy instrument categorization and low-carbon city connotation. The results showed that the key goal of China’s low-carbon city construction is to develop low-carbon technology and low-carbon energy. Compulsory policy instruments are the most used and most effective, while voluntary policy instruments are rarely used. Further results indicated that when the ratio of compulsory instruments and mixed instruments comes to 2:1, the combination of policy instruments can lead to the optimal completion degree. It seems difficult to balance the stability of various policy instruments with the overall high completion degree. Chinese local governments are more accustomed to compulsory policy instruments.

Under these circumstances heating strategies of a variable valve train for a single-cylinder research diesel engine have been first simulated and then experimentally tested at the Institute of Internal Combustion Engines of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). By combining statistical experimental design (DoE) and 1-D gas exchange simulations, empirical DoE models for the design of suitable camshaft configurations have been established. After having performed a potential assessment, the most favorable configurations were manufactured and subsequently tested. The configuration with an additional opening of an outlet valve during the intake stroke (2nd Event) shows the best compromise between engine out HC/CO emissions and an efficient exhaust gas temperature increase. The strategy-related state changes in the combustion chamber when using a 2nd Event and the resulting soot characteristics, in terms of size and distribution, resulting reactivity and filter soot number, are subject of the second research phase. For the exact characterization of the resulting soot and for the detailed base collation, the size distribution and the soot reactivity were further investigated - in addition to the number of soot particles. In the context of these investigations, the internal engine soot formation and oxidation processes were analyzed by means of the extended two-color pyrometry. The final results of the direct comparison of the individual camshaft configurations help to make a statement at an early stage of the development process as to whether the effects of the heating strategy harmonize with the present aftertreatment system or need to be adapted to the new soot reactivity. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

However, because of historically low natural gas prices and cost reductions for onshore wind and photovoltaic technologies, recent new capacity deployment, especially in the United States, has come largely from these three generation sources. Here, we quantify competitive cost targets for three less-common zero-emission generation technologies—nuclear, concentrating solar, and offshore wind—under a range of future conditions. We determine the cost targets based on the technologies’ system value, such that technology value equals or exceeds its cost. Using a capacity expansion model that develops system-wide, economically optimal generation scenarios of the United States power sector, we find that nuclear, concentrating solar, and offshore wind would need to attain levelized cost ranges of $53–84/MWh, $65–91/MWh, and $39–77/MWh, respectively, to achieve 1% additional grid penetration. We refer to this metric as the “required cost,” which is a technology's levelized cost of energy needed to achieve a specific penetration level. Higher penetrations lead to lower required costs as lower-cost generation is displaced. We estimate that to reach 10% penetration, the required cost for nuclear declines to $45–76/MWh. Because of resource variability and increased transmission needs for concentrating solar power and offshore wind, even lower costs are needed to reach higher penetrations: required cost ranges to achieve 10% penetration are estimated to be $30–56/MWh and $18–40/MWh for these two technologies respectively.

However, in spite of an enormous amount of hydropower generation in Europe, no research has been carried out in evaluating the hazardous emissions from the plants located in alpine and non-alpine areas. Therefore, this paper will analyse the comparative environmental impacts of hydropower plants in alpine and non-alpine areas of Europe by a systematic life-cycle assessment (LCA)approach. The impacts are estimated by the ReCiPe 2016, Impact 2002+, Eco-points 97 methods under a number of effect-assessing indicators such as global warming, ozone formation, eco-toxicity, water consumption, acidification, eutrophication, ionizing radiation, carcinogenic radiation, ozone depletion, and land use. Moreover, the fossil-fuel-based power consumptions and the greenhouse-gas emissions in the life-cycle of hydropower plants in both locations are estimated using the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED)and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)methods, respectively. The outcomes reveal that hydropower plants of alpine regions offer a better environmental profile for the global-warming indicator (2.97×10-5 kg CO2-eq/MJ)than non-alpine plants (3.92×10-4 kg CO2-eq/MJ), but the effects are nearly identical for the other indicators. Overall, the hydropower plants of non-alpine regions are responsible for climate change with a rate 10 times as high as for alpine ones.

Monoethanolamine (MEA) in aqueous solution is the reference solvent to capture CO2 emission based on chemical absorption. However, aqueous solutions present some drawbacks, such as equipment corrosion, loss of solvent and high energy consumption. New and green solvents could be a possible solution to this issue. As part of this study, new experimental data on the solubility of carbon dioxide in monoethanolamine, MEA or diethanolamine DEA or methyldiethanolamine MDEA 30 wt%, dissolved in greener and nontoxic deep eutectic solvent (DES) made of choline chloride (ChCl) and ethylene glycol (EG) with a molar ratio of 1:2 are reported. Measurements were performed at three different temperatures; 298.1, 313.1 and 333.1 K and pressures from 2 Pa up to 800 kPa using astatic apparatus with on-line analysis of the gas phase by GC to determine the partial pressure of CO2. The dissolved CO2 in the liquid was determined by volumetric method. In a first step, the apparatus and the entire CO2 isotherm determination protocol were validated by the study of CO2 absorption in aqueous solution of MEA (reference amine). As no literature data was available, the solubilities of CO2 in the DES/amine were compared with those obtained from the aqueous media. The two set of measurements are very close. Gabrielsen et al. (2005) model of correlation based on the equilibrium constant, initially used for aqueous amine solutions, has been successfully extended to CO2 capture by nonaqueous solutions.

Many recent studies have attempted to quantify real-world emissions from trucks in cities. However, studies on real-world emission from trucks in India are scarce. In this study, we measured real-world emissions of gaseous pollutants (CO, HC, and NO) from twenty trucks of different sizes and emission standards. The trucks were classified into three categories (light-duty diesel trucks (LDDTs), medium-duty diesel trucks (MDDTs), and heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDTs)) based on their gross vehicle weight (GVW). The tested trucks conformed to Bharat Stage (BS) II, BS III, and BS IV emission standards. A vehicle specific power (VSP) based approach was adopted to model the relationship between vehicle activity and emissions. In addition, real-world emission factors of CO, HC, and NO for all the truck types were determined and compared based on their emission standard. Considerable reductions in emission factors were observed from lower to higher emission control standards for all the pollutants. The CO, HC and NO emission factors from the BS II standard LDDTs were 8.05 g/km, 0.86 g/km, and 8.04 g/km, respectively. The CO emission factor decreased by 29% and 65% respectively, for LDDTs and MDDTs with improved emission standards. The HC emissions (g/km) reduction from BS II to BS III for LDDTs and HDDTs were 49% and 8%, respectively. In the case of MDDTs, HC emission factor reduced by 16% from BS II to BS IV. On comparing with ARAI emission standards, we found that the emission factors of the trucks with GVW less than 3500 kg were higher for all the pollutants. In the case of trucks with GVW greater than 3500 kg, the CO emission factor for BS II and BS III complying trucks were higher than standard values while HC emission factors were lower than the standard values. Further, the emission factors of CO and NO from BS IV standard trucks were higher than the standard values. Moreover, emission factor values from our study were higher than that reported in the literature. Although India aims to adopt BS VI emission standards by 2020, phasing out older vehicles will be the key to mitigate emissions from diesel vehicles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Diesel; Emission factor; On-board measurement; Trucks","Air quality; Automobiles; Deterioration; Diesel engines; Emission control; Fog; Reduction; Diesel; Emission factors; Gaseous pollutants; Gross vehicle weight; On-board measurements; Operating condition; Real-world emission; Vehicle specific power; Trucks; air quality; atmospheric pollution; diesel; emission control; exhaust emission; operations technology; standard (regulation); trucking; air pollution control; air quality; artery; article; India; pollutant; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065908638

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that climate change already has significant impact on magnitude and frequency of flood events worldwide. Thus, it is suggested to adopt strategies to manage damage impacts of climate change. For this, involving the local community in the decision-making process, as well as experts and decision-makers, is essential. We focused on assessing the social acceptability of flood management strategies under climate change through a socio-hydrological approach using the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM). For this purpose as well, hydro-climate modelling and the Analytical Network Process (ANP) were used. Among twelve investigated flood management strategies, ""river restoration"", ""agricultural management and planning"", and ""watershed management"" were the publicly most accepted strategies. Assessment of the social acceptability of these three strategies was carried out by use of the CVM and Willingness to Pay (WTP) methodology. Generally, 50%, 38%, and 18% were willing to pay and 44%, 48%, and 52% were willing to contribute flood management strategy in zones 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Overall, peoples' WTP for flood management strategies decreased with increasing distance from the river. Among different investigated dependent variables, household income had the highest influence on WTP. © 2019 by the authors.","Analytical Network Process; Contingent valuation method; Flood management; Social acceptability; WTP","analytical hierarchy process; climate change; contingent valuation; decision making; flood; flood control; household income; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; strategic approach; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072616532

The stationarity and unit root properties of per capita carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions series are explored by an increasing amount of studies, which use different methodologies. Examining the time series properties of energy and environmental series is crucial for both researchers and the policymakers, given the close link between energy, environment and the real economy. In fact, if energy exhibits the presence of a unit root, this suggests that this series does not revert to its equilibrium level after being hit by a shock. Design/methodology/approach: The contribution of this work is twofold. First, to the author’s knowledge, a very little attention has been paid to the topics of stationarity and convergence of CO2 emissions in the case of Middle East and North Africa (MENA) member states, especially in a panel context. Convergence analyses of CO2 emissions for MENA countries can improve the knowledge of energy and environmental scenario of the area, giving some ideas for appropriate future policies. Second, this is the first study that jointly analyzed time series and panel data properties of emissions series for these countries. Findings: The author finds that relative per capita CO2 emissions in the 19 MENA countries are a mixture of I(0) and I(1) processes and there is a weak evidence to support the stationarity of CO2 emissions. After having verified the presence of cross-sectional dependence in the series, the panel unit root tests in presence of cross-section dependence show strong evidence in favor of non-stationarity. In addition, after performing tests for ß-convergence, it is also found that per capita CO2 emissions are converging on average in 11 out of 19 sample’s countries, while s-convergence analysis reveals that the variance of per capita CO2 emissions decreased over time, which is an indication of convergence. Originality/value: Important policy implications emerge from the empirical results. Sustainable environmental and energy policies rely heavily on the CO2 series’ properties. In this regard, determining whether shocks to CO2 emissions are permanent or transitory is important for setting feasible goals for sustainable environmental policies. Given that per capita CO2 emissions are essentially associated with a quality of life, the issues of their reduction have been the leading agenda in energy and environmental management over the past two decades. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CO2 emission; Convergence","Environmental management; Public policy; Sustainable development; Time series; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emissions; Convergence; Cross section dependence; Cross sectional dependence; Design/methodology/approach; Middle East and North Africa; Panel unit root tests; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062858784

The North Atlantic jet is mainly eddy-driven, with frequent north–south excursions on synoptic time scales arising from eddy forcings and feedbacks. There are, however, special periods during which the underlying dynamics appear to change—for example, winter 2009/2010, when the jet was persistently southward-shifted, extremely zonal, and more thermally driven. This study shows evidence that the southern jet configuration exhibits altered dynamical behavior involving a shift in the balance of thermal and eddy-driving processes, independent of timescale. Specifically, southern jets exhibit weaker eddy feedbacks and are associated with enhanced heating in the tropical Pacific. During winter 2009/2010, a remarkably frequent (66 days out of the 90-day winter season) and persistent southern jet shaped the unusual seasonal signature. These results bridge the synoptic and climate perspectives of jet variability, with potential to help understand and reduce biases in regional climate variability as simulated by models. © 2019 The Authors.

That being said, understanding the emissions footprint of different development types is becoming increasingly important in Canada, as the oil and gas sector faces new aggressive regulations to reduce CH4 emissions to 45% below 2014 levels by 2025. In this study, a vehicle-based measurement technique was used to quantify fugitive and vented CH4 emissions from the Weyburn CO2 Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) field in southeastern Saskatchewan, Canada. In total, 162 infrastructure sites consisting of 211 active wells and 13 facilities were sampled two or more times. Emission occurrences were substantially low in comparison to other recent emission studies in Canada and the United States, with only 1.85% of sampled sites emitting CH4. We estimated the average emission rate of CH4 at these sites to be ∼0.5 m3/day, which is small compared to the proposed 2020 federal venting cap of ∼110 m3/day. As expected, the low levels of emissions are likely a result of the field's unitized (closed-loop) design, coupled with the operators ongoing commitment to best practice, and the in-depth understanding of the field's characteristics from historical research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric; Enhanced Oil Recovery; Fugitive emissions; Methane; Monitoring; Multi-gas; Unitization","Atmospherics; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Methane; Monitoring; Oil fields; Petroleum industry; Anthropogenic sources; Average emission rate; Enhanced oil recovery; Fugitive emissions; In-depth understanding; Measurement techniques; Saskatchewan , Canada; Unitization; Enhanced recovery; anthropogenic source; atmospheric gas; carbon emission; concentration (composition); enhanced oil recovery; historical perspective; methane; research; Canada; Saskatchewan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066603355

The environment in Texas depends upon water discharged from the Edwards Aquifers, including ~1.5 million megaliters per year (ML/yr) from the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer and ~1 million ML/yr from the Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) Aquifer. The first people in the area used the aquifer springs as drinking water and subsequently irrigated with the springs’ flow and then began drilling and pumping wells. Well production in the Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) Aquifer was ~120,000 ML/yr in the 1930s and steadily increased over the next three decades to ~500,000 ML/yr, which is the average use from 1970 to 2015. Production from the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer was ~250,000 ML/yr from 1984 through 2016, while production from the Edwards-Trinity (High Plains) Aquifer was ~25,000 ML/yr from 1984 through 2016. The Interstate 35 growth corridor, extending from Bexar County (San Antonio) through New Braunfels, San Marcos, and Austin, Texas, and up to Bell County, is expected to grow from 4.6 million people in 2020 to 8.7 million in 2070. Despite the needs of this growing population, groundwater availability and regional water planning information suggests that pumping from the Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) Aquifer over the next 50 yr will be limited. Groundwater availability numbers suggest that pumping in the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer could double from current levels, although planning information currently projects a more modest increase. Unsettled groundwater law and climate change could also affect future levels of pumping. © 2019 The Geological Society of America.

The widespread application of renewable power systems meets the requirements of current developments in China. The development of renewable power systems is still faced with a certain degree of economic and policy obstacles such as high costs and ossified subsidy, etc. China's vast territory also determines that different regions have different objective development conditions, these uncertainties are not conducive to the development of renewable power systems. In this paper, 20 cities in five typical climate zones in China were selected. In consideration of climate and electricity tariff, the technical, economic and environmental performances of three types of the community-level grid-connected renewable power prototypes are compared by a full-year simulation, including basic photovoltaic power system, wind turbine system and biogas power system. Then, a comprehensive evaluation index is developed to evaluate the energy systems potential, which integrates all the technical, economic and environmental performance indicators. The advantages and disadvantages of renewable power system development in different regions were analyzed, to provide reference for China's green development and policy-making.It is found that biogas power system has comprehensive advantages in costs and electricity production for most cities,as the comprehensive evaluation index of BG in most cities is higher than that of PV and WT. In contrast, photovoltaic power system is not an economic option for the mojority of cities, except several cities where are rich in solar energy resources, such as Lhasa and Sanya.The comprehensive evaluation index of the photovoltaic system in Lhasa is 0.45, which is only lower than the wind power system in Shanghai among the 60 systems. In the southeast coastal cities with high average annual wind speed, such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, the wind power system has great potential for development. The comprehensive evaluation index of Shanghai wind power system is 0.489, which is the highest. The sensitivity analysis included in this study shows that the local grid purchase tariffs have greater impacts on systems lifetime costs than feed-in tariffs.The reduction of local grid purchase tariffs and the increase of feed-in tariffs are beneficial to the development of renewable power system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Potential evaluation; Renewable power systems; Simulation; Techno-economic analysis","Biogas; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy conservation; Environmental management; Photovoltaic cells; Sensitivity analysis; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Comprehensive evaluation index; Economic and environmental performance; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Potential evaluation; Renewable power generation systems; Renewable power systems; Simulation; Techno-Economic analysis; Electric power system economics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067185180

In this study, we analyzed the air pollution characteristics and their relationship with emissions and meteorology in the YRD region during 2014–2016. In recent years, the concentrations of all air pollutants, except O 3 , decreased. Spatially, the PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , and CO concentrations were higher in the northern YRD region, and NO 2 and O 3 were higher in the central YRD region. Based on the number of non-attainment days (i.e., days with air quality index greater than 100), PM 2.5 was the largest contributor to air pollution in the YRD region, followed by O 3 , PM 10 , and NO 2 . However, particulate matter pollution has declined gradually, while O 3 pollution worsened. Meteorological conditions mainly influenced day-to-day variations in pollutant concentrations. PM 2.5 concentration was inversely related to wind speed, while O 3 concentration was positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with relative humidity. The air quality improvement in recent years was mainly attributed to emission reductions. During 2014–2016, PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO x , CO, NH 3 , and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in the YRD region were reduced by 26.3%, 29.2%, 32.4%, 8.1%, 15.9%, 4.5%, and 0.3%, respectively. Regional transport also contributed to the air pollution. During regional haze periods, pollutants from North China and East China aggravated the pollution in the YRD region. Our findings suggest that emission reduction and regional joint prevention and control helped to improve the air quality in the YRD region. © 2019","Air pollution; Emission inventory; Meteorological condition; Regional transport; Spatiotemporal variation; Yangtze River Delta","Air pollution; Air quality; Ammonia; Economics; Emission control; Meteorology; Nitrogen oxides; Rivers; Volatile organic compounds; Wind; Emission inventories; Meteorological condition; Regional transport; Spatio-temporal variation; Yangtze river delta; River pollution; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; emission inventory; meteorology; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; pollutant transport; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfur dioxide; China; Yangtze Delta; ozone; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; China; environmental monitoring; meteorological phenomena; meteorology; particulate matter; river; season; statistics and numerical data; temperature; urbanization; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Meteorological Concepts; Meteorology; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Rivers; Seasons; Temperature; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063678323

In order to estimate the effects of local variables on temporal and spatial patterns of AGB we investigated the variation of AGB in a 20-ha sub-tropical permanent plot. We found that the AGB was 153.7 Mg ha-1 in 2005, and 149.3 Mg ha-1 in 2010. During the five-year period, AGB changed due to tree mortality, growth (diameter at breast height, DBH) and recruitment. Medium-sized trees (DBH: 30-50 cm) were the largest contributor to total AGB. Both the tree species diversity index and the number of individuals within medium (DBH: 30-50 cm) and large (DBH: &gt;50 cm) DBH ranges had significant positive effects on AGB. In addition, the abiotic factors such as elevation, slope, and convexity had negative significant relationships with AGB. The results indicate the importance of including forest community characteristics and environmental variables in forest carbon studies. This study also provides important data that can be used to develop and validate carbon cycling models for old-growth sub-tropical forests. © 2019 E-flow BioOne.

Nevertheless, there has been a long-standing ambiguity in whether changes in CaCO3 dissolution or changes in equatorial primary production might cause the variability. Since productivity and dissolution leave distinctive regional signals, a regional synthesis of data using updated age models and high-resolution stratigraphic correlation is an important constraint to distinguish between dissolution and production as factors that cause low CaCO3. Furthermore, the new chronostratigraphy is an important foundation for future paleoceanographic studies. The ability to distinguish between primary production and dissolution is also important to establish a regional carbonate compensation depth (CCD). We report late Miocene to Holocene time series of XRF-derived (X-ray fluorescence) bulk sediment composition and mass accumulation rates (MARs) from eastern equatorial Pacific Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) sites U1335, U1337, and U1338 and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) site 849, and we also report bulkdensity-derived CaCO3 MARs at ODP sites 848, 850, and 851. We use physical properties, XRF bulk chemical scans, and images along with available chronostratigraphy to intercorrelate records in depth space. We then apply a new equatorial Pacific age model to create correlated age records for the last 8 Myr with resolutions of 1-2 kyr. Large magnitude changes in CaCO3 and bio-SiO2 (biogenic opal) MARs occurred within that time period but clay deposition has remained relatively constant, indicating that changes in Fe deposition from dust is only a secondary feedback to equatorial productivity. Because clay deposition is relatively constant, ratios of CaCO3 % or biogenic SiO2 % to clay emulate changes in biogenic MAR. We define five major Pliocene-Pleistocene low CaCO3 % (PPLC) intervals since 5.3 Ma. Two were caused primarily by high bio-SiO2 burial that diluted CaCO3 (PPLC-2, 1685-2135 ka, and PPLC-5, 4465-4737 ka), while three were caused by enhanced dissolution of CaCO3 (PPLC-1, 51-402 ka, PPLC-3, 2248-2684 ka, and PPLC-4, 2915-4093 ka). Regional patterns of CaCO3 % minima can distinguish between low CaCO3 caused by high diatom bio-SiO2 dilution versus lows caused by high CaCO3 dissolution. CaCO3 dissolution can be confirmed through scanning XRF measurements of Ba. High diatom production causes lowest CaCO3 % within the equatorial high productivity zone, while higher dissolution causes lowest CaCO3 percent at higher latitudes where CaCO3 production is lower. The two diatom production intervals, PPLC-2 and PPLC-5, have different geographic footprints from each other because of regional changes in eastern Pacific nutrient storage after the closure of the Central American Seaway. Because of the regional variability in carbonate production and sedimentation, the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) approach is only useful to examine large changes in CaCO3 dissolution. © Author(s) 2019.

Regulators and researchers have widely recognized the necessity to put cities, as an important object of assessment, and city authorities, as an important actor group, at the core of climate mitigation efforts. For cities themselves this topic becomes a factor of competition among peers. In their pursuit of a low carbon future, however, they are confronted with a number of theoretical and practical questions regarding target setting and subsequent planning for mitigation. As a contribution to the current discussion, the paper initially clarifies on which principles the allocation and accounting of city-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are typically based. A good understanding of the GHG sources and reduction potentials is essential for defining feasible targets and designing efficacious reduction strategies. Built on this, the paper then presents how climate targets are defined at city level and analyses the methodological considerations that arise in the case of target-setting approaches involving bringing the emissions balance to zero. Although first definitions of ""net zero emission"" concepts on an urban scale can be found in literature, their precise meaning and applicability still remain vague, with unclear system boundaries, calculation and assessment rules. This paper provides a definition framework for clarifying such concepts. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Data on the total soil organic carbon (TOC) and labile organic carbon, including easily oxidizable organic carbon (EOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), of the soil profile were analysed for four typical agricultural land use scenarios in the Chengdu Plain, China. The impacts of agricultural land use changes on sequestration and nutrient availability of SOC were assessed in this urban agricultural area using the space-for-time substitution method. Conversion of land use from a traditional agricultural rotation (rice-wheat/rapeseed rotation) to afforestation increased the MBC content and decreased the contents of EOC, DOC, and TOC due to the lower input of organic matter, improved aeration of the soil profile, and growth of aboveground biomass. Conversion of a traditional rotation to a rice–garlic rotation resulted in a significant increase in topsoil TOC, slight but insignificant decreases in subsoil TOC, and clear increases in labile organic carbon because of rice planting, rice straw mulch, and reasonable application of chemical fertilizers. In contrast, the conversion of a traditional rotation to a rice–leafy vegetable rotation decreased MBC due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers that consequently increased EOC, DOC, and TOC. We conclude that afforestation on paddy soil has negative consequences for soil carbon sequestration and a rice–leafy vegetable rotation contributes to carbon sequestration but is detrimental to soil fertility. In addition, the MBC ratio in soil could be the optimal indicator for assessing SOC stability and soil fertility, and more attention should be paid to subsoil carbon changes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","agricultural land use change; labile organic carbon fractions; soil organic carbon; soil profile; urban agricultural area","Fertilizers; Land use; Nutrients; Reforestation; Rotation; Soils; Vegetables; Agricultural areas; Agricultural land use; Organic carbon fraction; Soil organic carbon; Soil profiles; Organic carbon; agricultural land; carbon sequestration; land use change; organic carbon; soil organic matter; soil profile; urban agriculture; urban area; Chengdu Plain; China; Sichuan; Allium sativum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071920631

Regular monitoring of LST using satellite sensors such as MODIS has the advantage of global coverage, including topographically complex regions such as Nepal. In order to assess the climatic and environmental changes, daytime and nighttime LST trend analysis from 2000 to 2017 using Terra-MODIS monthly daytime and nighttime LST datasets at seasonal and annual scales over the territory of Nepal was performed. The magnitude of the trend was quantified using ordinary linear regression, while the statistical significance of the trend was identified by the Modified Mann–Kendall test. Our findings suggest that the nighttime LST in Nepal increased more prominently compared to the daytime LST, with more pronounced warming in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. The annual nighttime LST increased at a rate of 0.05 K yr−1 (p &lt; 0.01), while the daytime LST change was statistically insignificant. Spatial heterogeneity of the LST and LST change was observed both during the day and the night. The daytime LST remained fairly unchanged in large parts of Nepal, while a nighttime LST rise was dominant all across Nepal in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. Our results on LST trends and their spatial distribution can facilitate a better understanding of regional climate changes. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Soot aggregate particles were identified near the landfill sites, which indicated that combustion pollution due to landfill activities was a significant source. High correlation coefficients (r) implied several inorganic elements and water-soluble inorganic ions (vanadium (V), copper (Cu), chloride (Cl−), nitrate (NO3−), sodium (Na) and potassium (K)) were positively associated with wind flow from the landfill sites. Nevertheless, no significant correlations were also identified between these components against DNA damage. Significant associations were observed between DNA damage and some heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), and total Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) during the summer.

However, the majority of research has focused on siliciclastic-related case studies, resulting in a knowledge gap surrounding the nomenclature and implications of carbonate-hosted cataclastic bands. We present a systematic case study of carbonate-hosted deformation bands in the Oligocene–Miocene Port Willunga Formation (PWF) exposures along the wave-cut platforms at Sellicks Beach, South Australia. Sellicks Beach provides an exceptional location to study carbonate-hosted deformation bands because of the unique juxtaposition of the carbonate grainstone PWF and the NE-SW striking Willunga Fault. The Willunga Fault is a steep SE-dipping active reverse fault that previously accommodated deposition in a Cenozoic half-graben. We have conducted a comprehensive structural analysis of 269 PWF deformation bands that formed as a result of strain induced by the Willunga Fault. Our model identifies three sets of shear-enhanced compaction bands (SECBs), and one set of pure compaction bands (PCBs) within the PWF. The PWF deformation bands display a range of cataclasis intensity defined by the percentage of microscopic fine-grained groundmass (gm), named here as crush micro-breccia (0–10% gm) and protocataclastic bands (10–50% gm), resulting from comminution, stylolite formation, and cementation. Petrophysical analysis indicates that crush micro-breccia bands reduce permeability between 0.0–0.75 orders of magnitude, and protocataclastic bands reduce permeability between 0.25–1.75 orders of magnitude relative to host rock. Our results indicate that PWF deformation bands are a useful proxy for cataclasis intensity, forming the foundation for a new classification scheme to describe cataclastic deformation bands, specifically applied to carbonate rocks. © 2019","Cataclasis intensity; Fault history; Mount Lofty Ranges; St. Vincent Basin; Willunga Fault","Beaches; Carbonation; Compaction; Deformation; Petrophysics; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Cataclasis; Cataclastic deformation; Classification scheme; Mount Lofty Ranges; Orders of magnitude; Petrophysical analysis; St. Vincent Basin; Structural evolution; Sedimentary rocks; breccia; carbonate rock; cataclasite; deformation; fault zone; mountain region; neotectonics; upper crust; Australia; Mount Lofty Ranges; Saint Vincent Basin; South Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065714902

Using fine particulate matter (PM2.5)concentration, land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)data obtained by satellite remote sensing, we analysed the inter-annual variations and trends in the urban environment of 17 megacities in Eurasia from 2000 to 2016. Taking the average environmental condition for all the megacities in 2000 as the baseline, the urban environmental conditions were evaluated by a Comprehensive Environmental Index (CEI)from 2001 to 2016. The variation and trends analysis of CEI revealed that the overall environmental conditions in Chennai, Dhaka, Kolkata and Tianjin showed significant deterioration trends. Environmental qualities in newly developed urban areas experienced degradation in Bangalore, Beijing, and Mumbai. The area of environmentally deteriorated urban land has been expanding in Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai in India and Dhaka in Bangladesh since 2001. By contrast, the area of environmentally degraded urban land in Chinese megacities expanded to the largest extent in the period of 2007–2009 and decreased afterwards.

Our comprehensive observations of atmospheric radicals and relevant parameters during several haze events in winter 2016 Beijing, however, reveal surprisingly high hydroxyl radical oxidation rates up to 15 ppbv/h, which is comparable to the high values reported in summer photochemical smog and is two to three times larger than those determined in previous observations during winter in Birmingham (Heard et al. Geophys. Res. Lett. 2004, 31, (18)), Tokyo (Kanaya et al. J. Geophys. Res.: Atmos. 2007, 112, (D21)), and New York (Ren et al. Atmos. Environ. 2006, 40, 252-263). The active photochemistry facilitates the production of secondary pollutants. It is mainly initiated by the photolysis of nitrous acid and ozonolysis of olefins and maintained by an extremely efficiently radical cycling process driven by nitric oxide. This boosted radical recycling generates fast photochemical ozone production rates that are again comparable to those during summer photochemical smog. The formation of ozone, however, is currently masked by its efficient chemical removal by nitrogen oxides contributing to the high level of wintertime particles. The future emission regulations, such as the reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions, therefore are facing the challenge of reducing haze and avoiding an increase in ozone pollution at the same time. Efficient control strategies to mitigate winter haze in Beijing may require measures similar as implemented to avoid photochemical smog in summer.

Therefore, there is a need to evaluate how competition regulates the climate-growth relationship in mature trees. We sampled the dominant tree species, Picea wilsonii Mast., on Xinglong Mountain, China, and studied the above issues by analyzing the relationship between tree radial growth, precipitation, and competition. In relatively wet years (precipitation > average), there was no significant difference in climate sensitivity between different competition classes. However, trees suffering from highly competitive stress were more sensitive to climate variability in all years, and particularly in the subset of years that was relatively drought (precipitation < average). These results suggest that competition enhances its ability to regulate tree growth response to climate variability in adverse weather conditions. Competition for resources between trees was asymmetrical, and an increase in height could give trees a disproportionate benefit. Thus, at trunk-level, both basal area incremental growth and intrinsic water-use efficiency of trees subjected to low competitive stress were significantly higher than trees that are subjected to highly competitive stress. Although the intrinsic water-use efficiency of trees under highly competitive stress increased more rapidly as the drought level increases, this did not change the fact that the radial growth of them declined more. Our research is valuable for the development of individual-tree growth models and advances our understanding for forest management under global climate change. © 2019 by the authors.","Allometry; Climate-growth relationship; Competition; Resources utilization; Tree rings","Biology; Climate change; Climate models; Competition; Drought; Efficiency; Research and development management; Allometry; Climate-growth relationship; Global climate changes; Individual tree growth models; Intrinsic water-use efficiencies; Resources utilizations; Short-lived species; Tree rings; Forestry; allometry; climate variation; competition (ecology); drought; forest management; growth; growth modeling; resource use; semiarid region; tree; tree ring; water use efficiency; Biology; China; Competition; Drought; Efficiency; Forestry; China; Picea wilsonii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072514977

There are three main interlinked sustainable energy development targets: increase in energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources, and GHG emission reduction. The significance of CSR in the energy sector is underlined based on the literature review, and the state policies to promote CSR in the energy sector are discussed and critically assessed based on the case studies of three Baltic States. The CSR practices of energy utilities of the Baltic States were assessed and compared with sustainable energy development achievements in these countries, based on the analysis of sustainable energy development trends. Estonia achieved the best results in approaching all sustainable energy development targets and was ranked with the highest scores in CSR ranking among the Baltic States, followed by Lithuania. The results of the case studies demonstrate that the Baltic countries have achieved different results in sustainable energy development progress, and the role of energy utilities and their corporate sustainability practices may have huge impacts on the achievement of sustainable energy development targets. © 2019 by the authors.","Baltic States; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate social responsibility reports; Energy utilities; Sustainable energy development indicators","Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Baltic state; Comparative analysis; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Corporate-sustainability; Energy utilities; Sustainable energy development; Theoretical framework; Use of renewable energies; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071931942

It is a worldwide evaluation with consideration of socio-economic, geo-hydrological, climate, and groundwater factors. Results display where ATES is likely placed or has the potential for application, which show that nearly 7% of the region is a “very good” ATES prospect zone, 20% is a “good” zone, 34% is a “moderate” zone, 27% is a “poor” zone, and nearly 12% is a “very poor” zone. The combination of potential and urban maps presents potential cities suitable for large-scale application of ATES.

It causes lymph nodes and pulmonary tuberculosis in patients living in countries of the Horn of Africa, including Djibouti. The environmental reservoirs of M. canettii are still unknown. We aimed to further decrypt these potential reservoirs by using an original approach of High-Throughput Carbon and Azote Substrate Profiling. The Biolog Phenotype profiling was performed on six clinical strains of M. canettii and one M. tuberculosis strain was used as a positive control. The experiments were duplicated and authenticated by negative controls. While M. tuberculosis metabolized 22/190 (11%) carbon substrates and 3/95 (3%) nitrogen substrates, 17/190 (8.9%) carbon substrates and three nitrogen substrates were metabolized by the six M. canettii strains forming the so-called corebiologome. A total at 16 carbon substrates and three nitrogen substrates were metabolized in common by M. tuberculosis and the six M. canettii strains. Moreover, at least one M. canettii strain metabolized 36/190 (19%) carbon substrates and 3/95 (3%) nitrogen substrates for a total of 39/285 (13%) substrates. Classifying these carbon and nitrogen substrates into ten potential environmental sources (plants, fruits and vegetables, bacteria, algae, fungi, nematodes, mollusks, mammals, insects and inanimate environment) significantly associated carbon and nitrogen substrates metabolized by at least one M. canettii strain with plants (p = 0.006). These results suggest that some plants endemic in the Horn of Africa may serve as ecological niches for M. canettii. Further ethnobotanical studies will indicate plant usages by local populations, then guiding field microbiological investigations in order to prove the definite environmental reservoirs of this opportunistic tuberculous pathogen. © 2019 Loukil et al.

In this work we have synthesized a new 2,3,6,7-tetramethoxy-9,10-di-p-tolylanthracene-bridged pillar[5]arene dimer with persistent mazarine blue fluorescent emission and much higher quantum yields in both solution and the solid state in comparison with its corresponding emissive linker without pillarene units, which exhibits typical aggregation-caused quenching. According to the fluorescence data and single-crystal analyses, their contrasting fluorescent performances can be rationally ascribed to their different stacking structures and intermolecular interactions. Three fluorescent guests containing different chromophores and/or terminal binding sites have also been synthesized to interact with the pillar[5]arene dimer to construct supramolecular ensembles with highly controllable luminescence, taking advantage of the stimuli-responsive properties of the supramolecular host–guest interactions. Intriguingly, multicolor fluorescence, including white-light emission (0.31, 0.35), which is in high demand, has been achieved by tuning the molar ratio of the host and guest and/or by changing the solvent system. This strategy holds great potential for the design and development of fluorescent materials with high quantum yields, controllable emission wavelength, and good stimuli-responsiveness. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, none of them allow to cover the whole steps included from analyzing climate trends that could affect the cities, to NBS effectiveness. This paper reviews and classifies existing methods according to the relevant steps of climate resilience and NBS effectiveness, and a combination of various of those methods is presented in a practical case study. Bottom-up city energy, economic and environmental modelling have been performed to understand mitigation effects of NBS implementation at building and neighborhood level. Urban hydrodynamics and fluid dynamics have been modelled too, allowing the estimation of the adaptation effectiveness of the NBS scenarios in flooding and temperatures reduction respectively. Moreover, city vulnerability and urban risks, considering IPCC scenarios regarding climate trends, have been assessed to understand the areas of the city more vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Results show that strategies and climate hazards has been worked in a split way and there is a need to connect better mitigation and adaptation information to facilitate the municipalities taking robust decisions regarding the NBS implementation. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

In 1996, China launched the Green Light Program (GLP), which became a national energy conservation activity for saving lighting electricity as well as an effective reduction of the coal consumption for power generation. Despite the great success of the GLP, its effects on haze have not been investigated and well understood. This study focused on assessing the potential coal saving induced by the improvement of luminous efficacy, the core of the GLP, and on estimating the consequent effects on the haze in the North China Plain (NCP), where a large number of power plants are located and are often engulfed by severe haze. The estimated potential coal saving induced by the GLP can reach a massive value of 120-323 million tons, accounting for 6.7 %-18.0% of the total coal consumption for thermal power generation in China. There was a massive potential emission reduction of air pollutants from thermal power generation in the NCP, which was estimated to be 20.0-53.8 Gg for NOx and 6.9- 18.7 Gg for SO2 in December 2015. The potential emission reduction induced by the GLP plays important roles in the haze formation, because the NOx and SO2 are important precursors for the formation of particles. To assess the impact of the GLP on haze, sensitivity studies were conducted by applying a regional chemical-dynamical model (WRFCHEM). The model results suggest that in the case of lowerlimit emission reduction, the PM2.5 concentration decreased by 2-5 μgm-3 in large areas of the NCP. In the case of upperlimit emission reduction, there was much more remarkable decrease in PM2.5 concentration (4-10 μgm-3). This study is a good example to illustrate that scientific innovation can induce important benefits for environment issues such as haze. © Author(s) 2019.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071948809

These soil emissions were measured from three horticultural production systems in Quebec and Ontario, Canada, for the following crops: (1) cranberry production in an artificial bog on sandy soil; (2) tomato production on a conventionally farmed loamy sand soil; and, (3) onion production on an organic soil. In-situ soil N2O, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were measured at each site using the non-steady-state static chamber method. Tomato production on the loamy sand and onion production on the organic soils were the greatest producers of soil GHG emissions, with highest global warming potentials of 11,000 kg CO2-eq ha−1 and 7800 kg CO2-eq ha−1, respectively. The cranberry crop had the lowest global warming potential (2700 kg CO2-eq ha−1). Water management (water table depth, subsurface and surface drip irrigation) had a negligible impact on soil GHG emissions. The main factors influencing the production of N2O were spring thaw, rate and timing of inorganic fertilizers, and precipitation. Soil CO2 fluxes were primarily governed by soil temperature. Soil CH4 fluxes were low, as the soils from all crops were both oxidizing and producing CH4 simultaneously. Production of CH4 increased when the cranberry fields were flooded. Organic and mineral soils produced comparable amounts of soil greenhouse gas emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Organic soils; Vegetable production; Water management","Carbon dioxide; Crops; Fruits; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Indium compounds; Irrigation; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Water management; Global warming potential; Inorganic fertilizers; Nitrous oxide; Organic soil; Static chamber method; Surface drip irrigations; Vegetable productions; Water table depths; Soils; agricultural soil; carbon dioxide; crop production; emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; horticulture; loamy sand; methane; nitrous oxide; organic soil; precipitation (climatology); sandy soil; temperate environment; vegetable; water management; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Quebec [Canada]; Allium cepa; Lycopersicon esculentum; Vaccinium macrocarpon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065081297

However, it is often difficult to estimate the attainable yields in smallholder farm agriculture. In this study, we estimated the yield gaps in irrigated wheat in the Hebei Province in China using data from farmer surveys and crop modeling. The EPIC (Environment Policy Integrated Climate) model was calibrated and evaluated for high-yielding wheat experiments in Hebei Province to estimate the Yp at the county level. The model was run for 10 yr (2005–2014) using county-level weather data, and the area-weighted average model-based estimate of Yp was 9.93 Mg ha–1 across 116 counties in Hebei Province, which was higher than the estimate of approximately 9.0 Mg ha–1 that was reported in previous studies. The attainable yield potential (Ya) during this period was defined as the mean yield of the top 5% of farmers, and the actual farm yield (Yf) in these counties was calculated based on a survey of 385,167 farmers. The area-weighted average Yf was 6.47 Mg ha–1, corresponding to 65.2% of the model-based estimate of Yp. The total yield gap was high at 3.46 Mg ha–1.

Focusing on plant young and old leaves could provide new insights to low nitrogen tolerance research. This study compared the low nitrogen group with the control group on physiological and metabolomics changes in young and old leaves, respectively, then analyzed and compared the differences of these changes between cultivated and wild soybean. This study aimed to provide a theoretical basis for the molecular mechanism of soybean low nitrogen stress tolerance. Results: Wild soybean was less affected by low-nitrogen stress than cultivated soybean as assessed by plant biomass paraments, total carbon content and total nitrogen content. Gas-exchange coefficients and chlorophylls contents maintained relatively stable in wild soybean young leaves, but opposite in cultivated soybean. Wild soybean young leaves also increased the transport of beneficial ions, such as B3+, Fe3+, Mn2+, H2PO4 - and C2O4 2-. In wild soybean old leaves, the nitrogen metabolism pathway was significant enhanced, especially the aspartic acid and GABA metabolisms. While in cultivated soybean, the nitrogen metabolism decreased obviously in young leaves but had no significant change in old leaves. The phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway was also activated in wild soybean. Contrary to cultivated soybeans, wild soybean tricarboxylic acid cycle and carbon metabolism including polyols and organic acids consolidated in old leaves and maintained a relative normal state in young leaves. These strategies could improve the antioxidant and N-fixation capacity in wild soybean. Conclusion: The survival and growth of wild soybean under low nitrogen stress conditions relied on physiological adjustments and metabolic changes that occurred at the cellular level. Compared with cultivated soybean, wild soybean young leaves could maintain a relatively normal growth mainly owing to a significant enhancement of key amino acids and nonprotein nitrogen metabolism in old leaves, especially aspartic acid, proline metabolism which provided basis for nitrogen reutilization from old leaves to young leaves. Consolidating the tricarboxylic acid cycle, intensifying phenylpropanoid metabolism, and accumulating more polyols and organic acids also had positive effect on it. © 2019 The Author(s).","Gas exchange; Ionomics; Low nitrogen; Metabolomics; Old leaves; Soybean; Young leaves","nitrogen; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; metabolism; metabolome; metabolomics; physiological stress; physiology; plant leaf; seedling; soybean; Genotype; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Nitrogen; Plant Leaves; Seedlings; Soybeans; Stress, Physiological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071896787

The latter is measured by both the degree centrality (to reflect connectivity) and the harmonic centrality (to reflect accessibility). Using a sample of 46 airports in China and a sample of 16 airports in Japan over the period of 2007–2015, we conduct regression analysis and compare the effects of HSR network development on airports in these two Northeast Asian countries. We find that as HSR connectivity or accessibility increases, there is, on average, a decline in airports’ domestic and total traffic in China but little change in Japan. Meanwhile, we observe a strong complementary effect of HSR to feed international flights with the presence of air-HSR intermodal linkage. As a result, some airports may experience a total traffic increase. In China, hub airports tend to gain traffic regardless the availability of air-HSR linkage, while non-hub airports are likely to lose. In Japan, on the other hand, airports with air-HSR linkage tend to gain traffic regardless the hub status. Our analysis also reveals some differentiated impacts of HSR connectivity and accessibility in China. An important policy implication is that the investment in air-HSR intermodal linkage at busy airports may not help with realizing the benefit of congestion mitigation and emission reduction. Rather, policy makers may invest air-HSR linkage at regional airports which have the potential to be converted into international gateway hubs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air-HSR intermodal; Airport traffic; Degree centrality; Harmonic centrality; High-speed rail; Substitutability and complementarity","Emission control; Gateways (computer networks); Public policy; Railroad transportation; Regression analysis; Traffic congestion; Airport traffic; Degree centrality; Harmonic centrality; High speed rail; Substitutability and complementarity; Airports; accessibility; airport; high-speed train; policy making; traffic congestion; traffic management; transportation development; transportation policy; China; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069724269

Although there are many long term opportunities to address these issues with integrated policies, the immediate needs of addressing air pollution and climate change mitigation are not the same for all countries in the short run. We examined the relationships between greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, outdoor air pollution, and levels of socioeconomic development to identify specific near-term mitigation policy responses to climate change and air pollution for countries with different levels of human development. Human development index, as defined by The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is a measure of achievement in the basic dimensions of human development across countries, which combines the gross national income index, an education index and a life expectancy index (http://hdr.undp.org/en/humandev). Country-level data were collected on indicators of socioeconomic development, emissions of GHG, and outdoor levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from the World Bank, the UNDP, and the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution. Differences in GHG emissions and air pollution concentrations, as well as socioeconomic development indicators, were assessed at national, sub-national, and global scales. Countries were divided into four categories based on CO2 emissions per capita and an estimation of outdoor PM2.5: Group A was characterized by high CO2 emissions per capita and low PM2.5 concentrations, Group B by high CO2 emissions per capita and high PM2.5 concentrations, Group C by low CO2 emissions per capita and low PM2.5 concentrations, and Group D by low CO2 emissions per capita and high PM2.5 concentration. Per-capita emissions of CO2 were strongly correlated with the level of socioeconomic development, while differences in non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions per capita across the groups were not correlated. Atmospheric PM2.5 concentrations were not correlated with either CO2 emissions per capita or levels of socioeconomic development. Energy and environmental policies focused on CO2 emission reductions may not inherently lead to development pathways that sufficiently reduce population exposure to air pollution. Countries with low CO2 and high air pollution levels should pursue short-term policies to reduce air pollution and increase human development, beginning to address GHG emissions after critical human health and development needs are met. © 2019 The Author(s)","CO2; GHG; PM2.5; Public health; Short-term policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079523086

Adjusting planting density is one of the most effective measures for maximizing cotton yield under certain climatic conditions. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the optimum planting density and the corresponding leaf area index (LAI) and yield under the climatic conditions of Henan Province, China, and (2) to learn how climatic conditions influence cotton growth, yield, and yield components. A three-year (2013–2015) field experiment was conducted in Anyang, Henan Province, using cultivar SCRC28 across six planting density treatments: 15,000, 33,000, 51,000, 69,000, 87,000, and 105,000 plants ha−1. The data showed that the yield attributes, including seed cotton yield, lint yield, dry matter accumulation, and the LAI, increased as planting density increased. Consequently, the treatment of the maximum density with 105,000 plants ha-1 was the highest-yielding over three years, with the LAIs averaged across the three years being 0.37 at the bud stage, 2.36 at the flower and boll-forming stage, and 1.37 at the boll-opening stage. Furthermore, the correlation between the cotton yield attributes and meteorological conditions indicated that light interception (LI) and the diurnal temperature range were the climatic factors that most strongly influenced cotton seed yield. Moreover, the influence of the number of growing degree days (GDD) on cotton was different at different growth stages. These observations will be useful for determining best management practices for cotton production under the climatic conditions of Henan Province, China. © 2019 Liu et al.

However, HFC-410A is also one of the strong greenhouse gases (GHGs)and will be regulated under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. In this study, an updated HFC-410A emission inventory for China's RAC sector is established for the period of 2006–2017 with a projection to 2050 based on a bottom-up method. Our estimation indicates that the HFC-410A emissions increased from 0.0092 Gg yr−1 to 12.0 Gg yr−1 with an annual increase of 115.7%/yr during 2006–2017. More than 95% of the emissions were from end-of-life process. Under a business-as-usual (BAU)scenario, projected emissions will continuously grow to 89.2 (54.8–126.0)Gg yr−1 in 2050.

This paper used experimental data (including images of flame natural luminosity) to investigate the magnitude and phasing of these two combustion stages. The results showed a substantial impact on the parameters generally used to investigate the combustion phenomena in spark-ignition engines (e.g., the 10-to-90-percent energy release). A better solution to identify the start and end of the rapid- and the slow-burning stages in such an engine is to use the inflection points in the apparent rate of heat release. Moreover, as the higher turbulence in a diesel-like environment accelerates flame inception, the 5% or 10% energy release used traditionally to define the flame inception period should not be used for these engines because the enflamed zone already reached an appreciable size at the two corresponding crank angle degrees. Further, the 2nd inflection point in the apparent rate of heat release (i.e., the point where the slow-burning stage started to dominate the heat release) was much advanced compared to 90% energy release generally used to define the end of the rapid-burning stage in conventional stoichiometric spark-ignition engines. Furthermore, as the slow-burning stage was characterized by a lower flame propagation speed, a lower fuel fraction burning during this stage would increase the engine combustion efficiency. Furthermore, a more advanced phasing of the late-burning stage relative to the fast-burn stage would result in a more optimal combustion environment (i.e., higher in-cylinder pressure and temperature), which would further improve the engine efficiency and probably reduce carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions. As a result, this study suggests that the combustion strategy of such converted diesel engines should advance and optimize the mass of fuel that burns inside the squish region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bowl-in-piston chamber; Diesel engine; Natural gas; Spark ignition; Two-stage combustion","Carbon monoxide; Diesel engines; Ignition; Natural gas; Pistons; Bowl-in-piston chamber; Combustion efficiencies; Combustion phenomena; Flame propagation speed; In-cylinder pressures; Spark ignition; Two stage combustion; Unburned hydrocarbons; Engine pistons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068939262

Within China, more than 60% of CO2 emissions originate from high energy-intensive (HEI) industries. Therefore, controlling and reducing CO2 emissions from HEI industries is crucial if China is to achieve its 2030 emission reduction targets. This study aims to investigate regional differences in the impact of HEI industries on CO2 emissions in China. This paper presents an analysis of the impact of HEI industries on CO2 emissions at the national and regional levels using a modified STIRPAT model and provincial panel data from 2000 to 2015 in China. The results show that HEI industries are significant contributors to China’s CO2 emissions owing to the growth in industries, coal-based energy structure, low level of technology, and outstanding conduction effects. The impact intensity of HEI industries on CO2 emissions decreases from the western to the central and eastern regions in China because of a huge regional difference in industrial structure, energy structure, R&amp;D investment, and industrial transfer.

Yet, due to geospatial variations of CO2 emissions in different cities, it is important to develop city-specific policies and tools to help control and reduce CO2 emissions. The key question is how to identify and quantify these variations so as to provide reference for the formulation of the corresponding mitigation policies. This paper attempts to answer this question through a case study of 26 cities in the Yangtze River Delta. The CO2 emissions pattern of each city is measured by two statistics: Gini coefficient to describe its quantitative pattern and Global Moran's I index to capture its spatial pattern. It is found that Gini coefficients in all these cities are all greater than 0.94, implying a highly polarized pattern in terms of quantity; and the maximum value for Global Moran's I index is 0.071 with a standard deviation of 0.021, indicating a weak spatial clustering trend but strong difference among these cities. So, it would be more efficient for these cities at current stage to reduce CO2 emissions by focusing on the large emission sources at certain small localities, particularly the very built-up areas rather than covering all the emission sources on every plot of the urban prefectures. And by a combination of these two metrics, the 26 cities are regrouped into nine types with most of them are subject to type HL and ML. These reclassification results then can serve as reference for customizing mitigation policies accordingly and positioning these policies in a more accurate way in each city. © 2019","CO2; Emission pattern; Gini coefficient; Global Moran's I index; Yangtze River Delta","Climate change; Economics; Rivers; Climate change mitigation; Emission pattern; Gini coefficients; Global Moran's I index; Mitigation policies; Spatial clustering; Standard deviation; Yangtze river delta; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; pollutant source; pollution policy; quantitative analysis; spatial variation; urban pollution; air pollution; Article; carbon footprint; case study; China; city; classification; cluster analysis; controlled study; environmental protection; geography; Gini coefficient; Global Moran I index; policy; statistical analysis; trend study; urban area; chemistry; climate change; environmental monitoring; procedures; river; China; Yangtze Delta; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068388399

The crystal structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD)and the structure information was refined by the Rietveld method. The luminescence properties of Na2ZnSiO4:Mn2+ phosphors as a function of Mn2+ concentrations were investigated. The excitation band peaking at ∼359, 383, 427, 449, and 467 nm are attributed to ground level 6A1(6S)to excited levels 4E(4D), 4T2(4D), [4A(4G), 4E(4G)], 4T2(4G), and 4T1(4G)transitions of Mn2+ ion, respectively, which indicates that Na2ZnSiO4:Mn2+ phosphor may be excited by (near)ultraviolet and blue region light-emitting diode chip. The narrow emission band peaks at ∼515 nm generated by 4T1(4G)→6A1(6S)transition of the Mn2+ can exhibit strong green emission. The luminescence mechanism was explained by the Tanabe-Sugano diagram. The optimum Mn2+ doping concentration was 0.5 mol%. The critical distance between Mn2+ was calculated to be 33.7 Å. The concentration quenching mechanism can be interpreted by the dipole-dipole interaction of Mn2+ ions. With the Mn2+ doping concentration increasing in the range of 0.2–0.8 mol%, the lifetime of this phosphor decreased from 7.51 to 7.39 ms. These phosphors also possessed good thermal stability at high temperature, and the emission intensity at 125 °C was about 74.9% of that at 25 °C.

There is a need for systematic approaches to evaluation of health outcomes and climate impacts relevant to BC exposure. Objectives: We propose and illustrate for the first time, to our knowledge, an integrated analysis of a region-specific health model with climate change valuation module to quantify the health and climate consequences of BC exposure. Methods: Based on the data from regional air pollution monitoring stations from 2013 to 2014 in the Pearl River Delta region (PRD), China, we analyzed the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects and the relative risk of cause-specific mortality due to BC exposure in three typical cities of the PRD (i.e. Guangzhou, Jiangmen and Huizhou). The radiative forcing (RF) and heating rate (HR) were calculated by the Fu-Liou-Gu (FLG) plane-parallel radiation model and the conversion of empirical formula. We further connected the health and climate impacts by calculating the excess mortalities attributed to climate warming due to BC. Results: Between 2013 and 2014, carcinogenic risks of adults and children due to BC exposure in the PRD were higher than the recommended limits (1 × 10−6 to 1 × 10−4), resulting in an excess of 4.82 cancer cases per 10,000 adults (4.82 × 10−4) and an excess of 1.97 cancer cases per 10,000 children (1.97 × 10−4). Non-carcinogenic risk caused by BC was not found. The relative risks of BC exposure on mortality were higher in winter and dry season. The atmospheric RFs of BC were 26.31 W m−2, 26.41 W m−2, and 22.45 W m−2 for Guangzhou, Jiangmen and Huizhou, leading to a warming of the atmosphere in the PRD. The estimated annual excess mortalities of climate warming due to BC were 5052 (95% CI: 1983, 8139), 5121 (95% CI: 2010, 8249) and 4363 (95% CI: 1712, 7032) for Guangzhou, Jiangmen and Huizhou, respectively. Conclusion: Our estimates suggest that current levels of BC exposure in the PRD region posed a considerable risk to human health and the climate. Reduction of BC emission could lead to substantial health and climate co-benefits. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Black carbon; Climate change; Exposure; Health risk assessment; Radiative forcing","black carbon; carbon; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; climate change; climate effect; health risk; integrated approach; mortality; pollution exposure; public health; radiative forcing; risk assessment; adult; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; atmosphere; child; China; circadian rhythm; climate; climate change; health hazard; heating; human; malignant neoplasm; mortality; priority journal; public health; radiative forcing; risk assessment; risk factor; river; time series analysis; winter; air pollutant; city; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; soot; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Huizhou; Jiangmen; Zhujiang Delta; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon; Child; China; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment; Soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067000961

Nevertheless, nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions control for lean-burn gasoline for meeting the stringent Environmental Protection Agency tier 3 emission standards has been one of the main challenges toward the commercialization of highly efficient lean-burn gasoline engines in the United States. Passive selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, which consist of a three-way catalyst (TWC) and SCR, have demonstrated great potentials of effectively reducing NOx emissions for lean gasoline engines at low cost. However, passive SCR operation may cause significant fuel penalty since rich engine combustion is required for ammonia generation. The purpose of this study is to develop a model-predictive control (MPC) scheme for a lean-burn gasoline engine coupled with a passive SCR system to minimize the total equivalent fuel penalty associated with passive SCR operation while satisfying stringent NOx and ammonia (NH3) emissions requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the MPC approach can reduce the fuel penalty by 43.9% in a simulated US06 cycle and 28.0% in a simulated urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) cycle, respectively, compared to the baseline control, while achieving over 97% DeNOx efficiency and less than 15 ppm tailpipe ammonia slip. The proposed MPC controller can potentially enable highly efficient lean-burn gasoline engines while meeting the stringent Environmental Protection Agency tier 3 emission standards.

The empirical results indicate that economic infrastructure construction will increase energy consumption and reduce the energy intensity in the long term. Although the energy consumption effect of infrastructure in the central and western regions is less than that in the eastern region, the energy intensity of the western region declines the most due to the infrastructure construction.

We characterize human mortality and morbidity costs associated with 10 climate-sensitive case study events spanning 11 US states in 2012: wildfires in Colorado and Washington, ozone air pollution in Nevada, extreme heat in Wisconsin, infectious disease outbreaks of tick-borne Lyme disease in Michigan and mosquito-borne West Nile virus in Texas, extreme weather in Ohio, impacts of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey and New York, allergenic oak pollen in North Carolina, and harmful algal blooms on the Florida coast. Applying a consistent economic valuation approach to published studies and state estimates, we estimate total health-related costs from 917 deaths, 20,568 hospitalizations, and 17,857 emergency department visits of $10.0 billion in 2018 dollars, with a sensitivity range of $2.7–24.6 billion. Our estimates indicate that the financial burden of deaths, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and associated medical care is a key dimension of the overall economic impact of climate-sensitive events. We found that mortality costs (i.e., the value of a statistical life) of $8.4 billion exceeded morbidity costs and lost wages ($1.6 billion combined). By better characterizing health damages in economic terms, this work helps to shed light on the burden climate-sensitive events already place on U.S. public health each year. In doing so, we provide a conceptual framework for broader estimation of climate-sensitive health-related costs. The high health-related costs associated with climate-sensitive events highlight the importance of actions to mitigate climate change and adapt to its unavoidable impacts. © 2019.

Both the electric vehicle routing model and the traditional fuel vehicle routing model are constructed aiming at minimizing the total costs, which includes the fixed costs of vehicles, depreciation costs, penalty costs for violating customer time window, energy costs and carbon trading costs. Then a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed to address these two models, the advantages of greedy algorithm and random full permutation are combined to set the initial population, at the same time, the crossover operation is improved to retain the excellent gene fragments effectively and the hill climbing algorithm is embedded to enhance the local search ability of HGA. Furthermore, a case data is used with HGA to carry out computational experiments in these two models and the results indicate that first using electric vehicles for distribution can indeed reduce the carbon emissions, but results in a low customer satisfaction compared with using fuel vehicles. Besides, the battery capacity and charge rate have a great influence on total costs of using electric vehicles. Second, carbon price plays an important role in the transformation of logistics companies. As the carbon price changes, the total costs, carbon trading costs, and carbon emissions of using electric vehicles and fuel vehicles are affected accordingly, yet the trends are different. The changes of carbon quota have nothing to do with the distribution scheme and companies’ transformation but influence the total costs of using electric and fuel vehicles for distribution, and the trends are the same.

It has become a global consensus to reduce the amount of fossil fuel power consumption and promote the development of renewable energy. At the same time, renewable energy is rapidly developing, which is gradually meeting more and more energy needs. Electricity is one of the most important ways to make largescale use of renewable energy. However, because of the intermittent and volatility of renewable energy, regardless of the high proportion of wind power or solar power generation, it will be sure to cause an impact on the operation of the power system. In this paper, a global renewable energy acceptance capacity prediction model has been proposed. And the empirically studies were analyzed to provide a basis for global energy conservation and emission reduction. In this paper, the development of power in typical regions of the world was summarized, and artificial bee colony algorithm integrated with production simulation was introduced to build a renewable energy acceptance capacity model based on the principle of maximizing the acceptance of renewable energy while maintaining stable operation of the grid. The ability to accept regional renewable energy generation in 2030 was also assessed. © 2019 IEEE.","artificial bee colony algorithm; production simulation; renewable energy acceptance capacity","Emission control; Optimization; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind power; Artificial bee colony algorithms; Capacity modeling; Capacity prediction; Global economies; Production simulation; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Use of renewable energies; Fossil fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083079281

Using data from 30 provinces in China, this paper adopted the Tapio decoupling index to examine the relationship between the development of the transport sector and its CO2 emissions from provincial perspective. Additionally, we employed the logarithmic mean divisia index method to explore the effect of several factors on the state of decoupling. The results showed that the under-developed provinces were more likely to present a weak decoupling state than the developed and coastal provinces. Income level was the major influential factor limiting the development of decoupling in the transport sector. The population scale had a very small negative role in the development of decoupling. Moreover, the effects of CO2 emissions efficiency, transport intensity and industry structure varied across provinces. By offering a provincial perspective on decoupling states and its driving factors, this study can provide a reference for governments in proposing carbon-reduction policies and promoting low carbon development of the transport sector. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Decoupling state; Influencing factor; LMDI; Transport sector","Carbon; Emission control; Energy utilization; CO2 emissions; Decoupling state; Influencing factor; LMDI; Transport sectors; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy use; traffic emission; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069727162

In this study, the effect of this awareness on container transport in Northeast China is used as an empirical case study. Firstly, we propose that the freight demand index, calculated by the entropy weight TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution) method, reflects the degree of container demand in destination cities. Then, we describe five scenarios against the background of China's container development plan and use them to evaluate the cost and carbon emissions of container rerouting. The overall objective of the study is to assess the effects of changes in port selection on the formation of new routes and multimodal transport. The results show that carbon taxes do not significantly affect multimodal transport networks, and the impact of loading and unloading costs on the total cost is far greater than that of corresponding carbon emissions. Despite the railway transportation capacity of Dalian Port, the results show that Yingkou Port and Dandong Port will expand by 227.8% and 191.4% over 2017, respectively. Therefore, Liaoning Port Group needs to reposition its different ports. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon reduction strategies; Container transport; Multimodal transportation; Port selection","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; container ship; entropy; operations technology; pollution tax; port operation; railway transport; China; Dalian; Liaoning; Yingkou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072642971

P#1 used anthracite coal and was equipped with in-furnace desulfurization (IFD) and electrostatic precipitator (ESP). P#2 co-burned gangue and coal slime and was equipped with selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), ESP, fabric filter (FF) and limestone gypsum wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD). Flue gas samples from the inlets and outlets of air pollution control devices (APCDs) in the two plants were analyzed using the Ontario Hydro Method (OHM). Solid samples including feed coal, limestone, bottom ash, fly ash and gypsum were also collected and analyzed. Hg removal efficiency by the APCDs and Hg emission factors (MEFs) were estimated. Total Hg (THg) in the flue gas at the inlet of ESP are 32.3 µg·m−3 and 15.3 µg·m−3 for P#1 and P#2, respectively, both dominated (95.11–99.26%) by the particulate form (Hgp). THg decreased significantly to 0.19–0.24 µg·m−3 at the final APCDs outlets of these two power plants, yielding an overall Hg removal efficiency of 98.53–99.41% for THg. Mass balance analysis indicated that &gt;97% of Hg in coals ended up in captured fly ash. MEFs of the two tested power plants are relatively lower than the values typically found in CFB and pulverized coal (PC) utility boiler power plants.

In this paper, we measured the industrialization levels of the 31 regions in China from 2003 to 2017 as a sum of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), urban population (% of total), tertiary vs. secondary industry output ratio, non-agricultural output value (% of GDP), non-agricultural employment proportion, and the proportion of added value of manufacturing in the total added value of commodity. We measured air quality as a sum of annual SO2, NO2 and PM10 concentrations. In general, the industrialization level continuously increased while air pollution was reduced in spite of some fluctuations in China. Our results show air pollution presented N-shape relations with the industrialization level in China in the periods from 2003 to 2008, 2009 to 2013, and 2014 to 2017. Air pollution increases as the industrialization occurs but later deceases as the industrialization level improves. However, air pollution rebounds as the industrialization moves further but this rebound became weaker in recent years. With the association rule mining, we identified ranges of the six indicators for industrialization associated with good and poor air quality, respectively. Using industrialization indicators associated with poor air quality as references, we pointed out differentiated strategies for regions to coordinate the industrialization and air quality protection. © 2019","Air quality; Association rule; Differentiated management; Industrialization level; N-curve","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); industrial emission; industrialization; manufacturing; urban population; air pollution; air quality; Article; China; employment; gross national product; human; industrialization; mining; reference value; urban population; air pollutant; air pollution; industrialization; particulate matter; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Industrial Development; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067239030

Norfloxacin (NOR) residues in rhizosphere sediments, plant roots, branches, and leaves of two dominant mangrove communities, Rhizophora stylosa and Avicennia marina, the correlation between physical properties of rhizosphere deposition and residual NOR in sediments, and NOR accumulation in the root system were analyzed. Significant differences were noted in NOR residues in rhizosphere sediments of R. stylosa and A. marina, with higher NOR concentrations than those in other wetland sediments locally and abroad. NOR accumulation in R. stylosa was higher in the branches than in the roots and was also significantly higher than that in A. marina. Thus, both species could accumulate NOR from the environment with R. stylosa showing a stronger potential to purify the environment.

Soil microbial diversity has been reported to drive multiple functions simultaneously (multifunctionality) in drylands and temperate ecosystems, however, the role and importance of bacterial and fungal diversity in driving multiple soil functions in boreal forest ecosystems remains poorly understood. We collected soils from 58 plots across upland and lowland (swamp) habitats in a boreal forest ecosystem to evaluate the linkages between fungal/bacterial diversity and multiple soil functions. Fungal and bacterial diversity were determined using 18S rDNA and 16S rDNA amplicons sequencing, and functions related to nutrient cycling (dissolved inorganic and organic nitrogen and carbon, nitrification) and climate regulation (CO2 and N2O emissions) were measured. The results showed that fungal but not bacterial richness was positively related to soil multifunctionality. We further used structural equation modelling to identify the effects of fungal and bacterial communities, and other environmental variables (moisture, pH, soil organic carbon and habitat types) on multifunctionality. Our model predicted 65.0% of the variation in soil multifunctionality, and confirmed that along with moisture and habitats, fungal richness and community composition were significantly and positively associated with multifunctionality. Finally, we identified specific fungal genera strongly associated with soil multifunctionality, and saprotrophic fungi were especially important for maintaining multiple soil functions. Our results suggest that potential losses in fungal diversity could result in reductions in soil functions particularly linked to nutrient cycling and climate regulation in boreal forests. © 2019","Boreal forest; Functional group; Fungal community composition; Fungal diversity; Multifunctionality; Saprotrophic fungi","Ecosystems; Forestry; Functional groups; Moisture; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Soils; Boreal forests; Fungal community compositions; Fungal diversity; Multifunctionality; Saprotrophic fungi; Fungi; boreal forest; forest ecosystem; forest soil; fungus; genetic analysis; nutrient cycling; organic nitrogen; saprotrophy; soil carbon; soil organic matter; species richness; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068151821

In this work, we combined the in situ measurements of the chemical components of submicron particles (PM1) in Beijing during the winters of 2014 and 2017 and a regional chemical transport model to investigate the impact of clean air actions on aerosol chemistry and quantify the relative contributions of anthropogenic emissions, meteorological conditions, and regional transport to the changes in aerosol chemical composition from 2014 to 2017. We found that the average PM1 concentration in winter in Beijing decreased by 49.5 % from 2014 to 2017 (from 66.2 to 33.4 μg m-3). Sulfate exhibited a much larger decline than nitrate and ammonium, which led to a rapid transition from sulfate-driven to nitrate-driven aerosol pollution during the wintertime. Organic aerosol (OA), especially coal combustion OA, and black carbon also showed large decreasing rates, indicating the effective emission control of coal combustion and biomass burning. The decreased sulfate contribution and increased nitrate fraction were highly consistent with the much faster emission reductions in sulfur dioxide (SO2) due to phasing out coal in Beijing compared to reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions estimated by bottomup inventory. The chemical transport model simulations with these emission estimates reproduced the relative changes in aerosol composition and suggested that the reduced emissions in Beijing and its surrounding regions played a dominant role. The variations in meteorological conditions and regional transport contributed much less to the changes in aerosol concentration and its chemical composition during 2014-2017 compared to the decreasing emissions. Finally, we speculated that changes in precursor emissions possibly altered the aerosol formation mechanisms based on ambient observations. The observed explosive growth of sulfate at a relative humidity (RH) greater than 50 % in 2014 was delayed to a higher RH of 70 % in 2017, which was likely caused by the suppressed sulfate formation through heterogeneous reactions due to the decrease in SO2 emissions. Thermodynamic simulations showed that the decreased sulfate and nitrate concentrations have lowered the aerosol water content, particle acidity, and ammonium particle fraction. The results in this study demonstrate the response of aerosol chemistry to the stringent clean air actions and identify that the anthropogenic emission reductions are a major driver, which could help to further guide air pollution control strategies in China. © 2019 Author(s).",,"aerosol; aerosol composition; air quality; atmospheric transport; concentration (composition); particulate matter; seasonal variation; source apportionment; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072262940

This paper presents the current development status and GHG (Greenhouse Gas) mitigation effect of the straw based biomass power plants in Anhui Province. Total biomass production in 2016 was calculated as 41.84 million tons. Although there is huge biomass potential in AHP, the distribution is heterogeneous with a gradually decreasing trend from north to south. Furthermore, the installed capacity of power generation is also unmatched with the biomass resources. Based on a calculation made in 2016, approximately 3.44 million tons of CO2-eq were mitigated from the biomass power plants in AHP. The large-scale development of biomass power plants remains a challenge for the future, especially in areas of AHP with a low biomass density. © 2019 by the authors.","Anhui; Biomass resource; GHG emission mitigation; Power plant",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072210297

Focusing on air quality in a heavily polluted city (Weifang Cty), this study aims to investigate spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of air pollution and identify the influence of weather factors on primary pollutants in Weifang over a long period from 2014–2018. The results indicate the annual Air quality Index (AQI) in Weifang has decreased since 2014 but is still far from the standard for excellent air quality. The primary pollutants are O3 (Ozone), PM10 (Particles with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 µm), and PM2.5 (Particles with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 µm); the annual concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 show a significant reduction but that of O3 is basically unchanged. Seasonally, PM10 and PM2.5 show a U-shaped pattern, while O3 exhibits inverted U-shaped variations, and different pollutants also present different characteristics daily. Spatially, O3 exhibits a high level in the central region and a low level in the rural areas, while PM10 and PM2.5 are high in the northwest and low in the southeast. Additionally, the concentration of pollutants is greatly affected by meteorological factors, with PM2.5 being negatively correlated with temperature and wind speed, while O3 is positively correlated with the temperature. This research investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of the air pollution and provided important policy advice based on the findings, which can be used to mitigate air pollution. © 2019 by the authors.

Reductions of energy demand have an important role to play in a sustainable energy transition. Here we explore the extent to which the emergence of low energy consuming practices, encompassing new behaviors and the adoption of more efficient technologies, could contribute to lowering energy demand and thereby to reducing CO2 emissions. To this end, we design three detailed energy consumption profiles which could be adopted by individuals in current and future wealthy regions. To what extent does the setting of air conditioners to higher temperatures or the widespread use of efficient showerheads reduce the aggregate energy demand? We investigate the potential of new practices at the global level for 2050 and 2100. The adoption of new, energy saving practices could reduce global energy demand from buildings by up to 47% in 2050 and 61% in 2100 compared to a scenario following current trends. This strong reduction is primarily accounted for by changes in hot water usage, insulation of buildings and consumer choices in air conditioners and heat pumps. New behaviors and efficient technologies could make a significant long-term contribution to reducing buildings' energy demand, and thus facilitate the achieval of stringent climate change mitigation targets while limiting the adverse sustainability impacts from the energy supply system. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Behavioral changes; Buildings' energy demand; Energy consumption; Lifestyle changes; Practices","Air conditioning; Buildings; Consumer behavior; Domestic appliances; Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy utilization; Global warming; Behavioral changes; Climate change mitigation; Energy demands; Energy supply system; Global energy demand; Lifestyle changes; Practices; Sustainability impacts; Energy efficiency; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; consumption behavior; emission control; energy planning; energy use; lifestyle; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067043982

We isolated the effects of white-tailed deer on the regeneration of ten ecologically and commercially important tree species across the state of New York by fitting forest regeneration models with variables representing fine-scale plant competition, stand-scale seed dispersal, and region-wide patterns of climate, land-use, and deer abundance. Deer effects were not consistent across species or space. Increasing deer abundance was associated with declining seedling abundance for six species (Acer rubrum, Picea rubens, Pinus strobus, Tsuga canadensis, Prunus serotina, and Abies balsamea), and nonlinear changes (peaking at intermediate deer abundance) for four species (Acer saccharum, Betula alleghaniensis, Fagus grandifolia, Fraxinus americana). Models further indicated: (1) in many areas, meaningful increases in tree seedling abundance may not be achievable by reducing deer abundance alone; (2) in some areas, modest reductions in deer abundance may improve forest regeneration—these would be of high deer management priority; and (3) in some areas, the magnitude of deer population reductions required to achieve meaningful improvement in forest regeneration may be too large to be practical. Predicting forest regeneration across heterogeneous landscapes is complex, and isolating the effects of deer requires greater understanding of multiple potentially limiting and interacting factors (e.g., land-use, climate, forest characteristics). Our approach, based on readily available spatial data, may help prioritize areas, define management goals, and lay a foundation for adaptive management of deer to improve forest regeneration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Forest fragmentation; Forest regeneration; Herbivory; Land-use; Natural regeneration; White-tailed deer","Climate models; Land use; Plants (botany); Seed; Forest fragmentations; Forest regeneration; Herbivory; Natural regeneration; White-tailed deer; Reforestation; abundance; browsing; deer; fragmentation; herbivory; land use; regeneration; seed dispersal; Abies; Land Use; Management; Models; Natural Reforestation; Patterns; Trees; New York [United States]; United States; Abies balsamea; Acer rubrum; Acer saccharum; Betula alleghaniensis; Cervidae; Fagus grandifolia; Fraxinus americana; Odocoileus virginianus; Picea rubens; Pinus strobus; Prunus serotina; Tsuga canadensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067823305

Radiocarbon data for methane and dissolved inorganic/organic carbon indicate that the dominant sources of carbon in the aquifer are marine organic matter dating from both the Champlain Sea incursion (10–12 ka BP) and ancient terrestrial organic matter from an Early-Wisconsinian interstadial period. The prevalence of ancient organic matter sources is particularly evident in the methane pool. During early stages of methanogenesis, CO2 derived from the preferential decomposition of labile marine organic matter is the dominant substrate for methanogenesis, whereas a substrate transition to acetate derived from the fermentation of refractory ancient terrestrial organic matter is observed during later stages of methanogenesis.

However, there is a significant coking problem during the operation of the dry reforming reactor. Because methane dry reforming is a strong endothermic reaction, the temperature of the reactor drops near the reactor inlet and causes coke formation. To solve this problem, it is important to ensure that the reaction takes place in a temperature range where coke production is minimized. In this study, we proposed a design method that can maintain the reaction temperature in the region where the coke is rarely generated using new configurations of packed catalysts. It was experimentally confirmed that a new catalyst configuration method could be used to obtain the desired temperature profile in the reactor to inhibit coke formation. The design method also optimizes the reactor by solving the optimization problem, which minimizes the reactor length for a given reaction conversion using the fuel flow rate, catalyst density, and output temperature by layer as optimization variables. The proposed design method was shown to be effective in inhibiting coking experimentally and numerically. The same production rate was achieved with a much smaller amount of catalysts compared with a typical dry reformer. The proposed processes were also shown to maintain stable operation for large disturbances in the feed flow rate. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalysts; Design; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Endothermic reactions; Greenhouse gas reductions; Methane dry reforming; Optimization problems; Optimization variables; Reaction conversion; Reaction temperature; Temperature profiles; Coke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072649327

Air pollution can induce oxidative stress. Understanding the relationship between TL, asthma, and air pollution is important for identifying risk factors contributing to unhealthy aging in children. Objectives: We sought to investigate associations between exposures to ambient air pollutants and TL in African American children and adolescents and to examine whether African ancestry, asthma status, and steroid medication use alter the association. Methods: Linear regression was used to examine associations between absolute telomere length (aTL) and estimated annual average residential ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) exposures in a cross-sectional analysis of 1072 children in an existing asthma case-control study. African ancestry, asthma status, and use of steroid medications were examined as effect modifiers. Results: Participants' aTLs were measured by using quantitative PCR. A 1-ppb and 1 μg/m3 increase in annual average exposure to O3 and PM2.5 were associated with a decrease in aTL of 37.1 kilo-base pair (kb; 95% CI, −66.7 to −7.4 kb) and 57.1 kb (95% CI, −118.1 to 3.9 kb), respectively. African ancestry and asthma were not effect modifiers; however, exposure to steroid medications modified the relationships between TL and pollutants. Past-year exposure to O3 and PM2.5 was associated with shorter TLs in patients without steroid use. Conclusion: Exposure to air pollution was associated with shorter TLs in nonasthmatic children and adolescents. This was not the case for asthmatic children as a group, but those receiving steroid medication had less shortening than those not using steroids. Reduced exposure to air pollution in childhood might help to preserve TL. © 2019 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","asthma; children; fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less; minority; Ozone; telomeres","corticosteroid; ozone; steroid; adolescent; African American; air pollutant; air pollution; ambient air; ancestry group; Article; asthma; asthmatic state; case control study; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; human; juvenile; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; particle size; particulate matter; polymerase chain reaction; population exposure; priority journal; quantitative analysis; risk factor; steroid therapy; telomere length; adult; asthma; environmental exposure; ethnology; telomere; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; African Americans; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asthma; Child; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Steroids; Telomere; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069719898

The increase in emissions from road traffic renders air quality management unsuccessful, in spite of the efforts of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), operating under the Clean Air Act, which does not regulate land use. As an alternative to urban sprawl, the US-EPA has initiated smart growth strategies based on compact development. In this study, the impacts of metropolitan-level urban form, as a measure of urban compactness/sprawl, was explored with respect to air quality in terms of NOx and PM2.5 emissions on the road and NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations in US metropolitan areas. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-level regression models that control for metropolitan-level socioeconomic and local-level geographic covariates were established. The results showed that high land use mixing is one of the compactness/sprawl factors (i.e., low sprawl) that reduces per-person NOx and PM2.5 emissions on the road. While metropolitan-level urban form (i.e. high compactness) had a negative effect on PM2.5 concentrations, local environmental conditions, such as local ambient roads and emissions facilities, had greater impacts on NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations than the urban form. Based on the findings in this study, urban planners and decision makers need to establish policies and practices at two scales when planning urban development: (1) the reduction of emissions from road traffic by managing metropolitan-level urban form and (2) the reduction of emissions concentrations through managing local emissions sources near populated areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrations; Nitrogen dioxide; Particulate matter; Road emissions; Urban form; Urban sprawl","nitric oxide; air quality; concentration (composition); metropolitan area; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; pollutant source; road; road traffic; traffic emission; urban development; urban growth; urban pollution; urban region; urban sprawl; air quality; Article; comparative study; concentration (parameter); environmental policy; exhaust gas; geography; highway; land use; motor vehicle; particulate matter; socioeconomics; United States; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; government; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067249306

Urban form was quantified using Smart Growth America (SGA) sprawl indexes with density, land use mixing, centeredness, and street connectivity. NOx emissions from road traffic were derived from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). Through modeling NO2 concentrations using land use regression (LUR), with satellite-based estimates and kriging, this study measured NO2 concentrations within MAs in the US The study results showed that higher levels of urban form scores (i.e., higher compactness) and land use mixing were associated with lower per-person NOx emissions from road traffic. In addition, higher levels of centeredness were associated with lower NO2 concentrations, but the effect was moderate. On the other hand, regional rainfall and solar insolation had more significant associations with NO2 concentrations than metropolitan urban form. Meanwhile, localized emissions sources had significant associations with local-level NO2 concentrations. This study provides additional evidence on the relationship between urban form and air quality in the US MAs. The study suggests that high compactness-oriented development and the reduction of localized emission sources may be effective in reducing NOx emissions from road traffic and local NO2 concentrations, respectively. However, future studies need to explore the impact of urban form at both the MA and local levels on NO2 concentrations and develop a more accurate national NO2 concentration prediction model. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Metropolitan areas; NO2 concentrations; NOx emissions from road traffic; Smart growth; Urban form","Air quality; Land use; Mixing; Nitrogen oxides; Roads and streets; Concentration prediction; Land use regression; Metropolitan area; National emissions inventories; Road traffic; Smart growth; Street connectivity; Urban form; Urban growth; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); metropolitan area; nitrogen dioxide; traffic emission; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069056254

Here, the performance of several bioremediation tools such as emulsifiers, multi-enzyme liquid (MEL), microbes, and rice-straw was evaluated by a 90-days semi-field experiment, particularly targeting recovery of benthic community. Temporal efficiency in the removal of sedimentary total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), reduction of residual toxicity, and recovery of bacterial diversity, microalgal growth, and benthic production was comprehensively determined. Concentrations of TPH and amphipod mortality for all treatments rapidly decreased within the first 10 days. In addition, the density of bacteria and microphytobenthos generally increased over time for all treatments, indicating recovery in the benthic community health. However, the recovery of some nitrifying bacteria, such as the class Nitrospinia (which are sensitive to oil components) remained incomplete (13–56%) during 90 days. Combination of microbe treatments showed rapid and effective for recovering the benthic community, but after 90 days, all treatments showed high recovery efficiency. Of consideration, the “no action” treatment showed a similar level of recovery to those of microbe and MEL treatments, indicating that the natural recovery process could prevail in certain situations. “Among various bioremediation techniques tested, the microbes was rapid and effective in restoring benthic community health.” © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Benthic community; Oil spill; PAH-Degrading bacteria; PAH-Vulnerable bacteria; Restoration; Semi-field experiment","Bacteria; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Efficiency; Health; Image reconstruction; Nitrification; Oil spills; Benthic communities; Comparative evaluations; Field experiment; Nitrifying bacteria; Oil-contaminated sediments; Pah-degrading bacteria; Recovery efficiency; Total petroleum hydrocarbons; Recovery; petroleum derivative; emulsifying agent; hydrocarbon; petroleum; benthos; bioremediation; comparative study; microbial activity; microbial community; oil pollution; oil spill; sediment pollution; algal growth; Article; benthic fauna; bioremediation; concentration (parameter); controlled study; genome analysis; metagenomics; microbial community; nitrifying bacterium; nonhuman; oil spill; pollution monitoring; residue analysis; sediment; species diversity; bacterium; comparative study; evaluation study; metabolism; microbiology; oil spill; public health; sediment; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Emulsifying Agents; Geologic Sediments; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum; Petroleum Pollution; Public Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066155084

We develop an analytical model and a numerical model applied to the European Union electricity market in which renewable energy subsidies are justified only by CO2 abatement. We confirm that in this context, when uncertainty is small, renewable energy subsidies are not welfare-improving, but we show that when uncertainty is large enough, these subsidies increase expected welfare because they provide CO2 abatement even in the case of over-allocation, i.e. when the cap is higher than the emissions which would have occurred without the ETS. The source of uncertainty is important when comparing the various types of renewable energy subsidies. Under uncertainty over electricity demand, renewable energy costs or gas prices, a feed-in tariff brings higher expected welfare than a feed-in premium because it provides a higher subsidy when it is actually needed i.e. when the electricity price is low. Under uncertainty over coal prices, the opposite result holds true. Key policy insights Due to the possibility of over-allocation in an ETS, subsidies to renewable energies can increase expected welfare, even when climate change mitigation is the only benefit from renewables taken into account. In most cases studied, a feed-in tariff brings a higher expected welfare than a feed-in premium. The European Commission guidelines on State aid for energy, which incentivize member States to replace feed-in tariffs by feed-in premiums, should be reconsidered based on these results. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ETS; feed-in premium; feed-in tariff; policy interaction; renewable energy; uncertainty; uncertainty","alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; subsidy system; tariff structure; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067654091

To effectively do so, quantified overviews of pollutant emissions at national levels and with some granularity in their sources, are required. However, current monitoring efforts are often scattered and a quantitative and comprehensive inventory of toxic emissions in Europe is lacking. Toxic pollutants stem from a large variety of emission sources from industry, agriculture, households, etc. and the difficulty to cover all of them is manifest in public databases and official reports, where data gaps across countries and years exist for several substances. Here, we propose a methodology to tackle this problem and build comprehensive and harmonized national inventories of toxic pollutants. Using public databases, official reports, scientific literature and developing extrapolation techniques specific to each emission source, we derived harmonized annual inventories of toxic pollutants in all EU Member States over the years 2000–2014. They present an unprecedented coverage of 805, 572, and 468 substances emitted to air, water and soil, respectively. Although the resulting dataset shows a relatively good agreement with previous inventories of narrower scopes, uncertainties can be identified for specific emission sources and in the development of extrapolation techniques, thus calling for further research in these areas. Such efforts should also explore adaptation of the methodology to derive comprehensive inventories for countries outside EU, where data is scarcer. Nonetheless, the developed national inventories can provide a starting point for territorial chemical footprints of toxic pollutants and could be coupled with environmental impact assessment for gauging the damages to ecosystems and human health from toxic pollutants emitted in Europe. This can ultimately support policy-makers in their pollutants prioritisation and benchmarking across substances and countries towards improved toxic emission reduction policies. © 2019 The Authors","Environmental impact assessment; Nations chemical footprint; Pollutant release; Pollution monitoring; Sustainability; Toxicity","Agricultural robots; Damage detection; Emission control; Environmental impact assessments; Extrapolation; Molecular physics; Toxicity; Chemical pollution; Extrapolation techniques; International policies; National emission inventories; Nations chemical footprint; Pollutant release; Pollution monitoring; Scientific literature; Sustainable development; pesticide; emission inventory; environmental impact assessment; European Union; pollutant; pollution control; pollution monitoring; sustainability; toxic substance; toxicity; agricultural waste; air analysis; air pollution; Article; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; Europe; health hazard; industrial waste; pollution monitoring; priority journal; quality control; residential area; sewage; soil analysis; soil pollution; waste site; water analysis; water pollution; dangerous goods; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; factual database; human; legislation and jurisprudence; pollutant; pollution; procedures; public health; Europe; Databases, Factual; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Environmental Pollution; Europe; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Public Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067798734

Because of their high flexibility that endows them with pressure-, heat- and acid-resistance, IDPs are valuable metabolic regulators that help algae to cope with extreme conditions of pH, temperature, pressure and light. They have, however, been overlooked in these organisms. In this review, we present some well-known algal IDPs, including the conditionally disordered CP12, a protein involved in the regulation of CO2 assimilation, as probably the best known example, whose disorder content is strongly dependent on the redox conditions, and the essential pyrenoid component 1 that serves as a scaffold for ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. We also describe how some enzymes are regulated by protein regions, called intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), such as ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase, the A2B2 form of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the adenylate kinase. Several molecular chaperones, which are crucial for cell proteostasis, also display significant disorder propensities such as the algal heat shock proteins HSP33, HSP70 and HSP90. This review confirms the wide distribution of IDPs in algae but highlights that further studies are needed to uncover their full role in orchestrating algal metabolism. © 2019","Calvin cycle; Chaperone; CP12; EPYC; Intrinsically disordered protein; RuBisCO","adk3 protein; carbon dioxide; chaperone; essential pyrenoid component 1; gapdh b protein; protein; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; unclassified drug; algal protein; chaperone; intrinsically disordered protein; alga; carbon dioxide fixation; carboxy terminal sequence; disorders of amino acid and protein metabolism; metabolism; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phylogeny; plant; priority journal; protein function; protein structure; regulatory mechanism; Review; chemistry; green alga; microalga; photosynthesis; physiology; Algal Proteins; Chlorophyta; Intrinsically Disordered Proteins; Microalgae; Molecular Chaperones; Photosynthesis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070519122

This study examines the stratigraphic position and distribution of microbial fabric in the Lower Furongian Changshan Formation exposed in Kouquan section of Datong City in the North China Platform. The formation is comprised of the first third-order carbonate depositional sequence of the drowning unconformity-type in Furongian. A variation tendency of sedimentary facies characterized by a generally shallowing upward succession can be noticed across the formation, ranging from the calcareous mudstone and shale of shelf facies at the bottom to massive micrites in the middle, and to thick-bedded oolitic grainstone of shallow-ramp facies in the top part. Inside a bed of microbial carbonate composed of massive micrites in the upper part of the formation, developed the dense undifferentiated microbial boundstones as a result of forced regression in response to the third-order relative sea-level falling, which can be grouped into leiolitic bioherms. A variety of well-preserved calcified cyanobacteria fossils recognizable as Epiphyton, Girvanella, and Renalcis developed inside the leiolite. These aerobic calcified microorganisms contribute to the calcification of mucilaginous sheaths by uptake of CO2 and/or HCO3 − during photo-assimilated photosynthesis and participate in the first episode of cyanobacteria calcification event in Phanerozoic. The current macroscopic and microscopic analyses provide significant implications for the future understanding of the origin of leiolitic bioherm and their paleodepositional environment in the North China Platform. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Cambrian; Changshan Formation; Cyanobacteria; Leiolitic bioherm; North China Platform","bioherm; calcification; Cambrian; cyanobacterium; depositional environment; fossil; microbialite; sequence stratigraphy; spatial distribution; China; North China Block; Cyanobacteria; Girvanella; Renalcis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054588918

The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends no more than 6–9 teaspoons/capita/day, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends 200 calories/capita/day of caloric sweetener consumption. Both recommendations are well below the reported 2016 sweetener consumption levels. We quantify the input tax rates needed to reduce the current excess sweetener consumption level to the AHA and FDA recommended standards. We calculate the joint tax in the United States on two major sweeteners, sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), to be 31 and 24 cents per pound, respectively, based on the AHA standard, and 19 and 17 cents per pound, respectively, using the FDA standard. These taxes would be roughly the magnitude of the existing sugar and HFCS prices. In both cases, the tax incidence on producers is much smaller than on consumers. Our focus is very different from past studies in that it deals with the effect of taxes on inputs to meet the recommended target rather than a selective tax (sugar-sweetened beverage tax).

These mechanisms also help to explain different responses on climate policy across the left-right spectrum. Competition between mainstream parties is particularly powerful, but can constrain as much as it enables ‘greener’ climate policy preferences.

It has been suggested that methanogens may have flourished in the anoxic and sulfate-poor environments of the Precambrian ocean, generating large amounts of methane that would have accumulated in the atmosphere and warmed the early Earth. However, modern ferruginous and sulfate-poor environments such as Lake Matano are not very efficient at generating methane, converting only about 5% of organic carbon to CH4 despite the lack of alternative remineralization pathways. We apply this restriction to a simple model of marine carbon cycling in order to generate new estimates of methane concentrations in the Precambrian atmosphere. Our results suggest that, if the ancient biosphere were similarly inefficient, atmospheric methane concentrations did not exceed 1 ppm, or about twice the pre-industrial value, at any time during the Proterozoic. Following the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, the maximum methane concentration in the Archean atmosphere was order 100 ppm, but no more than 1 ppm if steady state oxygen concentrations were greater than 10−8 present atmospheric levels. Substantially larger methane concentrations are only possible before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. © 2019","Archean; methane; Proterozoic","Atmospheric chemistry; Biology; Earth atmosphere; Methanation; Organic carbon; Photosynthesis; Submarine geology; Sulfur compounds; Archean; Atmospheric methanes; Methane concentrations; Methane production; Oxygen concentrations; Oxygenic photosynthesis; Precambrian atmospheres; Proterozoic; Methane; anoxic conditions; Archean; concentration (composition); marine sediment; methane; photosynthesis; Precambrian; Proterozoic; Greater Sunda Islands; Lake Matano; Malili Lakes; South Sulawesi; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068166804

Polish energy sector is currently based on inefficient usage of coal and must be transformed according to the requirements of EU energy and climate policy. A policy framework for climate and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030 established the target of 27% of share of RES in energy consumption. With the continuing increase in the use of RES, it is likely that more and more generation will have to be curtailed to maintain the stability of the power system which was not originally designed to integrate renewable generation. In this context, the conversion of renewable electricity to heat in connection with its storage in district heating systems, known as Power-to-Heat (PtH) can be considered as a viable option in increasing the share of RES and facilitating the stability of the power system. In this paper an attempt is made to estimate the potential of PtH technology for Poland up to 2030, including the high RES share scenario for the energy mix development. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"District heating; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Heating equipment; Platinum compounds; Renewable energy resources; District heating system; Energy and climate policies; European union; Heat technology; Policy framework; Renewable electricity; Renewable energy source; Renewable generation; System stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072798983

Transport of CO2 in pipelines typically involves high pressures and low temperatures favourable for hydrate formation. Aquifer storage of CO2 also frequently involves regions of the storage sediments which are inside CO2 hydrate formation. CO2 hydrate can even be an active phase in CO2 separation technology. Hydrate formation, like any other phase transition, has two physically well-defined stages. The initial nucleation is an unstable phase in which the thermodynamic benefit of the phase transition competes with the thermodynamic penalty of pushing away the existing phases. The latter term depends on size as well as shape of the growing hydrate nuclei. The transition from nucleation over to stable growth is therefore generally dependent on the geometrical dimension of the crystal, which can range from one for a spherical core and upwards to complex crystal morphologies. A third stage which is not uniquely defined physically is the so-called induction time. This is the stage at which the hydrate growth is massive and visible by various detection methods like pressure change, laser detection of crystals or other imaging techniques. Frequently, the induction time is misinterpreted as nucleation time. Nucleation is a nano-scale process, but several situations of hydrate formation leads to changes in access to hydrate building blocks. Formation of a hydrate film on the interface between water and a hydrate former phase will substantially delay mass transport for further growth. The slow, mass transport limited, growth towards detectable hydrate is therefore frequently misinterpreted as absence of hydrate. Yet another set of misunderstandings arise from the fact that hydrates in industry and nature can never approach equilibrium. Some of these are well known for simple systems, but there are also some relevant phases that are rarely accounted for, for a deeper understanding of the hydrate. Finally, there are frequently misconceptions that only one type of hydrate is formed always. In this work we utilize classical thermodynamics with residual thermodynamics description for all phases, including hydrate, to analyse various routes to hydrate formation between CO2 and water. We utilize classical nucleation theory for simplified hydrate geometries in order to illustrate the range of likely hydrate nucleation times as well as ranges of different hydrate that can form. Hydrate forming homogeneously from dissolved CO2 in water can form a range of different hydrates since the composition will change depending on the concentration of CO2 in water. Hydrate nucleation times are very fast and in the nanoseconds range. Times for onset of massive growth in systems without stirring or other hydrodynamic forces that can break hydrate films can be very long due to slow transport through initial hydrate films. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","A1. heterogeneous; A1.

It is shown that silicon and manganese promote the leveling of cyclic fracture toughness of steels in different zones of the wheel rim and the decrease in the high-temperature (above 500°С) plasticity (elongation), which reduces the susceptibility of steel to the formation of slid flats on the rolling surface of the wheel.

Integrated coal gasification solid oxide fuel cell hybrid power plants have the potential to achieve high power plant efficiencies and enable opportunities for the efficient capture of CO2. The investigation of such power plants is the subject of this publication. The developed systems are based on conventional integrated coal gasification combined cycle technology and integrated with solid oxide fuel cells preceding the combined cycle process. The state of development of the selected solid oxide fuel cell technology is similar to that of integrated coal gasification combined cycles. Along with the base case, several other concepts with and without CO2 capture are developed using various process technologies. Fundamental system and sensitivity analyses are performed using simplified sub-processes to obtain general statements and trends as well as to calculate optimal boundary conditions for the overall systems. The simulations show that the preparation of process gas using a water gas shift reactor before entering the solid oxide fuel cells is beneficial for the overall efficiency.

Design A cost-effectiveness analysis is undertaken from a healthcare perspective. Investment costs over a 50-year life cycle are offset by averted healthcare costs and compared with estimated long-term impacts on morbidity, quantified in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The results are re-calculated under different assumptions to model the effects of uncertainty. Setting The Municipality of Stockholm (population 2.27 million) committed funds for bicycle path infrastructure with the aim of achieving a 15% increase in the number of bicycle commuters by 2030. This work is based on a previously constructed scenario, in which individual registry data on home and work address and a transport model allocation to different modes of transport identified 111 487 individuals with the physical capacity to bicycle to work within 30 min but that currently drive a car to work. Results Morbidity impacts and healthcare costs attributed to increased physical activity, change in air pollution exposure and accident risk are quantified under the scenario. The largest reduction in healthcare costs is attributed to increased physical activity and the second largest to reduced air pollution exposure among the population of Greater Stockholm. The expected net benefit from the investment is 8.7% of the 2017 Stockholm County healthcare budget, and 3.7% after discounting. The economic evaluation estimates that the intervention is cost-effective and each DALY averted gives a surplus of €9933. The results remained robust under varied assumptions pertaining to reduced numbers of additional bicycle commuters. Conclusion Investing in urban infrastructure to increase bicycling as active transport is cost-effective from a healthcare sector perspective. © 2019 Author(s).","commuting; DALY; health economic evaluation; health impacts; transport mode shift","air pollution; Article; asthma; breast cancer; cerebrovascular accident; colon cancer; cost effectiveness analysis; cycling; dementia; disability-adjusted life year; economic evaluation; health care cost; heart failure; heart infarction; human; investment; lung cancer; morbidity; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physical activity; physical capacity; Sweden; traffic and transport; air pollution; city; cost benefit analysis; health behavior; procedures; risk reduction; traffic and transport; Air Pollution; Bicycling; Cities; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Health Behavior; Health Care Costs; Humans; Risk Reduction Behavior; Sweden; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072268060

To reduce this high consumption rate alternative energy sources should be developed. One of the most promising is photovoltaics. This paper presents modeling studies of large scale PV power plant design to fulfil the electricity needs of a small community located in Poland. Based on the energy demand prognosis and monthly solar radiation data PV power plant capacity and a number of modules were computed. The distance between rows of the modules was also determined to avoid the shadowing effect. System configuration and energy production simulations were carried out using DDS-Cad software. Results of energy calculations were compared with the yearly energy needs of the studied community. Reduction of greenhouse gases emission was estimated. Modeling results show that proposed 3.1 MWp photovoltaic plant can produce enough energy to fulfil the yearly energy demand of the households in the studied area. Moreover, significant reduction of CO2 emission and other gaseous pollutants were observed. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Energy management; Energy utilization; Environmental engineering; Fog; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Power plants; Alternative energy source; Energy productions; Gaseous pollutants; Greenhouse gases emissions; PhotoVoltaic plant; Solar radiation data; System configurations; Total energy consumption; Computer aided design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072804649

Soon 4 out of 5 EU citizens are living in cities [6]. The results are increasing costs for health expenses and infrastructure damages. Urban planning processes have to consider future climate conditions and the impact on people, buildings and the urban environment. Until today there was no simple solution to measure and calculate the climate impacts of urban developments. GREENPASS® is a technological breakthrough, the world's first software-based technology for climate-resilient and resource-efficient urban development. After 9 years of scientific research and development the technology can easily be used by urban planners as architects and be integrated into existing urban planning workflows and processes. With GREENPASS® the impact of buildings, materials and plants on urban climate become measurable and comparable in a standardized way - powered by ENVI-met®. It supports optimization of investments towards effects of Green Infrastructure (trees, green roofs and walls, ...) such as cooling, thermal comfort, water retention and carbon sequestration. GREENPASS® allows to identify the optimal solution for any urban development. Supported projects receive finally a GREENPASS® certificate on their overall performance. The technology has already been applied successfully for more than 25 projects within Austria and Europe [3] and will be explained more in detail using the case study of 'FLAIR in the City' - the world's first GREENPASS® Gold-certified residential building, located in Vienna/Austria. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Singapore is the second most densely populated country in the world and its high-rise buildings play a critical role in the urban context offering a significantly larger surface area of walls than roofs. PFs represent an appropriate, novel technological response to a number of issues Singapore is facing such as a high dependence on imported energy and food, scarcity of land, planned reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the increase of high-rise greenery coverage. The potential of PFs in harvesting solar energy, which is currently the most viable renewable energy source (RES), and in utilizing the characteristics of the urban context, is promising. The study analyses the acceptance of the developed PF concept by its potential future users—residents of high-rise public housing blocks. A door-to-door survey was conducted among the residents of the Housing & Development Board (HDB) buildings (consisting of apartments or flats) with two main purposes: examining whether the residents accept or are positively inclined towards the PF concept and its implementation and secondly, identifying their preferences related to aesthetical qualities, use and maintenance of PF designs. The results indicate a highly affirmative response among a very high percentage of respondents towards gardening. They also indicate that PF concepts promoting small-scale VF adequately fit the needs of HDB residents. The preferences of the potential future users regarding PF types are further presented and discussed. The insights obtained will help further the knowledge on PFs and directly assist planners, architects, contractors and decision makers (DMs) as guidelines in the design of PFs in the tropics, enabling such systems to meet the needs, expectations and preferences of users and to address their concerns. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV); Survey; Sustainable buildings; Urban farming; Users' acceptance; Vertical farming","Decision making; Doors; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent buildings; Modular construction; Solar energy; Surveying; Surveys; Tall buildings; Building integrated photovoltaic; Sustainable building; Urban farming; Users' acceptance; Vertical farming; Housing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065733883

Their concentration, species, buffer capacity, and pH value influence the local reaction conditions and impact the product distribution of the electrocatalyst. Relevant properties of prospective solvents include their basicity, CO2 solubility, conductivity, and toxicity, which affect the CO2RR and the applicability of the solvents. The complexity of an electrochemical system impedes the direct correlation between a single parameter and cell performance indicators such as the Faradaic efficiency; thus the effects of different electrolytes are often not fully comprehended.

In this study, all these challenges were overcome by selectively and chemically assembly of oxygen-deficient Bi2WO6 nanosheets onto BiOI nanosheets, forming a novel surface defect-engineered 2D/2D motif with built-in nanoscale p-n heterojunctions. This rational cascade configuration with internal electric field renders ultrafast directional migration and spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, the oxygen vacant sites with abundant trapped electrons serve as the active sites for CO2 reduction and extend the light absorption of the photocatalytic system to NIR region. Combining these propitious properties, our delineated nanoscale p-n heterojunction on the basis of 2D/2D assembly of surface defect-engineered nanosheets presents a new and unprecedented concept for effective generation of charge carriers, directional steering of charge flow and manipulation of surface active sites, which cooperatively lead to superior photocatalytic performance. Notably, our developed oxygen-deficient Bi2WO6/BiOI binanosheets exhibit a remarkably high production yield of CH4, which represents the state-of-the-art visible light-driven CH4 production activity among all the existing 2D BiOI-based and Bi2WO6-based composites. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2D/2D assembly; Charge flow steering; Oxygen vacancy defects; p-n heterojunction; Photocatalytic CO2 reduction","Assembly; Carbon dioxide; Carrier mobility; Climate change; Electric fields; Energy policy; Heterojunctions; Light; Light absorption; Nanosheets; Oxygen; Oxygen vacancies; Photocatalytic activity; Surface defects; Anthropogenic climate changes; Charge flow; CO2 reduction; Internal electric fields; Oxygen vacancy defects; P-n heterojunctions; Photocatalytic performance; Photogenerated charge carriers; Bismuth compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065225437

The response time variations between engine control actuators tend to be significant during transients and necessitate highly complex actuator scheduling routines. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has the potential to significantly reduce control calibration effort as compared to the current methodologies that are based on decentralized feedback control strategies. MPC strategies simultaneously generate all actuator responses by using a combination of current engine conditions and optimization of a control-oriented plant model. To achieve real-time control, the engine model and optimization processes must be computationally efficient without sacrificing effectiveness. Most MPC systems intended for real-time control utilize a linearized model that can be quickly evaluated using a sub-optimal optimization methodology. Online linearization of the engine model is computationally expensive so it should be performed as infrequently as possible. Since engine dynamics are non-linear, a local linearity approximation error occurs during this process. This research presents a method of evaluating the impact of local linear approximation error on the modeled engine torque for a range of operating conditions. Transient experiments show a clear deviation between a non-linear model and its linearized version, which also depends on the type of transient induced. Step transients in engine torque are generally more forgiving with respect to the number of model linearization calculations required as compared to sinusoidal transients. The sinusoidal transients clearly show a narrow frequency range where the deviation in the models is highest. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

Some benthic microalgae (BMA) may be limited by inorganic carbon availability because high photosynthetic rates withdraw a large amount of CO2 and HCO3 – in the top layer of sediment. Investigating the mechanisms that affect carbon acquisition are necessary if we are to fully understand the functioning and structuring processes of these systems. From this, we can better predict the potential impacts of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations on BMA communities. The purpose of this research was to examine a carbon concentrating mechanism used by BMA through their responses to induced carbon limitation. This approach was conducted through the removal of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity using an inhibitor, ethoxyzolamide. Microcosm experiments were performed on intertidal muddy sediments from North Inlet Estuary, SC. Exposure to ethoxyzolamide resulted in a reduction of gross primary productivity (GPP) without a reduction in total BMA biomass. Furthermore, removed CA activity caused BMA cumulative GPP maxima to shift upward toward the surface in the sediment column. Active CA was necessary to maintain high GPP rates in these communities and allowed motile BMA to use a wider portion of the sediment column. Available HCO3 – at lower depths could still be dehydrated into CO2 by microalgae with CA. Changes in global atmospheric CO2 concentrations leading to higher CO2 availability at the atmosphere-sediment interface may alter the structure and function of these BMA systems, and the vertical distribution of GPP. These consequences may have important implications for the biogeochemical cycling occurring in estuaries. © 2019","Carbon acquisition; Carbon concentrating mechanisms; Carbon limitation; CO2; Estuary","benthos; biomass; carbon; carbon sequestration; community dynamics; enzyme; estuarine ecosystem; inhibition; microalga; nutrient limitation; primary production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067877765

Thus, this study aims to categorize experts' perceptions of green spaces through Q-methodology and to identify ways to form a consensus, establish policies in the design and construction process, ultimately aiming to enhance particle reduction effects in urban green spaces. As a result, experts' perceptions were classified into three categories: 'active support,' 'skeptical,' and 'passive support' groups. Experts' opinions on the particle reduction effects of urban green areas are overarchingly agreed upon; however, the priorities involved and methods used in augmenting green space integration require further analysis and mediation.

In the algorithm, an iterative calculation is required to obtain the self-consistency between QM and MM regions, which is a time-consuming step. In the present study, we have proposed a noniterative approach by introducing a linear response approximation (LRA) into the solvation term in the one-electron part of Fock matrix in a hybrid approach between molecular-orbital calculations and a three-dimensional (3D) integral equation theory for molecular liquids (multicenter molecular Ornstein–Zernike self-consistent field [MC-MOZ-SCF]; Kido et al., J. Chem. Phys. 2015, 143, 014103). To save the computational time, we have also developed a fast method to generate electrostatic potential map near solute and the solvation term in Fock matrix, using Fourier transformation (FT) and real spherical harmonics expansion (RSHE). To numerically validate the LRA and FT-RSHE method, we applied the present approach to water, carbonic acid, and their ionic species in aqueous solution. Molecular properties of the solutes were evaluated by the present approach with four different types of initial wave functions and compared with those by the original (MC-MOZ-SCF). We found that an initial wave function considering solvation effects is needed to appropriately reproduce the properties by MC-MOZ-SCF. Furthermore, a benchmark test for 32 solute molecules was performed to evaluate the accuracy of the present approach for solvation free energy (SFE) and measure the speedup ratio for MC-MOZ-SCF. The error of SFE for MC-MOZ-SCF does not correlate with the SFE but increases in proportion to the electronic reorganization energy. Similar to water and carbonic acid, an initial wave function with solvation effects is also important to make the error small. From the averaged speed up ratio, the present approach is 13.5 times faster than MC-MOZ-SCF. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","integral equation theory for molecular liquids; QM/MM-type framework; solvation free energy; three-dimensional solvation structure","Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Computation theory; Fourier transforms; Free energy; Function evaluation; Integral equations; Iterative methods; Linear transformations; Matrix algebra; Molecular modeling; Molecular orbitals; Organic acids; Solvation; Wave functions; Electrostatic potential maps; Linear response approximation; Molecular liquids; QM/MM-type framework; Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics; Solvation free energies; Solvation structure; Spherical harmonics expansions; Orbital calculations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065047105

Yet, our understanding of transitioning residential energy demand in developing country contexts is limited. This paper discusses changing energy service demands in urban low-income households in India, an emerging economy where the largest future growth in energy demand globally is projected to occur, and where 12 million new low-income homes for the urban poor are to be built by the government between 2015 and 2022. Based on mixed quantitative and qualitative methods comprising of surveys, interviews and focus group discussions, we analyze two inter-related questions: how does the demand for energy services change as the ability of low-income households to consume increases; and how do energy related behaviors influence household electricity consumption? We analyze the data collected to rank households according to their ability to consume and to identify the types of, and progression in, energy services acquired. The appliances and associated services pursued are lights, fans, televisions, and refrigerators, with varied energy efficiencies. Analogously, we quantify the influence of behavior in determining electricity consumption, and show that the inclusion of socio-demographic and behavioral factors explain a significant proportion (51%) of the variance in household electricity consumption, along with the role of material factors such as building physical characteristics and appliance stocks. We complement the statistical analysis with qualitative fieldwork and discuss changing energy related behaviors as the ability of households to consume increases. We conclude with recommendations for climate actions that are compatible with development in the growing low-income housing stock. © 2019 The Author(s).

However, a common European renovation project focuses primarily on improving the thermal performance of the building shell by adding insulation to the opaque surfaces and improve the thermal performance of the windows. The potentially positive contribution of renewable energies (RE) in balance with energy efficiency measures is often underestimated. Consequently, a more holistic approach can contribute to a reduction in total net energy demand up to 40-45% for the entire buildings sector. Thus, in order to achieve the goal of GHG emission reduction in an economic most responsible way, the share of RE in a renovation project needs to be increased. However, building renovation projects are becoming - apparently - more complicated if more factors are considered in the planning of a renovation project. Thus, a computational tool for evaluating hundreds of different renovation options, including the implementations of renewable energy resources, to obtain an optimal or nearly optimal set of renovation options is essential. Therefore, a novel planning tool has been developed within the framework of DREEAM project, a project funded by the European Union within the Horizon 2020 research framework. The DREEAM-Tool has been designed in the way that it helps designers and other stakeholders to plan a renovation project of a single building or even on a multi-building scale. The tool was built in the way to optimize the renovation project taking into consideration the most critical factors in planning and decision-making processes, such as the economic or environmental performance. In other words, the tool combines an energy calculation model for a building or multiple building with an economic and environmental assessment to identify and optimize the most beneficial refurbishment solutions. The current study presents the concept of the DREEAM-Tool and shows examples of how the optimal renovation packages of a considered building will be determined and how this will support designers or buildings owners in decision-making processes. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Owing to the relatively fast growth rate, genetic malleability, and carbon neutral production process, cyanobacteria has been recognized as a specialized microorganism with a significant biotechnological perspective. Metabolically engineering cyanobacterial strains have shown great potential for the photosynthetic production of an array of valuable native or non-native chemicals and metabolites with profound agricultural and pharmaceutical significance using CO2 as a building block. In recent years, substantial improvements in developing and introducing novel and efficient genetic tools such as genome-scale modeling, high throughput omics analyses, synthetic/system biology tools, metabolic flux analysis and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated nuclease (CRISPR/cas) systems have been made for engineering cyanobacterial strains. Use of these tools and technologies has led to a greater understanding of the host metabolism, as well as endogenous and heterologous carbon regulation mechanisms which consequently results in the expansion of maximum productive ability and biochemical diversity. This review summarizes recent advances in engineering cyanobacteria to produce biofuel and industrially relevant fine chemicals of high interest.

However, this option requires a large quantity of high-purity oxygen that is usually produced in an energy-intensive air separation unit (ASU). Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a technology with the potential of reducing the costs and energy penalties associated with current state-of-the-art cryogenic ASUs. In this work, the techno-economic performance of a natural gas-fired oxy-combustion cycle with cryogenic ASU is compared with that based on CLC. Two natural gas-fired cycles are considered: (i) staged oxy-fuel natural gas combined cycle as a reference; and (ii) gas-fired CLC with supercritical CO2 cycle. The process models were developed in Aspen Plus® in order to evaluate the thermodynamic performance of the proposed system and to benchmark it against the reference cycle. The results show that the net efficiency of the proposed cycle, including CO2 compression, is more than 51%, which is comparable to that of a conventional natural gas combined cycle with CO2 capture and 2.7% points higher than that of the reference cycle. Moreover, the economic evaluation indicates that a reduction in levelised cost of electricity from £38.3/MWh to £36.1/MWh can be achieved by replacement of the ASU-based oxy-fuel system with CLC. Hence, gas-fired CLC with a supercritical CO2 cycle has high potential for commercialisation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture; Chemical looping combustion; Cryogenic ASU; Natural gas combined cycle; Oxy-fuel turbine; Oxygen production","Benchmarking; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Cryogenics; Economic analysis; Gases; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Carbon sequestration; Chemical looping combustion; Cost of electricity; Economic evaluations; Natural gas combined cycles; Oxy-fuels; Oxygen production; Thermodynamic performance; Combustion; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; combustion; electricity; natural gas; oxygen; power plant; replacement; technological change; thermodynamics; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065057908

As such, public perceptions are central to decarbonize transportation and help capture the co-benefits of reduced local pollution, noise emissions, and oil dependency. However, we observe that the general public is often treated statically and seen as either problematic or peripheral to questions within the transport and energy studies communities. This paper asks two questions. First, given increasing adoption in the Nordic region, how do ordinary members of the public perceive EVs? And second, how do they perceive V2G? With these questions, the paper offers an international and in-depth assessment of public perceptions of EVs and V2G systems across five Nordic countries using original data drawn from eight focus groups. We find eight themes of relevance for future research and policy. These include often discussed insights like an EV's environmental sustainability, range, charging or price, but also insights around themes like social status, sound, and acceleration.

Addressing their air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions is therefore required, while accurate emission factors are needed to logistically optimize their operation. This study characterizes real-world emissions and fuel consumption (FC) of HDDTs and investigates the factors that affect their performance. Twenty-two diesel-fueled, Euro IV to Euro VI, HDDTs of six different manufacturers were measured in the road network of the Hong Kong metropolitan area, using portable emission measurement systems (PEMS). The testing routes included urban, highway and mixed urban/highway driving. The data collected corresponds to a wide range of driving, operating, and ambient conditions. Real-world distance- and energy-based emission levels are presented in a comparative manner to capture the effect of after-treatment technologies and the role of the evolution of Euro standards on emissions performance. The emission factors' uncertainty is analyzed. The impact of speed, road grade and vehicle weight loading on FC and emissions is investigated. An analysis of diesel particulate filter (DPF) regenerations and ammonia (NH3) slip events are presented along with the study of Nitrous oxide (N2O) formation. The results reveal deviations of real-world HDDTs emissions from emission limits, as well as the significant impact of different operating and driving factors on their performance. The occasional high levels of N2O emissions from selective catalytic reduction equipped HDDTs is also revealed, an issue that has not been thoroughly considered so far. © 2019 by the authors.","After-treatment technology; Emission factor; Euro standard; Fuel consumption; Heavy-duty diesel truck (HDDT); Portable emission measurement system (PEMS)","Ammonia; Automobile manufacture; Automobiles; Diesel engines; Energy utilization; Fuel consumption; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Pollution; Roads and streets; Selective catalytic reduction; Trucks; Uncertainty analysis; After-treatment technology; Diesel particulate filters; Emission factors; Emission measurement systems; Emissions performance; Heavy-duty diesel; Road freight traffic; Road transport emissions; Air pollution control equipment; air quality; atmospheric pollution; diesel; emission control; fuel consumption; nitrous oxide; pollution monitoring; traffic emission; trucking; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072243348

The peer-reviewed studies that exist mostly concern a limited number of specific cases, such as DDT, CFCs and endocrine disrupting chemicals. The characteristics of 'chemicals denial' show similarity with those of climate denial, including reliance on fake experts, cherry-picked facts and attacks on scientists, with a key aspect being the questioning of causal relationships.

The hourly concentrations of PM2.5, O3, and NO2 measured at different regulatory monitoring network stations in Ahvaz city were obtained from the Department of Environment (DOE)of the city. Then, for various air quality monitoring stations, the 24-h average concentration of PM2.5, 1-h average of NO2 concentration, and maximum daily 8-h O3 concentrations were calculated using Excel 2010 software. When the maximum daily 8-h ozone means exceeding the value of 35, it was subtracted from 35 to calculate SOMO35 indicator for modeling. Validation of air quality data was performed according to the Aphekom and WHO's methodologies for health impact assessment of air pollution. Year-specific city population and baseline incidence of the health outcomes were obtained. The three-year averages of PM2.5, NO2, and O3 concentrations were 68.95 (±39.86)μg/m3, 135.90 (±47.82)μg/m3, and 38.63 (±12.83)parts-per-billion-volume (ppbv), respectively. SOMO35 values of ozone were 6596.66, 3411.78, and 470.88 ppbv in 2014–2015, 2015–2016, and 2016-2017 years, respectively. The AP and number of natural deaths due to NO2 were higher than PM2.5 except the last year (2016–2017), causing about 39.18%, 40.73%, and 14.39% of deaths within the first, the second, and the third year, respectively. However, for the last year, the natural mortality for PM2.5 was higher than NO2 (34.46% versus 14.39%). The total number of natural mortality caused by PM2.5 and NO2 in all years was 4061 and 4391, respectively. A significant number of deaths was estimated to be attributed to the given air pollutants.

In addition, plugging does not necessarily reduce methane emissions and some categories of plugged wells are high emitters. We analyze strategies and costs of five options for reducing methane emissions from high-emitting AOG wells - those which are unplugged and plugged/vented gas wells. The five options are: plugging without gas venting, plugging with gas venting and flaring, plugging with gas venting and usage, gas flaring only, and gas capture/usage only. Average plugging costs ($37,000 per well) can be justified by the social cost of methane, which considers air quality, climate, and human/ecosystem impacts. Savings as measured by natural gas prices and alternative energy credits can offset low plugging costs (<$15,400 per well) but are not large enough to offset average plugging costs. Nonetheless, reducing methane emissions from AOG wells is a cost-effective strategy for addressing climate change that has comparable costs to some current greenhouse gas mitigation options and can produce co-benefits such as groundwater protection. Therefore, we recommend including the mitigation of AOG wells in climate and energy policies in the U.S., Canada, and other oil-and-gas-producing regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Abandoned wells; Costs; Greenhouse gas emissions; methane emissions; Mitigation; Oil and gas","Air quality; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gas wells; Alternative energy; Cost effective strategies; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Ground water protection; Methane emissions; Mitigation; Natural gas price; Oil and gas; Abandoned wells; cost analysis; emission control; energy policy; environmental policy; gas well; greenhouse gas; methane; mitigation; oil well; strategic approach; Canada; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067046597

With international policymaking gradually taking into account initiatives to tackle climate change, the idea of putting a price on carbon has also received much acclaim. Pricing carbon, in the form of a carbon tax, was put forward as a policy initiative with the commencement of the Paris Climate Summit of 2015, as such a policy, could address emissions at the sources while being the least intrusive with the lowest burden on taxpayers. India is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases globally but has also been a pioneer in acknowledging carbon taxes. The government has claimed its high excise duties on petrol and diesel, along with the Clean Environment Cess on coal consumption, to be implicit carbon taxes. Interestingly, while a carbon tax should be linked to carbon emissions, current indirect taxes by the government are not at all linked to them while are mostly used as revenue generating measures or compensating the States as part of GST revenue losses. This paper envisages to examine the case for introducing a carbon tax regime in India vis-à-vis fossil fuel consumption in the economy, with a subsequent determination of a unique carbon tax rate for India. To achieve India’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets of Paris Summit, it is imperative that India introduces an explicit carbon tax that links fuel prices to emissions, which can have a cascading effect of reducing their consumption while switching to cleaner fuels as substitutes. Findings from the study indicate that coal faces a minimal tax burden while being the most polluting whereas natural gas faces a high tax burden even though it is cleanest among all. As part of the study, a tax rate has been derived that is expected to act as a policy benchmark and can nudge tax policies in the right way, as switching to a low-carbon economy forms a primary agenda of India, in this era of a hothouse Earth. © BEIESP.","Carbon tax; Climate change; Fiscal policy; Social cost of carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075315099

In the last decade, solar energy installations have received an ample impetus in India due to active initiatives taken by the Indian government. However, the solar energy potential of country’s North-Eastern (NE) part is not utilized effectively so far. In the present study, a comprehensive analysis of the feasibility of installation of a megawatt-level grid-connected solar photovoltaic (SPV) power plant in all the state capitals of NE India is carried out. The climatic data collected from various online sources and NASA climatic database were utilized in designing a 2 MW SPV plant. The theoretical procedure involved in designing the SPV plant is also presented in this study. PVsyst simulation software is used to predict the performance of 2 MW power plants for these eight states of India. From the analysis, it is observed that NE India has an immense potential for installation of solar energy conversion devices and thus it can be harvested economically. It has been observed that locations of Guwahati and Gangtok provide a high performance ratio of 0.855. Aizawl provides the minimum unit cost of electricity generated at a value of 3.88 INR/unit.

While such threats have been mapped, their uncertainties from different climate scenarios and longer planning horizons have yet to be addressed from both an exposure assessment and a stakeholder outreach perspective. Therefore, we chose the highly urbanized San Francisco Bay Area as an example to project its flood areas every 20 years between 2000 and 2100, under 24 varied climate scenarios with two greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration levels. We then assessed flood exposure by intersecting the flood areas with demographic and socioeconomic distributions, developed areas, lifeline infrastructures, and emergency responders in low elevation (<10 m) coastal zones. Our median estimates under the low GHG scenarios indicated that 10–38% of the items assessed above are flood-exposed in 2000–2020, with this exposure increasing to 20–54% during 2080–2100. The median estimates under the high GHG scenarios for the same periods are 0–35% and 40–67%, respectively. The expected uncertainties, or standard deviations, of the exposures for a given item assessed above under the low and high GHG scenarios are 1–2% in 2000–2020 and 7–10% in 2080–2100. Despite our modeling capability for a range of climate scenarios over the long term, some stakeholders, particularly those in the private sector, prefer near-term results with lower uncertainties.

The model uses the ADCIRC basin-to-channel scale unstructured grid circulation code forced with Climate Forecast System version 2 reanalysis meteorology. The tidal solution has been validated at 121 shelf and nearshore stations, with lower overall errors than a data assimilated tidal model (FES2012). The ADCIRC model shows considerable skill at simulating tide and coastal surge, and resulting overland flooding on the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, during both summer and winter storms. The root-mean-square-error of the model does not exceed 20 cm at any station, outperforming the Global Ocean Forecasting System (GOFS 3.1), a 1/12∘ data assimilated ocean general circulation model which is coupled to sea ice physics. The ADCIRC model incorporates the effect of sea ice through parameterizations of the wind drag coefficient, modifying the air–sea momentum transfer under ice coverage. Three large winter storms with distinctly different ice coverages along the coasts of western Alaska were chosen to exhibit the variable effect of sea ice on the resulting storm surge. Under forming coastal ice coverage, local increases in water levels due to ice is seen in coastal areas, and under predominantly dense pack ice, an increase in momentum transfer in the marginal sea ice at the shelf break leads to an increase in sea levels across the entire Bering Sea, both commensurate with observations. Under the most variable ice fields, results are mixed, in part due to uncertainties in the air–sea–ice drag parameterization such as related to the assumption that sea ice drift and wind velocities are always well correlated. Including a description of sea ice drift and current speeds explicitly in the air–sea–ice drag formulation and considering wave–surge–ice interaction should improve the description of momentum transferred to the water column and resulting simulation of surge. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alaska; High resolution; Sea ice; Storm surge; Tides","Climate models; Drag; Floods; Mean square error; Momentum; Momentum transfer; Ocean currents; Sea level; Storms; Tides; Water levels; Alaska; High resolution; High-resolution models; Ocean general circulation models; Root mean square errors; Sea ice conditions; Storm surges; Unstructured grid; Sea ice; computer simulation; data assimilation; image resolution; modeling; ocean tide; sea ice; storm surge; Alaska; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069875480

Here, results are presented from a 26-year study (1989–2015) of wet precipitation collected at Paradise Station (1654 m above sea level), Mount Rainier National Park, Washington, USA. Weekly samples were analyzed for pH, conductivity and major anions and cations. While precipitation concentrations for sulfate, nitrate, protons and conductivity peaked in the early 2000s, overall trends decreased by 54%, 46%, 41%, and 37%, respectively. Associated pH values increased from 5.2 to 5.6, and were largely controlled by non-sea-salt contributions of sulfate and neutralizing calcium, potassium and magnesium. Between 1999 and 2015, nitrogen (N) deposition rates from ammonium increased by a factor of 3.6, from 0.27 to 0.96 kg N ha−1 yr−1 (p = 0.02), while nitrate deposition did not change statistically (0.91–0.74 kg N ha−1 yr−1, p = 0.30). Combined, these N sources are reaching reported critical loads of 2.0 kg N ha−1 yr−1. Results indicate that emission regulations focused on stationary sources have effectively decreased apparent acid precipitation, however, increased nitrogen deposition from ammonium may lead to further fertilization and acidification of delicate soils and waters. Continued long-term monitoring is thus imperative to track continued anthropogenic inputs to vulnerable ecosystems. © 2019","Acid deposition; Ammonium; High-elevation; Long-term; Mount rainier national park; Nitrate","Air pollution; Deposition rates; Ecosystems; Fuels; Nitrogen; Precipitation (meteorology); Sea level; Sulfur compounds; Acid deposition; Ammonium; High elevation; Long-term; National parks; Nitrates; ammonia; anion; calcium; cation; magnesium; nitrate; potassium; proton; sulfate; water; acid deposition; acidification; ammonium; anthropogenic source; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; combustion; elevation; entrainment; long-term change; nitrate; pH; precipitation (climatology); sea surface salinity; acid precipitation; acidification; Article; atmospheric deposition; chemistry; conductance; dry deposition; method detection limit; pH; precipitation; priority journal; United States; wet deposition; Mount Rainier National Park; Pacific Northwest; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066250766

International trade has played a critical role in effectively and efficiently allocating resources in the process of economic globalization. Through international trade, part of the responsibilities for CO2 emission mitigation which should have been taken by consumers have been transferred to the producers of traded goods and resources. The focus of this research is on the re-examination of the EKC hypothesis, taking the role of international trade into account. The findings are as follows. In the first stage, we calculated the CO2 emissions of 39 countries using the input-output analysis approach based on production accounting and consumption accounting. Currently, China is the largest CO2 emitter, surpassing the U.S. However, the per capita CO2 emissions of China lag behind those of the U.S. In the second stage, although both an inverted U-shaped curve and an N-shaped curve were obtained, the cubic functional form model is better fitted. In addition, the turning point occurs earlier if adopting the production-based accounting rather than adopting the consumption-based accounting, implying that international trade postpones the peak time of global CO2 emissions. From the above analysis, it follows that when testing for the validity of the EKC for global CO2 emissions, the role of trade cannot be overstated. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; EKC hypothesis; Input-output analysis; International trade","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; environmental economics; input-output analysis; international trade; Kuznets curve; trade-environment relations; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070644697

Understanding the growth and potential peak of CO2 emissions in various sectors and various provinces of China has great significance to formulate more targeted strategies on capping emissions on a national level. This issue has recently attracted increasing attention but remains far from being resolved. Therefore, this article critically reviews the current literature regarding sectoral- and provincial-level CO2 emission projections for China, to determine up-to-date study progresses and guide future studies. It has been concluded that China's various sectors and provinces present large gaps with respect to the time and the quantity to peak their CO2 emissions. Energy-extensive heavy industry sectors, such as cement, iron and steel, and electricity sectors, take the lead in capping CO2 emissions compared with service, transport, and building sectors. In addition, the eastern provinces are expected to achieve the peak of CO2 emissions prior to the central and western provinces, while more economically and technically advanced provinces reach this peak ahead of less developed and energy-producing provinces. Based on the significantly different dynamics and drivers of CO2 emissions, sectoral- and provincial-specific strategies on emission abatement are outlined for China. Moreover, four critical topics are highlighted for future study, including improvement of study methodology, detailed examination of CO2 emission trends in several key sectors and provinces, and in-depth exploration of the far-reaching impacts of capping CO2 emissions in China and associated countermeasures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Peak of CO2 emission; Progress; Prospects; Sectors and provinces","Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Global warming; China; CO2 emissions; Progress; Prospects; Sectors and provinces; Iron and steel industry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067471403

Reducing the requirement of carbon source by manipulating the nitrogen removal pathway from conventional nitrification-denitrification to partial nitrification-denitrification is considered as an efficient solution. In this article, the feasibility of combining free nitrous acid (FNA) sludge treatment and DO control to achieve partial nitrification-denitrification in a continuous flow system (aerobic-anoxic-oxic process) using real sewage was assessed. The nitrite pathway was rapidly established in the experimental reactor within 23 days by simultaneously lowering DO concentration in aerobic zone to 0.5 mg/L and treating 30% of the activated sludge per day from the reactor in the FNA sludge treatment unit with FNA concentration of 1.2 mg N/L and exposure time of 18 h. The nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) were efficiently washed out and the partial nitrification process could maintain stable in the experimental reactor even after cease of FNA treatment and increase of DO concentrations in the main stream to 1.5 mg/L, with an average nitrite accumulation rate of above 78%. In contrast, the nitrite accumulation rate was just around 58% during low DO concentrations phase and declined quickly to below 1% after the DO concentrations were increased to 1.5 mg/L in the control reactor which only utilized single strategy of DO control to achieve nitrite pathway. Moreover, a better sludge settleability and nitrogen removal performance could also be realized in the experimental reactor. The results of nitrifying bacteria activities and quantities detection demonstrated that although NOB activities in both reactors were effectively inhibited, a certain amount of NOB (6.26 × 106 copies/g MLSS) were remained in the control reactor and multiplied rapidly as the DO concentration increased, which might break down the partial nitrification. Furthermore, the quantity results of nitrogen cycling related functional genes showed that the increment of the ratio of nitrate reduced bacteria to total bacteria was 0.35% larger than that of nitric oxide bacteria in the control reactor, while those two ratios increased similarly by 1.11% and 1.12% in the experimental reactor, respectively, which might be one potential cause of reduction in N2O emission of nitrite pathway achieved by FNA-based technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bacteria community; Continuous process; DO control; Free nitrous acid; Low C/N real sewage; Nitrite pathway","Activated sludge process; Aerobic bacteria; Carbon; Denitrification; Dissolved oxygen sensors; Experimental reactors; Inorganic acids; Nitration; Nitric oxide; Nitrification; Nitrogen removal; Sewage; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Bacteria community; Continuous process; DO control; Free nitrous acids; Nitrite pathway; Process control; nitrite; nitrogen; nitrous acid; nitrite; nitrogen; accumulation rate; bacterium; bioreactor; concentration (composition); denitrification; dissolved oxygen; experimental study; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrification; nitrifying bacterium; nitrite; nitrogen; nitrous acid; pollutant removal; sewage; wastewater treatment plant; activated sludge; Article; concentration (parameter); feasibility study; nitrification; nitrifying bacterium; nitrogen cycling; nonhuman; priority journal; sewage treatment; sludge treatment; waste component removal; bioreactor; China; denitrification; sewage; China; Bioreactors; China; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Nitrous Acid; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067600149

Unlike better-studied northern hemisphere systems, many Australian subtropical wetlands undergo extreme wet/dry oscillations, which may strongly impact methane dynamics. We assessed diurnal methane emissions of multiple pathways during three distinct seasonal events within an Australian freshwater wetland. Six-fold higher methane emissions occurred during summer compared to autumn floods (which followed an extensive dry-period) and winter/cool conditions. Over three seasons, diffusion represented the highest average areal fluxes (25.9 ± 73.2 mmol m−2 d−1) but were within range of fluxes through water lily aerenchyma (20.8 ± 41.5 mmol m−2 d−1). Average ebullition rates were 5.5 ± 9.7 mmol m−2 d−1. Water column CH4 displayed high spatiotemporal variability, ranging from 55.0 to 253.5 μmol L−1. Time series δ13C–CH4 isotope measurements revealed an oxidation fraction of ~ 15% at night-time and ~ 36% during day-time, and night-time diffusive fluxes were consistently ~ three-fold higher than day-time fluxes. By aggregating seasons and weighting for changes in lily coverage, plant-mediated fluxes accounted for ~ 59% of the annual methane emissions, whereas ebullition and diffusion each accounted for ~ 20%. The up-scaled annual area-weighted wetland methane flux (combined pathways) was 27.3 ± 36.7 mmol m−2 d−1. We contend that water lilies (Nymphaea sp.) are the significant carbon source, mediator, and conduit for methane fluxes in this system, and the extremely large seasonal variability of methane emissions reflect dynamic redox oscillations driven by oscillating wet and dry conditions. © 2019 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",,"carbon flux; emission; flux measurement; freshwater; methane; seasonal variation; shallow water; subtropical region; wetland; Lilium; Nymphaea; Nymphaeaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065306541

We investigated effects of a concentrated solar power (CSP) trough facility on invertebrate communities in the arid Northern Cape province of South Africa. Epigaeic and flying invertebrates were sampled using pitfall and sticky traps in three habitats: solar field, power block and surrounding rangeland. There were no significant differences in abundance or order richness in either epigaeic or flying invertebrate communities across the three habitats. Shannon diversity was significantly lower in rangeland plots for epigaeic invertebrates, and significantly greater in solar field for flying invertebrates. Despite the lack of significant differences in order richness or abundance, community composition of both invertebrate groups differed significantly between habitats, but the two habitats within the plant only differed for epigaeic invertebrate assemblages. Differences in invertebrate densities and composition demonstrate an effect of construction of the facility on invertebrate communities. While facilities may have relatively small footprints, the rate at which the industry is expanding internationally suggests that further research on impacts and mitigation measures is needed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CSP parabolic trough; Habitat loss; Invertebrate abundance; Invertebrate diversity; Solar energy","abundance estimation; anthropogenic effect; arid environment; biodiversity; habitat loss; invertebrate; pitfall trap; power plant; solar power; species diversity; species occurrence; Northern Cape; South Africa; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066247979

Design/methodology/approach: Several methods and algorithms have been proposed for systems forecasting in various fields. One of the strongest methods for modeling complex systems is neuro-fuzzy that refers to combinations of artificial neural network and fuzzy logic. When the system becomes more complex, the conventional algorithms may fail for network training. In this paper, an integrated approach, including ANFIS and metaheuristic algorithms, is used for increasing forecast accuracy. Findings: Power generation in power plants is dependent on various factors, especially climate factors. Operating power plant in Iran is very much influenced because of climate variation, including from tropical to subpolar, and severely varying temperature, humidity and air pressure for each region and each season. On the other hands, when wind speed and wind direction are used simultaneously, the training process does not converge, and the forecasting process is unreliable. The real case study is mentioned to show the ability of the proposed approach to remove the limitations. Originality/value: First, ANFIS is applied for forecasting based on climate factors, including wind speed and wind direction, that have rarely been used simultaneously in previous studies. Second, the well-known and more widely used metaheuristic algorithms are applied to improve the learning process for forecasting output power and compare the results. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Energy production; Energy sector; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Fuzzy-logic model; Neural networks; Operation management; Thermal power","Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Computer circuits; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Optimization; Power plants; Wind; Energy productions; Energy sector; Fuzzy logic model; Operation management; Thermal power; Fuzzy inference",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063318013

However, information on how the spatial distribution of specific crops has changed over time across the globe is relatively sparse.

Specifically, PCAM downscales annual and national-scale data on the crop-specific area harvested of 17 major crops to a global 0.5-degree grid from 1961 to 2014. To do this, pixels are assigned into probability clusters based upon crop-specific pixel suitability (based on mean climate and soil characteristics) and gridded historical agricultural areas. PCAM maps compare relatively well with an existing gridded dataset of crop-specific areas circa 2000 (simple matching coefficient value >0.8 for all crops). PCAM estimates compare less well with time series county-level agricultural census data for the United States. Importantly, deviations between census data and PCAM benchmark estimates (driven by soil and climate suitability) can be used to infer the importance of other factors of agricultural production (e.g. labor, agricultural policy, extreme climate) in future work. Our results provide new insights into the likely changes in the spatial distribution of major crops over the past half-century. © 2019 The Author(s).

Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of ecosystem functions at local scales may facilitate predictions of the resistance and resilience of these functions to change. We evaluated how riverine bacterial community assembly and predicted gene content corresponded to decomposition rates of green leaf inputs from red alder trees into rivers of Washington State, USA. Previously, we documented accelerated decomposition rates for leaves originating from trees growing adjacent to the site of decomposition versus more distant locales, suggesting that microbes have a “home-field advantage” in decomposing local leaves. Here, we identified repeatable stages of bacterial succession, each defined by dominant taxa with predicted gene content associated with metabolic pathways relevant to the leaf characteristics and course of decomposition. “Home” leaves contained bacterial communities with distinct functional capacities to degrade aromatic compounds. Given known spatial variation of alder aromatics, this finding helps explain locally accelerated decomposition. Bacterial decomposer communities adjust to intraspecific variation in leaves at spatial scales of less than a kilometer, providing a mechanism for rapid response to changes in resources such as range shifts among plant genotypes. Such rapid responses among bacterial communities in turn may maintain high rates of carbon and nutrient cycling through aquatic ecosystems. © 2019 Jackrel et al.","Aquatic decomposition; Bacterial metabolism; Bacterial metabolism; Ecosystem subsidies; Environmental filtering; Intraspecific variation; Plant defensive chemistry","aromatic compound; alder; Article; bacterial metabolism; biodiversity; bioremediation; carbon cycling; community succession; controlled study; decomposition; degradation kinetics; environmental change; evolutionary rate; genotype; microbial community; microbiome; nonhuman; nutrient cycling; plant leaf; prediction; priority journal; adaptation; bacterium; ecosystem; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; plant leaf; tree; Washington; Adaptation, Physiological; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Microbiota; Plant Leaves; Trees; Washington",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071743788

Virginia Street, Reno, NV  89557, United States","During wintertime, Salt Lake City experiences periods of high-pressure atmospheric stagnation that leads to prolonged periods with stable atmospheric boundary layers (ABL) due to the unique orography of the region. These atmospheric conditions typically lead to persistent cold air pool (PCAP) events, where the stable ABL remains over several days, degrading air quality in the Salt Lake Valley. In this work, we applied novel source apportionment methods to identify sources that were the greatest contributors to elevated secondary PM2.5 concentrations during PCAP events in winter 2007. A source-oriented modeling approach that relies on emissions inventory data (i.e., source-specific data) was utilized for source characterization. A correction was applied to chemical transport model (CTM) outputs to improve the estimates of source contributions to secondary PM2.5 components (organic carbon, nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium). As a result, gasoline vehicles (25%), natural gas combustion (21%), and other sources (29%) were identified as the largest sources of nitrate, which was the dominant aerosol component during the PCAP periods ([NO3−]max = 37.5 μg m−3). Further, receptor-oriented source apportionment modeling was conducted using the chemical mass balance method with gas constraints (CMB-GC) with location-specific, mathematically optimized PM2.5 source profiles to examine the multi-year trend in PCAP pollution. These optimized profiles were enhanced by integrating the initial guess profiles with CTM results and observations. CMB-GC was applied for the period 2007–2015 at an urban monitor, and the use of seasonally varying optimized source profiles improved results by resolving more mass than when using static source profiles, increasing the predicted-observed PM2.5 mass ratio from 0.91 to 1.03. The averaged biomass burning impacts exhibited the most significant change, increasing from an average of 0.85 to 1.87 μg m−3 when using the static profiles and the optimized profiles, respectively. The static and optimized CMB-GC results were similar for secondary components but differed slightly for mobile impacts. Stratification of PCAP vs. non-PCAP CMB-GC source impacts revealed that the dominant sources of PM2.5 varied under the two meteorological conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Particulate matter; Persistent cold air pool; Salt Lake City; Source apportionment","Air quality; Atmospheric boundary layer; Atmospheric chemistry; Lakes; Natural gas vehicles; Nitrates; Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Sulfur compounds; Chemical transport models; Cold air pools; Fine particulate matter; Meteorological condition; Particulate Matter; Salt Lake City; Source apportionment; Stable atmospheric boundary layer; Particles (particulate matter); ammonia; coal; fuel oil; gasoline; metal; natural gas; nitrate; organic carbon; receptor; sulfate; aerosol; air quality; biomass burning; boundary layer; chemical mass balance; cold air; concentration (composition); natural gas; particulate matter; source apportionment; spatiotemporal analysis; aerosol; air quality; aircraft; Article; biomass; burn; cold air; combustion; dust; fire; meteorology; nonhuman; particulate matter; priority journal; salt lake; stratification; uncertainty; winter; Salt Lake City; Salt Lake Valley; United States; Utah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068093638

The COMMENT code is dedicated to coupled transfer applications in the fields of thermal, fluid mechanics and chemical engineering, both solid and gaseous states being assessed. Phenomena like continuity, species transport, heat transfer, turbulence and chemical reactions were taken into account. Plasma gasification of forest residues was simulated within defined conditions and assumptions, the producer gas being monitored and characterized. The presented model was validated against literature data. A high level of agreement between the numerical and the experimental values was achieved, proving that the model is robust and suitable for the proposed goal. This new model requires low computational capacity and allows a wide range of reactor types to be used in the gasification process. A parametric study was also conducted in order to understand the influence of some variables on gasification products and their concentrations along the runs. It was possible to conclude that lower equivalence ratios (ER) favored H2 and CO production as well as lower heating value (LHV), while higher ER values enhanced N2 contents, carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) and minor alterations were observed for CH4 and CO2. H2, N2 and CO2 as well as CCE and cold-gas efficiency (CGE) were also enhanced by higher steam-to-biomass ratios (SBR), while CO content and LHV dropped, CH4 remaining almost unaltered. For higher temperatures H2, CO and N2 levels were improved as well as LHV, whereas CO2 and CGE were reduced and CH4 remained unchanged. The results showed that the model proposed in this study is a promising tool for simulating the plasma gasification process of biomass within a gasifier. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; CFD; Forest residues; Plasma gasification model","Biomass; Calorific value; Carbon dioxide; Codes (symbols); Computational fluid dynamics; Efficiency; Fluid mechanics; Forestry; Heat transfer; Thermal Engineering; Cold gas efficiency; Computational capacity; Forest residue; Gasification process; Gasification products; Lower heating value; New mathematical model; Plasma gasification; Gasification; biomass power; chemical reaction; computational fluid dynamics; experimental study; model validation; numerical model; plant residue; plasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067601621

This study employed annual data from 13 regions of Saudi Arabia, from 2003 to 2013. The data were analyzed on the basis of panel regression models-fixed effect, random effect, and the pooled ordinary least square. The findings show that temperature, rainfall, sandstorms, and number of vehicles were statistically and significantly responsible for RTAs in Saudi Arabia in the study period. This study also found that RTAs both inside and outside cities significantly caused injuries, but only RTAs inside cities significantly caused death. Furthermore, the death from RTAs injuries was found to be statistically significant only for motor vehicle accidents.

However, regional differences in ozone sensitivity to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a major precursor, have not been quantitatively shown. Therefore, this study estimated the spatial variations in the efficacy of VOC emission reductions to mitigate photochemical ozone concentrations and population exposure (as related to ozone-related health problems) over Japan, and to inform policy makers pursuing effective ozone reduction strategies in polluted regions. Using air quality simulations, we found that the abovementioned efficacy differed substantially, up to 10-fold, among 20 × 20-km areas in which VOCs had been reduced. Using the above-calculated spatial distribution of the efficacy and data on emission source locations of several industries, upstream industries (e.g., petroleum and coal products) showed greater reduction efficacies than downstream industries (e.g., plastic products). By comparing the calculated ozone sensitivity to VOCs with the ozone–NOx–VOC sensitivity derived from space-based observations of the HCHO/NO2 column ratio from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, the general spatial trends in ozone sensitivity to VOC emission reductions were verified qualitatively. Thus, regional countermeasures should be considered rather than the existing uniform nationwide measures in Japan. Moreover, to prioritize VOC emission reductions by industry, considering the reactivity or ozone formation potential of each emitted VOC exclusively, as is currently done, is insufficient, the emission locations of each industry should also be considered. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Chemical transport model; Mitigation policy; Photochemical indicators; Sensitivity; Surface ozone; VOC emissions","atmospheric modeling; atmospheric transport; concentration (composition); emission control; environmental indicator; mitigation; ozone; photochemistry; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; pollution policy; sensitivity analysis; spatial variation; volatile organic compound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070387202

One ecologically relevant approach consists of examining the thermal responses of a large number of traits, both related with population dynamics and trophic interactions (i.e. a multi-trait approach). Based on in situ climatic data and projections from climate models, we here designed two daily fluctuating thermal regimes realistically reflecting current and future conditions in Eastern France. These models detected an increase in mean temperature and in the range of daily thermal fluctuations as two local facets of global warming likely to occur in our study area by the end of this century. We then examined the responses of several fitness-related traits in caterpillars of the moth Lobesia botrana – including development, pupal mass, survival rates, energetic reserves, behavioral and immune traits expressed against parasitoids – to this experimental imitation of global warming. Increasing temperatures positively affected development (leading to a 31% reduction in the time needed to complete larval stage), survival rates (+19%), and movement speed as a surrogate for larval escape ability to natural enemies (+60%). Conversely, warming elicited detrimental effects on lipid reserves (−26%) and immunity (total phenoloxidase activity: −34%).

The brain is presented as a direct target of particulate matter (PM) exposure because of the nose-to-brain pathway involvement. The main cause of contamination in nuclear occupational activities is related to exposure to aerosols containing radionuclides, particularly uranium dust. It has been previously demonstrated that instilled solubilized uranium in the rat nasal cavity is conveyed to the brain via the olfactory nerve. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the anatomical localization of uranium compounds in the olfactory system after in vivo exposure to a polydisperse aerosol of uranium tetraoxide (UO4) particles. METHODS: The olfactory neuroepithelium (OE) and selected brain structures—olfactory bulbs (OB), frontal cortex (FC), hippocampus (HIP), cerebellum (Cer), and brainstem (BS)—were microdissected 4 h after aerosol inhalation via a nose-only system in adult rats. Tissues were subjected to complementary analytical techniques. RESULTS: Uranium concentrations measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were significantly higher in all brain structures from exposed animals compared with their respective controls. We observed that cerebral uranium concentrations followed an anteroposterior gradient with typical accumulation in the OB, characteristic of a direct olfactory transfer of inhaled compounds. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) microscopy and transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDX) were used in order to track elemental uranium in situ in the olfactory epithelium. Elemental uranium was detected in precise anatomical regions: olfactory neuron dendrites, paracellular junctions of neuroepithelial cells, and olfactory nerve tracts (around axons and endoneural spaces). CONCLUSION: These neuroanatomical observations in a rat model are consistent with the transport of elemental uranium in different physicochemical forms (solubilized, nanoparticles) along olfactory nerve bundles after inhalation of UO4 microparticles. This work contributes to knowledge of the mechanistic actions of particulate pollutants on the brain. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4927. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

With the intent of reducing emissions from this sector, this research proposes the utilization of the jet stream to transport a combination of cargo and hydrogen, using airships or balloons at altitudes of 10–20 km. The jet streams flow in the mid-latitudes predominantly in a west–east direction, reaching an average wind speed of 165 km/h. Using this combination of high wind speeds and reliable direction, hydrogen-filled airships or balloons could carry hydrogen with a lower fuel requirement and shorter travel time compared to conventional shipping. Jet streams at different altitudes in the atmosphere were used to identify the most appropriate circular routes for global airship travel. Round-the-world trips would take 16 days in the Northern Hemisphere and 14 in the Southern Hemisphere. Hydrogen transport via the jet stream, due to its lower energy consumption and shorter cargo delivery time, access to cities far from the coast, could be a competitive alternative to maritime shipping and liquefied hydrogen tankers in the development of a sustainable future hydrogen economy. © 2019 The Author(s)","Airships; Balloons; Cargo; Hydrogen; Hydrogen economy; Jet stream; Shipping","Airships; Balloons; Energy utilization; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Liquefied gases; Ships; Travel time; Wind; Cargo; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen transport; Jet streams; Maritime shipping; Northern Hemispheres; Reducing emissions; Southern Hemisphere; Freight transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073646739

Greening the road transportation that accounts for 95% of sectoral emissions, is a vital challenge in order to reduce greenhouse gasses' emissions and air pollution as well to improve public health and comfort given that road transportation directly affects urban areas. In the present paper, we consider a university campus that experiences severe congestion due to being located in the middle of a skyscraper area in metropolitan city of Istanbul. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation in order to find an optimal routing plan for a university E-shuttle service considering a number of characteristics including driving ranges, distances and time limits, and bus stop nodes. Our exact cost optimal solution composed of vehicle purchasing and distance costs resulted in a single vehicle to be assigned where all the bus stop nodes are visited in a complete tour. Considering the strategy of the university towards a zero emission campus area, our solution helps to save considerable amount of CO2 exhaust compared with the current shuttle plan. © 2019 IEEE.","electric vehicle routing; optimization; smart mobility","Air pollution; Bus terminals; Economic and social effects; Electric vehicles; Fossil fuels; Office buildings; Optimization; Roads and streets; Tall buildings; Urban transportation; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Cost-optimal solutions; Environmental health; Metropolitan cities; Mixed integer linear programming; Road transportation; Severe congestion; Shuttle services; University campus; Integer programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075636023

Climate change adaptation and smart cities are emerging topics in the climate change and sustainability domain. Therefore, this paper aims to achieve a better understanding of policy consequences and exploring synergies of climate change adaptation and smart cities are valuable for both research and practice. Design/methodology/approach: This paper systematically reviews synergies of smart city applications in urban climate change adaptation literature. A systematic literature review and content analysis are carried out to answer the research questions and a theoretically based smart cities concept matrix with synergetic coproduction theory is used to assess the empirical studies. Findings: Key findings are that the model of synergetic coproduction could identify the benefits co-existing in smart city and climate change adaptation. While smart people and smart government play the fundamental roles, synergies could co-occur in other smart city dimensions. Smart city applications in climate change adaptation could increase competitiveness in cities by exploiting the opportunities as well as reducing the harmful risks. Research limitations/implications: The outcomes of the smart city applications in climate change adaptation aim to contribute to the exploration of developing indicators for smart city studies in climate change. Practical implications: The findings provide successful examples for city governments and stakeholders to identify the low-hanging fruits as well as win-win adaptations. The results could also serve as the exploration of indicators in the field of smart city in climate change. The smart cities concept with the synergetic coproduction theoretical model could be further developed into a sustainability accounting and reporting methodology for cities to improve their sustainability information management. Social implications: The successful cases showing benefits could serve as examples for public-private partnerships to develop strategies to exploit opportunities in smart city applications and climate change adaptation. The review results also show that the integrated approach of smart city and climate change adaptation is possible and beneficial – hopefully the city managers and policymakers will continue to apply the integrated approach with smart city and further climate action agenda. Originality/value: This study combines two emerging topics in the assessment, climate change adaptation and smart cities, and represents a new way of assessing literature and possibly policy outcomes for the cities. By using the theoretical framework from smart cities and theory of coproduction, a theory-based framework is developed for assessing the empirical studies of climate adaptation in cities. The findings from the systematic literature review indicate relations among smart city dimensions in a clear manner and also identify the synergies of smart cities and climate adaptation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Benefits; Climate change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068102332

In this paper, such a carbon catalyst is prepared through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-supported precursor pyrolysis. Compared with the direct pyrolysis of polypyrrole@cobalt salt precursor, the incorporation of dicyanodiamide as the CVD source facilitates the diversification and hierarchization of carbon morphology, the reduction of Co particle size, and the increase of the proportion of interfacial Co−N−C and pyridinic-N. The catalyst is composed of in-situ-grown multiple-morphology carbons (MMCs) with metallic Co particles embedded, where the MMCs are a combination of nano-particles, -rods, and -wires, all comprised by small N-doped carbon nanoflakes. Owing to the combined modulation on morphology configurations and defect states, the Co/MMCs catalyst demonstrates excellent activities toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A half-wave potential of 0.84 V and low overpotentials of 86 and 180 mV at 10 mA cm−2 current density for HER and OER are achieved, respectively.

The impact of the intensification of extreme precipitation on mixed communities of CAM plants and dryland C4 grasses remains poorly understood. Methods: Through a set of greenhouse experiments we investigated the effect of increasing intraseasonal rainfall variability on two separate pairs of CAM and C4 grass species (C. imbricata and B. eriopoda; O. phaeacantha and B. curtipendula) that coexist in arid grasslands across the southwest USA. Results: The increased rainfall variability did not significantly change the biomass of C. imbricata while increasing the biomass of B. eriopoda when these two species coexisted. More extreme rainfall regimes caused a 24.8% decrease in B. curtipendula (grass) biomass, compared with a 71.3% decline in the O. phaeacantha CAM plant. Significantly lower nocturnal carbon assimilation rates and higher stem volume-to-surface area ratios were found in CAM plants in mixture than in monoculture. Conclusions: Our study suggests that C4 grasses may outcompete CAM plants through greater access to deep soil water under increased rainfall variability and highlights the important role of hydrologic conditions as determinants of the competitive relations between CAM plants and grasses, their community composition, and ecological resilience in dryland ecosystems. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Crassulacean acid metabolism; Drylands; Rainfall variability; Soil water distribution; Water stress","arid region; biomass allocation; C4 plant; climate change; coexistence; community dynamics; competition (ecology); crassulacean acid metabolism; dryland farming; ecological impact; ecosystem function; experimental study; extreme event; grass; greenhouse ecosystem; monoculture; plant community; precipitation intensity; seasonal variation; soil water; water stress; United States; Crassulaceae; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069156520

Changes in land cover are one of the drivers for variability in frequency and magnitude of extreme climate at regional and local levels. In this study, a regional climate model (COSMO-CLM v4.8) is used to simulate effects in climate extremes from two different idealized land cover change scenarios in Europe. These two simulations involve abrupt large-scale conversion of today forestland to herbaceous vegetation (deforestation), and of today cropland to evergreen needle-leave forest (afforestation). A control simulation with today land cover distribution is used to identify differences in extreme climate. We find significant changes in extreme climate in both deforestation and afforestation simulations, with seasonal and spatial differences. Deforestation causes a warmer summer (with higher annual maximum temperature) and a colder winter (with lower annual minimum temperature). Afforestation slightly increases the average intensity of the hot extremes, although with high spatial variability (a reduction is common in several locations), and mitigates cold extremes in winter. Changes in extreme indices show that deforestation increases both the frequency and duration of hot and cold extremes, while afforestation causes a lower frequency of extreme cold climate. The two simulations show opposing results in the number of frozen days, as they increase for deforestation and decrease for afforestation. A drier climate is found after deforestation, whereas a wetter climate is observed after afforestation. In general, deforestation and afforestation increase the frequency of hot extreme climate as they reduce the return period and increase the return level. Overall, our findings show the potential critical effects that land cover changes can have on climate extremes, and the possible synergies that land management strategies and planning can have for climate change mitigation and adaptation at a regional scale. © 2019 The Authors","Afforestation; Climate extremes; Deforestation; Land cover change; Maximum temperature and precipitation; Regional climate model","Climate models; Deforestation; Reforestation; Afforestation; Climate extremes; Land-cover change; Maximum temperature; Regional climate modeling; Climate change; adaptive management; afforestation; climate effect; climate modeling; deforestation; evergreen forest; extreme event; herb; land cover; mitigation; precipitation (climatology); return period; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065990319

However, its denitrification ability is low in the SPD process due to its poor carbon availability. In this study, sawdust samples were pretreated to various degrees, and then filled into SPD bioreactors to reveal the relationship between carbon availability and denitrification behaviors. The behaviors include the denitrification process, internal effects of major factors (carbon availability, pH and temperature), and the presence of bacterial communities. Results shown that the long-term denitrification rate of pretreated sawdust was increased by 4.5–4.8 times over that of untreated sawdust (29.3 mg N L−1 sawdust d−1). However, despite improving the pretreatment degree of the sawdust in the bioreactor, the long-term denitrification rate shown no further increase. The denitrification rate was most influenced by the temperature, followed by the pH, and then the sawdust pretreatment degree. The denitrification rate increased with decreasing pH and rising temperature of the pretreated sawdust. The removed nitrate was rarely converted into nitrite or nitrous oxide, but ammonium was produced at high pH and temperature for the pretreated sawdust. The adverse effects of ammonium and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reduced when the pH of the pretreated sawdust was lowered to 6.5. Hydrolytic and denitrifying bacteria formed the main SPD bioreactor bacteria, whose abundances increased with increasing sawdust pretreatment degree. The results were beneficial to reduce the hydrolytic retention time and adverse products for the SPD system using woody carbon source. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Available carbon; Bacterial community; Factor interaction; Solid-phase denitrification; Woody biomass","ammonia; carbon; nitrite; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; nitric acid derivative; bacterium; biomass; bioreactor; denitrification; dissolved organic carbon; hydrolysis; nitrate; nitrite; Article; biochemical oxygen demand; carbon source; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; denitrification; denitrifying bacterium; empty bed residence time; microbial community; pH; response surface method; sawdust; solid; temperature; total organic carbon; waste component removal; waste water; bioreactor; wood; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bioreactors; Carbon; Denitrification; Nitrates; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068033129

Detection of abundant putative (or novel) nitric oxide dismutase-encoding gene PCR products could confer the diversity of nitric oxide dismutase in additional microbial groups other than the two known lineages, but the distribution pattern of nod gene is unclear in different environments including oil reservoirs. Here, we surveyed the distribution and diversity of nod genes by clone library sequencing together with the inference of 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomy by amplicon sequencing in diverse samples including wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), wetland, hydrocarbon-contaminated soil, and oil reservoirs. A total of 730 phylogenetically diverse nod-related sequences recovered from these samples were clustered into 42 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showing a considerably high diversity of nod gene in these different ecosystems. The abundance of nod gene in five environmental samples were ∼1.80 × 107–2.62 × 108 copies g−1 soil (sludge) and ∼9.67 × 106 copies l−1 water. The dominant microorganisms were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. Our results expanded significantly the diversity of microbial groups potentially involved in nitric oxide dismutation, suggesting the ubiquity of microbial members in the different ecosystems carrying out NO dismutation reaction. Further studies on the functional capacity of this new microbial group will advance a better understanding of the microbially-driven nitrogen cycling and provide thorough information on N-removal processes and potential applications. © 2019 The Authors","Distribution; Environmental samples; N-removal; Nitric oxide dismutase","Ecosystems; Microorganisms; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen removal; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Soil pollution; Wastewater treatment; Dismutase; Distribution; Distribution patterns; Environmental sample; N removal; Operational taxonomic units; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment system; Gene encoding; amplification; chemical reaction; enzyme; enzyme activity; gene; gene expression; microbial community; nitric oxide; pollutant removal; polymerase chain reaction; sampling; spatial distribution; wastewater treatment; Actinobacteria; Bacteroidetes; Chloroflexi; Chloroflexi (class); Firmicutes; Otus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066839236

Design/methodology/approach: The present study uses qualitative research using semi-structured interviews with architects, civil engineers, real estate developers and facility managers. Findings: The study found that it is the predominant opinion of respondents that the economic impact of adaptive reuse of old shopping malls in Kosovo is reflected through extension of useful life of the malls, lower cost of reuse vs demolition, economic and tourism development of the neighborhood, job creation and increase of property prices in the surrounding area. In addition, the study found that it is the predominant opinion of respondents that by adaptive reuse of old shopping malls, the revitalization and social dynamism of the surrounding area will be improved and collective memory and identity of these shopping malls will be extended, including the increased traffic, space utilization and security. The study concludes that operational CO2 emission of the old shopping malls will be reduced after their sustainable adaptation and also the embodied energy of the building materials will be reused. Research limitations/implications: The study has several implications. For real estate developers, it shows that is less costly to adapt and refurbish rather than redevelop. For authorities, it shows that by adapting old communist shopping malls, they would extend the collective memory of those locations, improve the social life and utilization of public spaces in the surrounding areas.

We take full advantage of the benefits of new technology, but also clarify that city is not a machine, also cannot fully mechanically control the urban development. This study presents a methodology for identifying low-carbon travel block, which can be used to identify the built environment conducive to residents’ low-carbon travel. We chose the four elements of traffic survey—travel mode, travel time, travel purpose and travel frequency—as the framework to evaluate travel carbon emissions. Using the index data collected from “WeChat,” a popular social-media platform in China and questionnaire surveys, we conducted hotspot analysis of the spatial distribution of travel carbon emissions in GIS. We obtained a comprehensive carbon emissions and its spatial distribution through the superposition of hotspot density surface of different indexes. The results show that E block within the research area has the lowest travel carbon emissions. These results suggest some planning implications from three aspects—land use mode, road network and public service facilities: In the old urban district of Pucheng, the ratio of residential building area and other types’ building area should be “4:1–3:1”; and we should develop the travel model of bicycle, and the interval of bicycle lanes should be 350–450 m; The ratio of walking road to total road area should be 15–20%, and the width of road should be restricted. Coverage of transit site buffered for the radius of 150 m is 40–50%, coverage of shopping services buffered for the radius of 50 m is 45–60%, and coverage of recreational facilities buffered for the radius of 100 m is 50–70%. The results confirm that “functional mixing” and “dense road network” are beneficial to residents’ low-carbon travel proposed by the predecessors. At the same time, we found that not the higher volume rate is, the more favorable for low-carbon travel. Small cities have limited number of population and scattered distribution of professional posts, which are not suitable for the traditional mode of improving the volume ratio and the bus system. It is not that the higher the bus station coverage is, the better for residents to travel as low-carbon, and the high popularity of public transportation in small cities will increase the carbon emission of residents. The study provides a new way to evaluate the carbon emission assessment of blocks and provides a basis for block planning with low-carbon concept. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Block; Built environment; GIS hotspot analysis; Low-carbon travel","Big data; Bus transportation; Geographic information systems; Land use; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Roads and streets; Spatial distribution; Spatial variables measurement; Traffic control; Traffic surveys; Travel time; Urban growth; Zoning; Block; Built environment; Hotspot analysis; Low carbon; Public transportation; Questionnaire surveys; Residential building; Social media platforms; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044788383

However, the voluntary acceptance by landowners crucially depends on their economic outcome. We (i) assess the carbon sequestration potential of afforestation projects in various Chinese regions by comparing different tree species, project durations and regional particularities, (ii) analyze the costs and benefits of tree species used for timber and fruit production as well as bamboo, and (iii) compare them with alternative crops under different climatic and economic conditions. Finally, we calculate the minimum compensation required by farmers to convert cropland to forests assuming a joint production of timber or fruits and carbon sequestration. No compensation is needed when cropland with relatively low revenues is to be converted. In contrast, compensation payments must be high for converting land used for cash crops, such as sugarcane. For fruit trees, the amount of carbon sequestered is low, but selling fruits and nuts is quite profitable. Consequently, in most cases there is no compensation needed. The minimum price per carbon credit decreases with increasing project duration because more carbon is stored per hectare, and in consequence, the required payments per credit are lower. This does not hold for fast-growing trees like eucalyptus and poplar, for which the minimum price increases with extended project duration. Bamboo shows a high carbon sequestration potential, and becomes economically more attractive by including carbon revenues. Carbon credits can often compensate the opportunity costs of alternative land uses, except for afforestation on highly productive cropland. We demonstrate that the economic attractiveness of afforestation projects is strongly context dependent and varies substantially across regions. The findings can contribute to the cost-efficient design of carbon sequestration projects. The methodology can be applied to other regions in the developing world. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon price; Certified Emission Reductions; Grain for Green program; Net present value","Bamboo; Climate change; Crops; Developing countries; Economics; Emission control; Fruits; Land use; Orchards; Reforestation; Timber; Carbon price; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; Certified emission reductions; Compensation payments; Cost-efficient design; Grain for greens; Net present value; Carbon; afforestation; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission control; finance; price dynamics; voluntary approach; Bamboo; Developing Countries; Economics; Farm Crops; Fruits; Land Use; China; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072545410

Findings show that the major retrofit measures include improvement in the building envelope, heating, ventilation and cooling (HVAC) and lighting, supported by photovoltaic (PV) systems, accordingly. Furthermore, the study identifies key elements and plausible challenges for the evaluation of building retrofit measures in this region. In this regard, financial barriers and lack of standards and regulatory support are the main challenges identified. These insights provide a systematic approach to guide building researchers, practitioners and decision-makers in the design and development of existing and new retrofit measures for the future of rapidly growing cities with a broad climate variation scope. © 2019 by the authors.","Building energy consumption; Building retrofit measures; Climate change; Hot-summer–cold-winter; Shanghai","Buildings; Cooling systems; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Energy utilization; Retrofitting; Sustainable development; Building energy consumption; Building energy performance; Building envelopes; Building retrofits; Cold winter; Design and Development; Photovoltaic systems; Shanghai; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072110034

However, as significant climate change is due to market failure, the correction of market failures, by definition, gives rise to the possibility of Pareto improvements. In this paper, we examine the implications of Pareto improvements both within and across generations. We employ the representative consumer model RICE-10 (a global model including different regions) to see how we could potentially distribute any benefits across and within generations such that nobody loses. The model shows that different combinations of present and future consumption along the Pareto-improving frontier yield different combinations of capital investment and emissions. We also calculate a conventional social optimum. While the social optimum, by definition, is on the Pareto efficiency frontier, it is not necessarily on the Pareto-improving segment of this frontier. Total emissions, and hence temperature change, vary significantly across different Pareto-improving scenarios. It obviously matters which generations get the utility gain, and one of our results is that for Pareto improvements where none of the gain goes to the distant future, and allowing transfers, total emissions will be higher than in the social optimum. Even without any welfare gain to the distant future, total emissions may be lower in the Pareto-improving scenarios we have considered than under the social optimum if transfers are not permitted. Moreover, in this case, carbon taxes differ substantially across regions for all Pareto improvements. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate agreements; Intergenerational distribution; Intragenerational distribution; Pareto improvements","Commerce; Investments; Pareto principle; Capital investment; Climate agreement; Future consumption; Intergenerational distribution; Intragenerational distribution; Pareto efficiency; Pareto improvements; Temperature changes; Climate change; atmospheric correction; climate change; future prospect; international agreement; investment; market system; pollution tax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071515374

In 2017, HCMC had 8.6 million inhabitants with a total of nine millions of private vehicles, 19 manufacturing and industrial zones, 30 industrial clusters, and numerous other factories and enterprises. All those sources could contribute to the high levels of emissions which caused the potentially negative impact on human health and environment. The aims of this study were (i) application bottom-up and top-down approaches to conduct a complete air emission inventory, (ii) development of spatial distribution of air emission, and (iii) estimation of emission forecast for HCMC by 2025 and 2030. A combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches was employed to conduct air pollution EI, in which EMISENS model was utilized to generate the EI for road traffic sources. The results showed that the motorcycles were the main reasons of emission in HCMC, contributing 90% of CO, 68% of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), 63% of CH4, 41% of SO2, 29% of NOx, and 18% of patriculate matter (PM2.5). The emission forecasts for HCMC by 2025 and 2030 also were calculated based on the data of strategies and plans for socioeconomic development of HCMC. The results showed that the emissions of pollutants will increase around 30 to 50% by the year 2025 and from 40 to 65% by the year 2030.

The introduction of smart meters into the electrical grid could increase energy efficiency, decrease electrical costs for consumers, and potentially contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the benefits of this technology, smart meters have sparked debate and concern among some energy consumers. In this paper, we examine the publics’ general level of support for smart meter technologies, and a set of variables that may correlate with support for installing smart meters in people's homes. Specifically, we examine whether demographic variables, issues tied to privacy (e.g., privacy concerns and privacy violation), social norms (e.g., injunctive and descriptive norms), and concepts from the technology readiness index (e.g., discomfort with or excitement about new technologies) correlate with support for smart meters. To examine these issues, we analyzed a quota sample of 1035 people living in the U.S. Participants were from 17 states with high rates of smart meter installation. Our results suggest that people's perceptions and experiences with privacy violations are associated with levels of support for smart meter installation for people in our sample.

Participatory deficits are well identified in the Australian literature on the “CSG debate” and subsequently in our analysis of (participatory-associated)policy responses to the CSG debate. Highlighted are concerns around inadequate community engagement involving inequitable power relations between communities and CSG companies, CSG project information deficits and community disrespect, and deficit State CSG regulations. The findings show that policy responses have been more supportive of CSG developers and development than “challenger” issues. Consequently, enduring local social conflict has resulted, and overall, transitions to cleaner energy pathways to meet climate change policy obligations have become “messy”. Overall, CSG development reflects a significantly dysfunctional, “decoupled”, socio-technical energy development system, especially regarding social concerns. Accordingly, participatory remedies are posed on how policymakers can better engage with the concerns of communities and citizens in the broader context of multi-functional and multi-stakeholder energy/landscape conflicts, to better address these conflicts and ensure more effective cleaner energy transitions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Coal seam gas; Community engagement; Energy transitions; Participatory; Social conflict","Climate change; Coal deposits; Australia; Community engagement; Energy transitions; Participatory; Social conflicts; Coal bed methane; climate change; coal seam; energy policy; local participation; power relations; social conflict; Australia; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066272921

In order to reduce noxious emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, governments and the automobile industry have started promoting the adoption of electro mobility (EM) options over the last few years, albeit with limited success in terms of market penetration. This study aimed to improve the current understanding of factors influencing customers' intentions to adopt EM options. Building on the theories of perceived value and reasoned action, this study posits a behavioural model based on four dimensions of perceived value and two technical performance characteristics of EM vehicles with regards to their influence on customer attitudes towards EM options, as a precursor to purchase. The model was tested empirically using structural equation modelling analysis using data gathered through an online survey of 404 consumers in Spain. The results of this study showed that emotional issues, product price, vehicle acceleration and low engine noise levels have a considerable impact on consumer attitudes, which, in turn, have a positive impact on purchase intentions of EM vehicles.

This paper outlines four governance functions for an ideal GST: pacemaker, ensurer of accountability, driver of ambition and provider of guidance and signal. The GST can set the pace of progress by stimulating and synchronizing policy processes across governance levels. It can ensure accountability of Parties through transparency and public information sharing. Ambition can be enhanced through benchmarks for action and transformative learning. By reiterating and refining the long term visions, it can echo and amplify the guidance and signal provided by the Paris Agreement. The paper further outlines preconditions for the effective performance of these functions. Process-related conditions include: a public appraisal of inputs; a facilitative format that can develop specific recommendations; high-level endorsement to amplify the message and effectively inform national climate policy agendas; and an appropriate schedule, especially with respect to the transparency framework. Underlying information provided by Parties complemented with other (scientific) sources needs to enable benchmark setting for collective climate action, to allow for transparent assessments of the state of emissions and progress of a low-carbon transformation. The information also needs to be politically relevant and concrete enough to trigger enhancement of ambition. We conclude that meeting these conditions would enable an ideal GST and maximize its catalytic effect. Key policy insights The functional argument developed in this article may inspire a purposeful design of the GST as its modalities and procedures are currently being negotiated. The analytical framework provided serves as a benchmark against which to assess the GST's modalities and procedures. Gaps and blind spots in the official GST can and should be addressed by processes external to the climate regime in academia and civil society. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Adopting a strategy of restraint appeared optimal not because of a pervasive disinterest in or ignorance of the potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change. Rather, this administrative decision was rooted in widespread skepticism of the public's ability to regulate their panic given popular dissemination of alarming scenarios of the future. Their concerns were not epistemic; they were sociopolitical. Broad-based appeals to moderation directly informed both scientists and the administration's eventual decision in 1980 to minimize executive involvement. Despite some environmentalists' and scientists' calls for a more proactive position aligned with their ethical perspectives about the future implications of climate change, these linguistic cues of moderation became powerful heuristics that helped shape and anchor assessments of climate risk, calibrate scientists' advice to policy makers, and regulate public apprehension about climate risk. Ultimately, officials within and outside the science community concluded that the likely short-term costs incurred from immediate action to curb fossil fuel emissions were greater than the social and political costs incurred from maintaining what was considered to be a tempered approach to climate governance in the near-term. © 2019 by the Regents of the University of California.","Carbon dioxide; Carter Administration; Climate governance; Environmental; Heuristic; Science advising",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077236090

We analyzed the potential effects of climate change on 200 plant species in Puerto Rico under two emission scenarios and in four periods over the twenty-first century. Our approach was based on ensemble bioclimatic modeling using eight modeling algorithms and community richness analysis. Our findings showed that the probabilities of environmental suitability decline for wet climate species and increase for drier and warm climate species in the future periods under both emission scenarios, with stronger effects under the higher emission scenario. Expansion of dry climate species to higher elevations appears to be a prominent response of species to climatic change in the island based on changes in environmental suitability but the actual species redistribution will be influenced by their life histories, potential adaptation, dispersal abilities, species introductions, and species interactions. This potential movement leads to a spatial pattern of species richness at site level that shows a positive relationship with elevation, which becomes stronger in the later periods of the century. The spatial pattern of species richness, if combined with single species projections, can provide critical information for conservation management in the island. Conservation management can support island-wide biological diversity by protecting the wet climate species on the uplands. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Conservation; Bioclimatic models; Climatic changes; Conservation management; Emission scenario; Plant species richness; Potential effects; Species interactions; Species introductions; Climate change; algorithm; bioclimatology; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; conservation management; dispersal; plant community; species richness; twenty first century; upland region; Puerto Rico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071602231

Typically, research on energy renovation measures to decrease this consumption use current (or similar) energy system data for emission estimates. This approach undervalues the dynamic nature of energy production technologies, given the lifetime of the renovation investments. Especially in Finland, the dynamic is strong: District heating (DH) is common, and largely supplied by combined heat and power. Due to this electricity-DH connection, electricity and DH consumption profiles of buildings have a large potential to affect the technologies used for energy production, as well as the emissions released.

We generally know more about past effects than potential future impacts, and direct influences such as changes of habitat footprints than indirect, long-term responses in behavior, distribution, or abundance. Yet, an understanding of all these components is needed to plan for future landscapes that include human activities and wildlife. We developed a case study to assess how spatially explicit individual-based modeling could be used to evaluate future population outcomes of gradual landscape change from multiple stressors. For Greater Sage-grouse in southwest Wyoming, USA, we projected oil and gas development footprints and climate-induced vegetation changes 50 years into the future. Using a time-series of planned oil and gas development and predicted climate-induced changes in vegetation, we recalculated habitat selection maps to dynamically modify future habitat quantity, quality, and configuration. We simulated long-term Sage-grouse responses to habitat change by allowing individuals to adjust to shifts in habitat availability and quality. The use of spatially explicit individual-based modeling offered a useful means of evaluating delayed indirect impacts of landscape change on wildlife population outcomes. The inclusion of movement and demographic responses to oil and gas infrastructure resulted in substantive changes in distribution and abundance when cumulated over several decades and throughout the regional population. When combined, additive development and climate-induced vegetation changes reduced abundance by up to half of the original size. In our example, the consideration of only a single population stressor the final possible population size by as much as 50%. Multiple stressors and their cumulative impacts need to be broadly considered through space and time to avoid underestimating the impacts of multiple gradual changes and overestimating the ability of populations to withstand change. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.

One of the key sectors in finding solutions to climate change is the built environment, which currently directly or indirectly causes the majority of anthropogenic GHG emissions. The transition towards more sustainable settlements requires massive use of materials and energy, but it is not well known at all how much GHG emissions are ""invested"" into the development of the future low-carbon built environment. In this study we use input-output analysis to calculate an estimate of the GHGs embodied in the built environment development in Iceland. The input data consists of annual economic turnover data of different construction sectors for the years 2013-2017. The GHG estimates are derived using the EIO-LCA input-output model. We find that the built environment development emissions of Iceland are significant even though the actual emissions largely take place outside the country, being thus outsourced emissions.

The goal of this study was to analyse the environmental impact of applying a sol-gel coating on hemp shiv, in order to improve the durability of this innovative bio-based material, using a regionalised LCA model, taking into account regional specific peculiarities. This study analysed the environmental performance of using bio-based materials in the building envelope compared with traditional synthetic construction materials, and compared the impact of a regionalised approach with a global approach. The carbon footprint of treated hemp shiv in a wall with a U-value of 0.15W/m2.K was compared to untreated hempcrete and a reference cavity wall with the same U-value. Considering the environmental damage caused by the production of hemp shiv, nitrogen fertiliser was the hotspot. The LCA results showed that, using innovative bio-based materials in construction, treated hemp shiv with sol-gel can decrease the carbon footprint of a building envelope through carbon sequestration.

Its degradation is critical for litter decomposition and the formation of soil organic matter. However, little is known about lignin degradation dynamics and its controlling factors during leaf litter decomposition, especially in forest ecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate lignin degradation dynamics during litter decomposition and its controlling factors. Methods: We conducted a lab incubation experiment for 180 days with leaves of two tree species (Fagus lucida and Schima parviflora) from a mid-subtropical forest in China. The CuO oxidation method was applied for lignin determination. The mass loss of bulk litter and lignin (including V-, S- and C-type phenols) and the dynamics of litter microbial community composition, carbon, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were determined during the incubation. Results: Lignin degradation appeared to be a two-phase process over the incubation period, including a fast decomposition phase (early stage) followed by a relatively slow decomposition phase (late stage). Additionally, 21.9% and 18.5% of the initial lignin contents were lost from F. lucida and S. parviflora litter, respectively. The acid to aldehyde ratios of V-type phenols [(Ac/Al)V] and S-type phenols [(Ac/Al)S] of both litters increased with incubation. Lignin degradation was significantly affected by the litter types but not by the soil microbial communities, given that the soil microbial communities were distinctly different for the two plant communities. In the early stage, the mass loss of lignin from the F. lucida litter was faster than the S. parviflora litter: the mass loss of S-type phenols from the F. lucida litter was faster than the S. parviflora litter, whereas the dynamics of the V-type phenols were comparable for the two species. For F. lucida litter, lignin was lost faster than the bulk litter in the early stage but no difference was observed after day 133. For S. parviflora litter, the degradation of lignin and bulk litter were generally comparable over the incubation period. The mass loss of lignin in the early stage was significantly correlated with lignin, N and P contents, and the carbon/N, carbon/P and N/P ratios. Among these factors, P played a prominent role in controlling lignin degradation. Conclusions: The important role of litter chemistry emphasized the importance of taking this into account in plant-soil models assessing carbon dynamics in forest ecosystems. These results improve our conceptual understanding of lignin degradation and its controlling factors. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CuO oxidation; Lignin degradation; Litter type; Microbial community; Subtropical forest","biodegradation; chemistry; community composition; decomposition; leaf litter; lignin; microbial activity; microbial community; plant community; soil organic matter; soil-vegetation interaction; subtropical region; tree; tropical forest; Fagus lucida; Schima",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069164281

However, empirical analyses on how urban form improves or degrades urban air quality are still limited and inconclusive, especially for those rapidly expanding cities in developing countries. In this study, by using the improved STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology) model, the quantitative impact of urban form on near-surface PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations was identified in the 10 prefecture-level cities of the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) from 2000 to 2013. Trend analyses showed a significant increasing trend in both PM2.5 (9.69 × 10−4 µg·m−3·year−1) and NO2 (1.73 × 10−4 ppb·year−1) for the whole study period. Notably, a turning point of PM2.5 from increasing to decreasing trends occurred around 2007. In addition, both pollutants showed a spatial agglomeration. The STIRPAT model demonstrated that socioeconomic, transportation and urban form factors played an important role in alleviating the increase of PM2.5 and NO2. In particular, a 1% decrease in urban extent density (UED) significantly increased NO2 by 0.203%, but reduced PM2.5 by 0.033%. The proximity index (PI) measured as a city’s compactness was significantly negatively correlated with PM2.5 and NO2. Conversely, a significant positive relationship of PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations against the openness index (OI) was observed, an important variable for measuring a city’s fragmentation. In addition, the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis between per capita GDP and PM2.5 concentration was confirmed but failed in NO2. Overall, this study encouraged a less fragmented and more compact urban form, which helped alleviate local air pollution concentrations by enhancing urban connectivity, reducing vehicle dependence, and facilitating the use of bicycles and walking. © 2019 by the authors.

About 90% of global cases were reported in China. We collected monthly data on counts of HFRS cases, climatic factors (mean temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity), and vegetation (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) in 109 Chinese counties from January 2002 to December 2013. First, we used a quasi-Poisson regression with a distributed lag non-linear model to assess the impacts of these four factors on HFRS in 109 counties, separately. Then we conducted a multivariate meta-analysis to pool the results at the national level. The results of our study showed that there were non-linear associations between the four factors and HFRS. Specifically, the highest risks of HFRS occurred at the 45th, 30th, 20th, and 80th percentiles (with mean and standard deviations of 10.58 ± 4.52◦ C, 18.81 ± 17.82 mm, 58.61 ± 6.33%, 198.20 ± 22.23 at the 109 counties, respectively) of mean temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and NDVI, respectively. HFRS case estimates were most sensitive to mean temperature amongst the four factors, and the lag patterns of the impacts of these factors on HFRS were heterogeneous. Our findings provide rigorous scientific support to current HFRS monitoring and the development of early warning systems. © 2019 by the authors.

Due to climate change, rainfall extremes are subject to changes, it is, therefore, crucial to explore the potential impacts these changes will have on design storms. A new strain of methodologies, quantile-based downscaling approaches, have recently been proposed to exclusively downscale extreme rainfall quantiles obtained from Global Climate Models (GCMs). These approaches, however, have not been systematically intercompared and the uncertainties related to assigning future design storms are poorly understood. This study evaluates the functionality of three quantile-based downscaling methods during the historical and future periods in Montreal, Canada. Results show that the performance of quantile-based downscaling approaches in reproducing observed extreme quantiles can be divergent. At lower return periods, however, differences between the three schemes are not significant. Similar performances for reproducing historical rainfall extremes, however, does not necessarily imply similar future projections due to the different functionalities of the three approaches in mapping GCM projections into finer scales. Despite these uncertainties, the total projection range of future rainfall extremes are, in many cases, comparable to the confidence interval of the parametric probability distribution when fitted to the observed annual maximum rainfall series. A risk-based approach to accommodate this uncertainty in vulnerability assessments through evaluating potential alterations in historical rainfall extremes using an ensemble projection coming from multiple downscaling approaches is suggested. This allows for the selection of design storms based on the acceptable level of risk and given budgetary and operational restrictions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Benchmarking; Climate change; Design storms; Extreme rainfall quantiles; Intensity–Duration–Frequency (IDF) curves; Quantile-based downscaling","Benchmarking; Budget control; Climate models; Probability distributions; Rain; Storms; Annual maximum rainfalls; Design storms; Down-scaling; Extreme rainfall; Infrastructure design; Intensity-duration-frequency curves; Risk based approaches; Vulnerability assessments; Climate change; benchmarking; climate change; downscaling; extreme event; precipitation intensity; storm; uncertainty analysis; Canada; Montreal; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068716593

By inducing land-use changes within forestry, climate adaptation and mitigation policy can alter the flow of nonmar-ket forest ecosystem services. The purpose of this paper is to quantify the effect of climate change and carbon pricing on adaptation behavior of private forest owners. We develop an empirical framework with application to the US Pacific coast. An estimated discrete-choice econometric model is used as the empirical basis for a simulation of land-use changes to the composition of a landscape’s forest stock. Results indicate that climate change induces landowners to adapt away from their current dominant species choice of Douglas-fir to species more suitable for the future climate, notably hardwoods and ponderosa pine. A carbon price policy accelerates adaptation away from current forest types, potentially creating an externality at the local level. © 2019 by The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.

Here we use evidence from landscapes which are known to be environmentally sensitive to show that geomorphological change in response to shifts in climate can be highly nonlinear. Our study sites are two mountain massifs on the western coast of Ireland. Both sites have similar geological and Pleistocene glacial histories and are similar topographically, geomorphologically and in their climate histories. We show that despite these similarities their response to late Holocene, climate change has differed. Both massifs have responded to short-term climate changes over the last 4500 years that are considered to have been uniform across the region, but these climate changes have resulted in highly differentiated and nonlinear landscape responses. We argue this reflects nonlinearity in the forcing–response processes at such scales and suggests that current approaches to modelling the response of such systems to future climate change using numerical climate models may not accurately capture the landscape response. We end by discussing some of the implications for obtaining decision-relevant predictions of landscape responses to climatic forcing and for climate change adaptation and planning, using regional climate models. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Climate models; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change adaptation; Environmentally sensitive; Geomorphological change; Pleistocene glacial; Regional climate models; Response process; Short-term climate changes; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; cultural landscape; geomorphology; Holocene; landscape; Pleistocene; regional climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071569449

It depends on the catalysis from platinum-group metals, the rarest metals on Earth. However, due to the limited reserve, it is critical to evaluate whether global platinum resources can meet the increasing demand. This paper aims to account whether current platinum resources can support future fuel cell vehicle deployment for 140 countries for the period 2000–2100 by establishing a technology-rich, bottom-up model. It is found that, under a wide range of scenarios, the primary resource demand is significantly lower than the supply capacity at the global level. This result confirms that fuel cell vehicles have the potential to significantly contribute to global decarbonization strategies. However, challenges exist at regional and national levels. Most regions will rely heavily on resource import from the few countries with substantial resource endowments but with political instability, implying potential supply risks. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","fuel cell vehicle; low-carbon transition; platinum-group metals; resource sustainability","fuel cell; model; platinum group element; resource management; sustainability; transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075653743

Screen printing method was used to prepare thick films of five different weight percent of copper oxide. XRD confirmed that material consists pure alpha phase of ortho-rhombic molybdenum trioxide (JCPDS 21-0569). FE-SEM micrographs showed plank-like structure having all three dimension in microns. Hence authors used term micro-planks. EDS analysis showed that all sample were having excess oxygen. Electrical measurement showed n-type semiconductor behavior of films. TCR also showed negative values for all films. Resistivity of the films reduced from 80 Ω m to 25 Ω m as copper oxide percentage increased. Activation energy in high temperature region also decreased from 0.6 eV to 0.25 eV due to addition of copper oxide dopant. 9 Wt% copper added molybdenum trioxide films (Cu9) showed 74.87% response to carbon monoxide gas at 150 °C. Response time (80 s) and recovery time (110 s) was quick. The synergy between thermal energy, oxygen excess samples, the activity of micro-planks and catalytic property of copper oxide dopant accelerated the reduction of carbon monoxide. Hence selectivity to carbon monoxide gas as compared with NH3, NO2, Ethanol vapor and LPG improved due to copper oxide dopant. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Carbon monoxide; Copper; Micro-planks; Molybdenum trioxide; Surface oxygen hopping","Activation energy; Ammonia; Carbon films; Carbon monoxide; Copper; Copper oxides; Gas detectors; Gas sensing electrodes; Liquefied petroleum gas; Nanobelts; Oxide films; Oxygen; Screen printing; Thick films; Carbon monoxide gas sensors; Electrical measurement; Gas sensing properties; Micro-planks; Molybdenum trioxide; N-type semiconductors; Screen printing methods; Surface oxygen; Molybdenum oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072709099

One important goal of the City of Gothenburg is to be a climate neutral city with fair emission levels of greenhouse gases in 2030. In order to reach this goal, a demonstration project has been initiated with the aim to build a fossil free preschool - Hoppet. Hoppet will be built with a minimal climate impact and with no fossil resources. This includes everything from production and transport of materials to energy usage in the building. The fossil content and the climate impact of a standard preschool has been calculated, to be used as a benchmark for Hoppet. The result shows that all 250 building products in the reference preschool have a climate impact but finding fossil free and climate neutral alternative products has been found challenging. The climate impact of the building products in the reference preschool is calculated to more than 220 kg CO2-eq. per m2. Strategies to decrease climate impact for Hoppet preschool has been developed. For example, product development and innovation has been identified as key issues as well as increased collaboration between different actors in the construction industry. Communicating the project internationally is of high importance to find partners and innovations that don't exist in Sweden as well as to engage other stakeholders to help transform the building sector. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The results do not support the convergence of full sample or similar environmental quality; instead, we find two different steady-state (or club convergence) equilibriums for PCEF and PCCF. Further, our results show that countries which have the lowest PCEF and PCCF are converging (growing) faster than those countries which have the highest PCEF and PCCF. Finally, the speed of convergence of PCEF for club 1 is noted at around 0.126% while for club 2, it is 0.165%. Hence, the climate change policies need to be designed by following the club convergence of the sample countries.

In our analysis, we incorporate direct measures of fossil fuel use in a manner that allows us to distinguish carbon emissions from consumption-based and production-based activities. Focusing on the 36 most populous and urbanized counties within the state of California, we merge these emissions, along with other political and economic measures, with an indicator of extensive policy support derived from climate agreement signatories. We then use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to examine conditions that are sufficient for broad adoption of climate policy within a given county. Based on the results, we frame consumption-based and production-based emissions as distinctive in the way that their relationship with climate policy adoption depends on other favorable political and economic conditions. In particular, we identify several routes to extensive adoption for counties that have a combination of low emissions and a favorable political environment. In the conclusion, we discuss the QCA findings and elaborate on the theoretical and practical implications for efforts to understand and to promote carbon reduction efforts at the local level. © 2019, AESS.","Carbon emissions and affluence; Civic capacity and emissions; Direct measures of carbon emissions; Fuzzy-set; Local climate change policy; Policy adoption; Production and consumption carbon emissions; Qualitative comparative analysis","carbon emission; climate change; comparative study; environmental policy; fossil fuel; fuzzy mathematics; local government; qualitative analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070225719

This research work focused on life cycle analysis of HCNG® heavy-duty vehicle in which 20% gaseous hydrogen blended with compressed natural gas has been investigated in terms of net energy ratio, GHG value, and cost-effectiveness over a scale of 'per MJ energy output' in two fuel options, i.e. 0%HCNG and 20%HCNG for an entire well-to-wheel cycle. An engineering economic approach has been used to evaluate cost-effectiveness ratio of CNG and 20%HCNG pathways derived from fuel economy improvement. It has been shown that at pump-to-wheel stage, 7% reduction in fuel consumption can be achieved together with 11% reduction in GHGs, 7% reduction in energy consumption at operation and 7% reduction in total costs (RMB/MJ) for 20%HCNG compared with CNG. Rank (1 means 'best and 10 means 'worst') showed that renewable-based hydrogen pathways such as solar, wind and biomass showed dual benefits of lower energy consumption and lower GHG emissions whereas grid electricity-to-hydrogen displayed the worst case in both scenarios. Usually, biomass-based HCNG pathways may have higher net energy ratio, but the sources are cleaner, and renewable in nature. The energy efficiency of fossil-based pathways such as natural gas, coal, etc., is higher than biomass gasification pathway. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

In order to analyze the impacts of financial development on CO2 emissions under different levels of financial development, full-sample panels and sub-panels were estimated. The estimation results show that financial development efficiency and stock trading volume have positive impacts on CO2 emissions, while financial development scale and the market value of listed companies have negative impacts on CO2 emissions. The elasticity coefficients of the financial development variables are different for different sub-panels with different financial development. In addition, we do robustness tests by estimating the panel data model of four different sub-panels, which estimation results are consistent with the previous regression results. Finally, we suggest China's policy makers the following policy implications: China's government should formulate and improve financial credit policies, which can encourage financial institutions to carry out green credit business. Laws and regulations of stock markets should match the environmental protection and carbon emission reduction. China's government should formulate and implement fiscal and taxation policies to encourage enterprises to prevent high energy consumption and carbon emission, especially non-stated owned enterprises and small size enterprises. Moreover, China should gradually develop the domestic carbon finance market and carbon trading market, which can promote carbon emission reduction and doesn't require additional subsidy from the government. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","China; CO2 emissions; Financial development; Panel data analysis; STIRPAT model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068022460

At the same time, the imposition of more stringent emission regulations in the transport sector, is a crucial aspect to be taken into account during the development of future gas engines. Aim of the present paper was to characterize a heavy duty spark ignition engine, under development for Euro VI compliance, with a particular focus on exhaust particulate emissions. In this sense, the engine was installed on a dynamic test bench, accurately instrumented to analyze combustion evolution, performance and exhaust pollutant emissions, along the World Harmonized Transient Cycle (WHTC). The emissions diagnostic devices included a gas analysis system for the measurement of regulated species, a photo-acoustic sensor and a fast particulate spectrometer for on-line soot, particle number (PN) and particle size measurements, during the transient engine tests. The system layout comprised also a Thermodenuder to provide information on the volatile species contribution to particles emissions. The results reveal a correlation of soot and PN emissions with some specific phases of the test cycle, providing some clues on the source of particles emissions. The paper improves the literature in this field, at present still limited, providing useful information on soot and PN emissions from a heavy duty gas engine at the state of art technology. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

Four multilateral funds have been created under the climate change regime in order to support developing countries’ adaptation. These funds finance a number of projects mostly or partly related to marine and coastal fisheries. They include measures of a structural nature meant to modify laws, policies or strategies and to improve one's understanding of climate change impacts on fisheries; measures to improve fish stocks’ resilience to climate change, by reducing harvesting and ecosystem-related stressors; and measures to improve fishing communities’ resilience in terms of food security and livelihoods. A majority of the marine fisheries projects focuses on the countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on marine fisheries. However, many vulnerable countries still do not receive financial support for adaptation in the marine fisheries sector. The four multilateral funds operate with insufficient and unequal levels of transparency regarding several stages of projects’ cycles; this raises issues of efficiency and accountability.

We examined the case of a climatically limited edge-of-range population of a medium-sized grassland bird, for which climate responses may involve a behavioural trade-off between temperature stress and reproduction. We hypothesised that temperature will be a limiting factor for the conspicuous, male snort-call display behaviour, and high temperatures would reduce the display activity of male birds. Using remote tracking technology with tri-axial accelerometers we classified and studied the display behaviour of 17 free-ranging male little bustards, Tetrax tetrax, at 5 sites in the Iberian Peninsula. Display behaviour was related to temperature using two classes of Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) at different temporal resolutions. GAMMs showed that temperature, time of the day and Julian date explained variation in display behaviour within the day, with birds snort-calling significantly less during higher temperatures. We also showed that variation in daily snort-call activity was related to average daytime temperatures, with our model predicting an average decrease in daytime snort-call display activity of up to 10.4% for the temperature increases projected by 2100 in this region due to global warming. For lekking birds and mammals undertaking energetically-costly displays in a warming climate, reduced display behaviour could impact inter- and intra-sex mating behaviour interactions through sexual selection and mate choice mechanisms, with possible consequences on mating and reproductive success. The study provides a reproducible example for how accelerometer data can be used to answer research questions with important conservation inferences related to the impacts of climate change on a range of taxonomic groups. © 2019 Gudka et al.

Sea ice models governed by physical equations have been used to simulate the state of the ice including characteristics such as ice thickness, concentration, and motion. More recent models also attempt to capture features such as fractures or leads in the ice. These simulated features can be partially misaligned or misshapen when compared to observational data, whether due to numerical approximation or incomplete physics. In order to make realistic forecasts and improve understanding of the underlying processes, it is necessary to calibrate the numerical model to field data. Traditional calibration methods based on generalized least-square metrics are flawed for linear features such as sea ice cracks. We develop a statistical emulation and calibration framework that accounts for feature misalignment and misshapenness, which involves optimally aligning model output with observed features using cutting-edge image registration techniques. This work can also have application to other physical models which produce coherent structures.

Maritime transportation, which carries more than 90% of the global trade, plays a critical role in the contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the GHGs emitted by the global fleet still fall outside the emission reduction scheme established by the Kyoto Protocol. Alternative solutions are therefore sought. Several market-based measures have been proposed and submitted to IMO for discussion and evaluation. In this paper, we focus on one of these measures, namely the Maritime Emissions Trading Scheme (METS). An optimization model that integrates (global or regional) METS into the classical fleet composition and deployment problem is proposed. This model is used as a tool to study the impact of METS on fleet operations and their CO2 emissions. The results of the computational study suggest that, in the short term, the implementation of METS does not lead to emission reduction in most scenarios. However, in the case of low bunker prices, high allowance costs or global METS coverage, a more significant CO2 decrease in the short term can be expected. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emission reduction; Fleet composition and deployment; Greenhouse gas; Maritime Emissions Trading Scheme; Market-based measures","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Costs; Emission control; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Global warming; International law; Waterway transportation; Alternative solutions; Emission reduction; Emission trading scheme; Emissions Trading Scheme; Fleet composition; Maritime transportation; Market-based measures; Optimization modeling; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; maritime transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070873057

By definition, the SC-CO2 is a measure, in dollars, of the long-term damage resulting from the emission of a metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). Therefore, this dollar figure also represents the value of damages avoided due to an equivalent reduction or sequestration of CO2. The objective of this study was to assess the value of SIC stocks in the contiguous United States (U.S.) by soil order, soil depth (0-20, 20-100, 100-200 cm), land resource region (LRR), state, and region using information from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database together with a reported SC-CO2 of $42 (U.S. dollars).With this approach, the calculated monetary value for total SIC storage in the contiguous U.S. was between $3.48T (i.e., $3.48 trillion U.S. dollars, where T = trillion = 1012) and $14.4T, with a midpoint value of $8.34T. Soil orders with the highest (midpoint) values for SIC storage were: 1) Mollisols ($3.57T), 2) Aridisols ($1.99T), and 3) Alfisols ($841B) (i.e., $841B is 841 billion U.S. dollars, where B = billion = 109). When normalized by land area, the soil orders with the highest (midpoint) values for SIC storage were: 1) Vertisols ($3.57 m-2), 2) Aridisols ($2.45 m-2), and 3) Mollisols ($1.77 m-2). Most of the SIC value was associated with the 100-200 cm depth interval, with a midpoint value of $4T and an area-normalized value of $0.54 m-2. The LRRs with the highest (midpoint) values of SIC storage were: 1) D-Western Range and Irrigated Region ($1.77T), 2) H-Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region ($1.49T), and 3) M-Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region ($1.02T). When normalized by land area, the LRRs were ranked: 1) I-Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region ($5.36 m-2), 2) J-Southwestern Prairies Cotton and Forage Region ($4.56 m-2), and 3) H-Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region ($2.56 m-2). States with the highest (midpoint) values for SIC storage were: 1) Texas ($2.96T), 2) New Mexico ($572B), and 3) Montana ($524B). When normalized by land area, the states were ranked: 1) Texas ($4.47 m-2), 2) Utah ($2.77 m-2), and 3) Minnesota ($2.17 m-2). Lastly, regions with the highest (midpoint) values for SIC storage were: 1) South Central ($3.13T), 2) West ($1.98T), and 3) Northern Plains ($1.62T). When normalized by land area, the regions were ranked: 1) South Central ($2.90 m-2), 2) Midwest ($1.32 m-2), and 3) West ($1.02 m-2).

The composition of diesel exhaust and its concentrations in air has changed significantly over time, to the extent that now there is a distinction between “traditional” and “new technology” diesel emissions. New technology diesel engines comply with emissions from EURO 3 vehicles and higher. Starting with EURO 5, a significant further reduction of particle emissions has been achieved by increased temperature, which, however, lead to increased emissions of NOx and exceeded the NO2 emission limit. To overcome this problem, some car manufacturers installed illegal software that detected the vehicle test bench operation, resulting in low emissions during the test cycle. Detection of such devices in 2015 led to the “Diesel scandal”. In 2017 the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedure (WLTP) was introduced for new cars, which simulates emissions under different driving conditions. It became mandatory for certification of all new vehicles by September 2018. In addition, fleet CO2 emissions have been introduced for all cars, requiring that by 2020 95% of each manufacturer’s passenger car must meet the CO2 emission target of 95 mg/km, and by 2021 100% of the fleet. All these regulations significantly reduced the emissions of diesel- and gasoline-driven cars, which since the introduction of the EURO 6 regulation in 2014 are almost similar for both. Since the energy efficiency of diesel motors is up to 20% higher than that of gasoline-driven cars resulting in up to 20% lower CO2 emission, there is no reason to question the future use of diesel engines. These regulations apply for new cars. However, air concentrations at sampling points close to streets with high traffic still exceed the limit values especially for NO2. In several cities this led to restrictions for passenger cars of EURO 5 and below. Since concentrations close to streets are not relevant to evaluate the long-term exposure of the population, these measures are highly debatable. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Diesel engine emissions; Efficiency of Diesel engines; Limit values; Modern Diesel technology; Toxicological evaluations of emissions","carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; diesel fuel; gasoline; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; organic compound; sulfur dioxide; air pollution control; car; comparative study; controlled study; diesel engine; ecotoxicology; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; human; long term exposure; particle size; priority journal; Review; traffic; water vapor; air pollutant; air pollution; car driving; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; prevention and control; procedures; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Automobile Driving; Automobiles; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070893536

In 2016, total CO2 emissions of the industrial fishing sector were 159 million tonnes compared to 39 million tonnes in 1950. In contrast, the small-scale fishing sector emitted 48 million tonnes in 2016, compared to only 8 million tonnes in1950. Industrial CO2 emissions intensity was estimated to be 2.0 tCO2∙tcatch−1 in 2016 compared to 1.8 tCO2∙tcatch−1 for the small-scale sector in the same year. A previous study, using different methods, estimated global CO2 emissions from fishing to be 112 million tonnes in 2011. Geographical comparisons suggest that the differences between global estimates are explained by regional variation in fuel use intensity and the inclusion of unreported catch and effort data in our estimate. Supplementing fuel use intensity data for one region to that of another with considerably different fisheries may result in misrepresenting fuel use intensity and subsequently CO2 emissions.

However, it is a challenge to integrate climate change information in a form that can be used efficiently by adaptation planners, policy makers, and fishery managers. In this study, we frame a climate change impact assessment using a geographical perspective based on the management units of the dominant fishery, in this case, American lobster in Nova Scotia, Canada. The information considered here includes economic dependence on the fishery, population size, diversity of the fishery revenue, status of harbor infrastructure, total replacement cost of each harbor, increased relative sea level and flooding, and the vulnerability of offshore lobster to ocean warming and changes in zooplankton composition and anticipatory changes in fishery productivity across management borders. Using two ocean models to provide multi-decadal scale projections of bottom temperature, changes in offshore lobster distribution are projected to have a neutral, or positive impact on the region as a whole. However, when lobster vulnerability is combined with climate change related vulnerabilities of coastal fishing communities, it is evident that adaptation planning is needed for long-term sustainability. This impact assessment provides both a framework and information for further in-depth analyses by climate change adaptation planners and fishery managers. © Copyright © 2019 Greenan, Shackell, Ferguson, Greyson, Cogswell, Brickman, Wang, Cook, Brennan and Saba.","climate change; climate projections; coastal vulnerability; fishery management; harbor infrastructure; lobster; thermal habitat",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072887581

As dicamba-based herbicide usage increased, reports of non-target crop damage dramatically increased. Temperature inversions have been implicated in this off-target damage. Short-term climatologies of surface inversions at six locations across the soybeanand cotton-growing regions of the US were developed for the period 15 May through 30 June between 2012 and 2017 using National Climate Reference Network measurements. Inversions occurred most nights, occasionally collapsing and then reforming in the same night. Inversions often formed before or around sunset as the surface temperature cooled more rapidly than the overlying air. Inversion development was similar for most of the soybean-growing region with the greatest change in temperature difference between the air and the ground occurring at sundown. Higher wind speeds corresponded to decreased inversion intensity and shortened the duration of the inversion. Differences in inversion conditions in 2017 versus those of 2013-2016 were not consistent; consequently, the increased occurrence of off-target damage by dicamba in 2017 cannot be explained by an increase in the number or intensity of inversions or differences in winds during inversions. The presence of inversions when they are not expected (before sunset, after sunrise and when winds exceed 3 mph) increases the risk of unexpected off-target crop damage. Since inversions are commonly a local phenomenon, predicting inversion occurrence requires understanding the conditions at specific locations. © 2019 The author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071915040

Numerous management strategies and regulations have been developed to monitor and reduce population declines. In Puerto Rico, an administrative order of 1999, regulates a closed season, prohibited the capture of crabs through the year from NPA’s and below a minimum size for capture (64 mm). The goal of this research was to monitor spatial-temporal dynamics of crab captures after the implementation of the administrative order. Crabs captured in the Jobos Bay Estuary (JBE) were studied over a 15-year period. The size (carapace width) (CW), sex, and color were documented for 1 531 crabs from 31 crab hunters. Significant temporal difference in crab size was observed (Kruskal Wallis = 46.82, P &lt; 6.187e-9), the smallest crabs were captured in 2004 and the largest crabs were captured in 2013. Crab size varied by color (Kruskal Wallis = 86.54, P &lt; 2.2e-16), larger crabs were blue, medium sized crabs were brown and smallest crabs were orange. Since color is related to development stage and market value, color can be used as an educational and enforcement tool. There was significant spatial difference in the size of crabs captured (Kruskal Wallis = 252.54, P &lt; 2.2e-16), smaller crabs were captured in smaller hunting areas. Only three percent of crabs captured from 2009 to 2018 were below the legal-size limit. Temperature had a weak significant positive relationship with crab size and in years when rainfall was lower smaller crabs were captured. Increases in crab size from 2004 to 2013 coincided with mangrove recovery and the current decrease of crab size coincides with droughts of 2015. Management plans in the Caribbean must include local actions to reduce hunting and climate variability impacts on crab habitat and food availability. © 2019, Universidad de Costa Rica.

Energy performance certificates (EPCs) were implemented as one of the tools to promote this agenda, and are used for the energy performance assessment of buildings. In this study, the characteristics of the Portuguese dwelling stock are regionally analysed using data from approximately 523,000 Portuguese residential EPCs. Furthermore, a bottom-up building typology approach is used to assess the regional energy needs impact of retrofitting actions and to estimate the heating and cooling energy performance gaps of the whole dwelling stock, as well as the potential CO2 emissions resulting from the gaps' potential offset due to increase thermal comfort. The results show that Portuguese residential buildings have very low energy performance, with windows and roofs being identified as the most energy inefficient elements. Roof retrofitting has the highest potential for the reduction of energy needs. The estimated heating and cooling energy performance gap amount to very significant percentages, due to the poor performing building stock but also very low energy consumption levels, with probable consequences for the thermal comfort of occupants. Assuming the current energy mix, carbon emissions would be 9.8 and 20.2 times higher associated with heating and cooling, respectively, if the actual final energy consumption were to match the estimated theoretical values derived from building regulation. This study demonstrates several application cases and leverages the potential of the individual EPC, increasing the detail in the dwelling stock characterization and energy performance estimation, revealing its value for energy retrofit and climate change mitigation assessments, as well as establishing the ground for future work related to building retrofits, energy efficiency measure implementation, climate change mitigation, thermal comfort, and energy poverty studies. © 2019 The Author(s).

Here, we compile 55 published model studies (consisting of 778 individual simulations) that assess the impact of six forcing mechanisms on millennial-scale CO2,atm variations: changes in freshwater supply to the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean, the strength and position of the southern-hemisphere westerlies, Antarctic sea ice extent, and aeolian dust fluxes. We generally find agreement on the direction of simulated CO2,atm change across simulations, but the amplitude of change is inconsistent, primarily due to the different complexities of the model representation of Earth system processes. When freshwater is added to the North Atlantic, a reduced Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is generally accompanied by an increase in Southern Ocean- and Pacific overturning, reduced Antarctic sea ice extent, spatially varying export production, and changes in carbon storage in the Atlantic (rising), in other ocean basins (generally decreasing) and on land (more varied). Positive or negative CO2,atm changes are simulated during AMOC minima due to a spatially and temporally varying dominance of individual terrestrial and oceanic drivers (and compensating effects between them) across the different models. In contrast, AMOC recoveries are often accompanied by rising CO2,atm levels, which are mostly driven by ocean carbon release (albeit from different regions). The magnitude of simulated CO2,atm rise broadly scales with the duration of the AMOC perturbation (i.e., the stadial length). When freshwater is added to the Southern Ocean, reduced deep-ocean ventilation drives a CO2,atm drop via reduced carbon release from the Southern Ocean. Although the impacts of shifted southern-hemisphere westerlies are inconsistent across model simulations, their intensification raises CO2,atm via enhanced Southern Ocean Ekman pumping. Increased supply of aeolian dust to the ocean, and thus iron fertilisation of marine productivity, consistently lowers modelled CO2,atm concentrations via more efficient nutrient utilisation. The magnitude of CO2,atm change in response to dust flux variations, however, largely depends on the complexity of models' marine ecosystem and iron cycle. This especially applies to simulations forced by Antarctic sea ice changes, in which the direction of simulated CO2,atm change varies greatly across model hierarchies. Our compilation highlights that no single (forcing) mechanism can explain observed past millennial-scale CO2,atm variability, and identifies important future needs in coupled carbon cycle-climate modelling to better understand the mechanisms governing CO2,atm changes in the past. © 2019 The Authors","Atmospheric CO2 variations; Carbon cycle; Dust; Freshwater hosing; Palaeoclimate modelling; Sea ice; Southern-hemisphere westerlies","Carbon dioxide; Dust; Ecosystems; Iron; Numerical models; Sea ice; Water; Atlantic meridional overturning circulations; Carbon cycles; Freshwater hosing; Marine productivity; Model representation; Numerical model simulations; Palaeoclimate; Southern Hemisphere; Oceanography; air-soil interaction; air-water interaction; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; dust; Ekman pumping; eolian deposit; Kimmeridgian; marine ecosystem; meridional circulation; numerical model; paleoclimate; sea ice; simulation; Southern Hemisphere; terrestrial environment; westerly; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Pacific Ocean; Southern Ocean",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069643151

Options to improve sanitation within the Morelos State in Mexico were compared applying a modification of the IPCC guidelines to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A 2030 business-as-usual scenario which considers current sanitation practices and 2010 baseline-scenario, showed that septic tanks, the main state option for sanitation, were the principal source of emissions, even higher than from non-controlled wastewater discharges. These scenarios also revealed that the two metropolitan areas were key in terms of mitigation as they contributed 88% of the total GHG emissions. For the 2030A scenario (sanitation + adaptation), it was seen that if the policy of septic tank usage continues, and the existing wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are rehabilitated, the GHG emissions would be reduced by 2% compared to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. In contrast, if a policy were adopted considering in addition mitigation measures, 26% GHG emissions reduction might be achieved. Additional co-benefits will be obtained in several sectors, including health (diarrheal and dengue diseases control), agriculture, and the environment, performing a more efficient and integrated management of water and achieving savings on the operating costs of WWTPs through co-generation. © IWA Publishing 2019.","Adaptation; Developing countries; GHG emissions; Mitigation; Sanitation; Septic tanks","Agricultural robots; Disease control; Emission control; Gas emissions; Operating costs; Sanitation; Septic tanks; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Water management; Business-as-usual; Co-generation; Integrated management; Metropolitan area; Mitigation measures; Single source; Wastewater discharge; Wastewater treatment plants; Greenhouse gases; adaptive management; climate change; developing world; mitigation; sanitation; wastewater treatment; water treatment; Mexico [North America]; Morelos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090036673

Several factors are affecting the availability of fresh water, like global population growth and the increase of industrial activities. Particularly in the mining industry, water is a critical resource for mineral production and road maintenance. Haul roads in surface mining operations are traditionally treated with large amounts of water to reduce dust emissions caused by large trucks that generate up to 97% of mine dust that reduces safety and mining productivity. An alternative to reduce dust in mining roads is the use of Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate (6H2O·MgCl2), which is a byproduct of the local lithium. So far, there is no scientific evidence that combines laboratory and field research to assess the effectiveness of an industrial byproduct used as a dust control for mining haul roads. This paper reports a quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of 6H2O·MgCl2 in reducing operational water based on a laboratory and field study. Laboratory results show an important water retention effect in 6H2O·MgCl2 treated soils compared to untreated soils. In addition, results showed that soils exposed to higher air relative humidity increases the water absorption from the air, confirming the hygroscopic property of 6H2O·MgCl2. Field results collected for a year in a copper mine located in an arid area of Chile showed that water consumption in haul roads treated with water only is on average 153 times higher than water consumption in roads treated with 6H2O·MgCl2 brine. In other words, 6H2O·MgCl2 brine treatment allows approximately 99% of water saving. The dust monitoring system using a laser device demonstrated that, on average, dust emissions are 3.4 times higher in roads treated with water only than in roads treated with 6H2O·MgCl2 brine. Overall, the study concludes that using 6H2O·MgCl2 brine effectively reduces water consumption used for dust suppression in haul roads, demonstrating that the use of 6H2O·MgCl2 byproduct is a very promising material for addressing water management issues in the mining industry. © 2019","Byproduct; Dust; Mining; Roads; Water","Arid regions; Byproducts; Chlorine compounds; Copper mines; Dust; Dust control; Groundwater; Industrial research; Magnesium compounds; Mine trucks; Mineral industry; Mining; Population statistics; Roads and streets; Soils; Water; Water absorption; Water conservation; Water supply; Water treatment; Critical resources; Hygroscopic properties; Industrial activities; Industrial by-products; Laboratory and field studies; Magnesium chlorides; Roads; Scientific evidence; Mine dust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065836797

Such an emission pathway in this compound can be effectively tuned and strengthened in response to the aggregation-induced emission effect as well as the fluorescence resonance energy transfer process, which totally allow a ca. 15-fold amplification of the quantum yield of this material as compared to the routine precursors. Moreover, the luminescence in this system can also be smartly regulated by many factors including protonation, light irradiation, and solution type. Enhanced emission can be maintained in the dye-doped polymer film, providing new visions for the development of advanced solid-state emissive materials.

The objective of this review is to summarize evidence of the various roles that the U.S. beef industry plays in the U.S. and global agricultural systems. As the world’s largest beef producer, the United States reaps considerable economic benefit from the beef industry through strong domestic and international demand, as well as employment opportunities for many Americans. Beef production contributes to GHG emissions, land use, and water use, among other critical environmental impacts but provides an important source of essential micronutrients for human consumption. The U.S. beef industry provides sufficient product to meet the protein, vitamin B12, omega-3 and -6 fatty acid requirements of 43, 137, 47, and 487 million people, respectively. In the United States, beef production was estimated to account for 53% of GHG emissions from U.S. animal agriculture and 25% of GHG emissions from all of U.S. agriculture. Footprinting studies suggest that much of the land use and water use associated with beef production are attributed to the development of feed crops or pastureland. On a global scale, beef from U.S. origin is exported to numerous developed and developing countries, representing an important international nutrient routing. Along with other prominent beef-producing nations, the United States continues to pursue a greater level of sustainability in its cattle industry, which will bear important implications for future global food security. Efforts to reduce the environmental impacts of beef production will likely be the strongest drivers of enhanced sustainability. © The Author(s) 2019.

The approach highlights the parameters which mainly affect the ABR process performance in all indicators simultaneously. A sensitivity index quantifies the variation range of the ABR performance indicators with respect to parameter variability. Cost functions are developed which combine both performance indicators and state process variables. These are used to identify thermodynamic models which simultaneously a) enable close match of simulation results and reference data, b) maintain low process variability and c) give rise to process state and performance profiles of low non-linearity, despite changes in model parameters.

The present work quantitatively assesses changes in trace element emissions stemming from CAAAs compliance, attributes these changes to specific CAAAs compliance strategies, and discusses implications for future environmental regulatory design. We combine plant-level coal purchase and installed air pollution control device data with a trace element partitioning model to approximate changes in trace element mass entering and exiting CFPPs in the solid, liquid, and gas phase between 1993 and 2017. Though US coal combustion decreased by 2% during this period, the vast majority of trace element emissions reductions stem from the 18-64% reductions in the fleet-wide average concentrations of arsenic, bromine, chloride, lead, mercury, and selenium in the combusted coal. Combined with the installation of air pollution control technologies, these shifts resulted in nationwide reductions of gas phase trace element emissions by between 49 and 68% for the elements included in this study. In contrast, installation of flue gas desulfurization devices increased the mass of trace elements discharged in wastewater.

Moreover, providers must also provision high levels of availability and reliability, hence cloud services are frequently replicated across servers that subsequently increases server energy consumption and resource overhead. These two objectives can present a potential conflict within cloud resource management decision making that must balance between service consolidation and replication to minimize energy consumption whilst maximizing server availability and reliability, respectively. In this paper, we propose a cuckoo optimization-based energy-reliability aware resource scheduling technique (CRUZE) for holistic management of cloud computing resources including servers, networks, storage, and cooling systems. CRUZE clusters and executes heterogeneous workloads on provisioned cloud resources and enhances the energy-efficiency and reduces the carbon footprint in datacenters without adversely affecting cloud service reliability. We evaluate the effectiveness of CRUZE against existing state-of-the-art solutions using the CloudSim toolkit.

Existing work often assumes that firms disapprove of climate regulation due to the immediate costs of compliance. We claim that if policy is implemented gradually, private preferences for climate policy vary as a function of its progressive stringency. That is, supportive views may rise in the initial phase of the policy, while opposing views may emerge as the policy becomes more stringent. We also argue that emissions of individual companies, as well as emissions levels in their respective sectors, influence corporate positions on these two dimensions. We test our argument with new corporate survey data on the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). We find that firms’ views on the performance of the EU ETS vary based on whether they concentrate on the policy’s current state or its future, more stringent development. Moreover, we find that individual firm and sectoral emissions correlate with support for the early-stage, more lenient version of the ETS, but that high-emission firms are more interested in disinvesting and relocating if the ETS becomes stricter. Our findings imply that both firm and sectoral organization can constrain environmental regulation, and that domestic compensation, especially at early stages, can have important effects on the continuity of climate policy. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Climate policy; Corporate interests; Environmental regulation; European Union; Opinion survey",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051108305

Energy efficiency measures and renewable energy use play an important role, especially regarding retrofit of existing buildings. Identification of retrofit opportunities and aggregation of projects to benefit from economy of scale are a precondition for the implementation of large-scale renovation projects. The ENERFUND project, funded by the HORIZON 2020 programme, provides data from Energy Performance Certificates according to EPBD publicly available in the form of a map and combines them with other geo-referenced data and general information to allow for the rating of deep renovation and carbon reduction opportunities. In this way, the tool assists in identifying retrofit opportunities and aggregation of projects for financing. It also assists in supply-side energy spatial planning, because it shows where energy consumption is likely to decrease due to economic renovation potentials. This contribution shows an overview of data available for thirteen European Member States. Data sources and differences regarding the type of data are explained, and challenges such as data quality issues and data protection concerns are discussed. It is demonstrated that the ENERFUND tool certainly assists in decarbonizing the European building stock, although some improvements are still necessary. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Transport sector in general and road transport in particular have a prominent contribution in intensifying the causes of climate change. Mitigating the vehicular greenhouse gas emission is one of the finest approaches to deal with climate change. Thus, the main aim of the study is to examine the vehicular greenhouse gas emission reduction measures being undertaken in the emerging cities of Ethiopia. The study has employed a descriptive research method with qualitative and quantitative research approaches. Data for the study were obtained from the emerging and second largest city of Ethiopia, Mekelle. Auxiliary facts are also obtained from the other two emerging regional capital cities (Bahir Dar and Adama) and one city council (Dire Dawa) of Ethiopia. This study has found that two measures of reducing vehicular greenhouse gas emissions are being undertaken in the urban road transport of Ethiopia: the technical and nontechnical measures. The technical measures of reducing vehicular emissions entertain mechanical measures taken by drivers. These include: use of biofuel, annual inspections of cars and complying with speed limits. Nontechnical measures, on the other hand, incorporate policy measures carried out to reduce the levels of emissions. These include: extending public transport services, promoting the use of non-motorized transport, taxing vehicles, integrating urban transport with the land use planning, improving and extending urban road infrastructures, regulation of transport-related legislation, and organizing civil society movements to mitigate vehicular emissions. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13146, 2019. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","climate change; CO2; ethanol and biodiesel; mitigation; motor vehicle","Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Laws and legislation; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Urban transportation; American Institute of Chemical Engineers; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; mitigation; Motor vehicle; Public transport service; Quantitative research; Technical measures; Vehicular emission; Nonmotorized transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062701357

Four samples of depleted uranium with two different starting microstructures (cast and rolled) were used for this study. The hydrogen charged samples (rolled 1.8 wppm H and cast 14 wppm H by weight) are representative of the pre-corrosion states with hydrides distributed throughout the bulk. In-depth LIBS measurements were carried out, after the thick surface corrosion layer was removed, by applying 100 laser pulses from sample surface into the bulk on five different sample locations. Three additional areas on each sample were studied by laser ablation using a 12-point grid approach. The atomic emission signals of elemental uranium, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen were identified and analyzed. All four samples showed similar uranium and carbon concentrations, as expected. Hydrogen content was consistent with each sample's specification, such that the hydrogen charged samples exhibited higher hydrogen concentration than their references. Both specimens charged with hydrogen showed elevated oxygen content as well, due to rapid oxidation of uranium and uranium hydrides. The oxidation process was facilitated by the laser ablation and plasma plume's high temperature effects on the sample combined with the glovebox environment. The uranium surface damage produced by laser ablation was quantitatively evaluated by optical microscopy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Hand-held LIBS; Hydride corrosion; Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy; Surface damage, hydrogen embrittlement; Uranium","Ablation; Atomic emission spectroscopy; Carbon; Corrosion; High temperature effects; Hydrides; Hydrogen; Laser ablation; Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy; Oxygen; Uranium; Carbon concentrations; Hand-held LIBS; Hydrogen concentration; Hydrogen contents; Laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS); Qualitative evaluations; Surface corrosion; Surface damages; Uranium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069924830

The long-term sustainability visions (in Switzerland the ""2000 W Society"" by year 2100) imply not only technological changes but above all radical changes in the human behaviour. A multidisciplinary study, carried out by SUPSI and specialists, proposes a method for determining the parameters for the design of a building by year 2100. It also shows that in order to achieve long-term sustainability goals (primary energy reduction and CO2 emissions per capita, 2000 W and max 1 ton CO2), alimentation can be considered as a building need. The high potential in reducing primary energy needs in this area makes possible to compensate others energy consumptions and CO2 emissions of the building inhabitants and of the building itself. The sustainable building of the future shall therefore: - present a zero or compensated operating energy need; - present minimal energy need for construction; - allow food production (Urban Farming, Building Integrated Agriculture) through natural and regenerative agriculture (self-production); - promote and act as a shelter for local flora and fauna (regenerative); - respect the soil stratigraphy (reversible). © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

However, soil nitrate is also used by denitrifying bacteria, which reduce it to N2O (a greenhouse gas) and N2. Therefore, plants are in direct competition with these bacteria for the assimilation of nitrate. Recently, our research team has highlighted a strategy developed by some plants consisting of the production of secondary metabolites (procyanidins) that inhibit the denitrification activity of microbial communities in soils, referred to as BDI for biological denitrification inhibition (BDI). This strategy could make nitrate more available in the soil, which may then be used by plants for their growth. However, the extent to which procyanidins can affect plant growth and nutrition via BDI under field conditions has not yet been investigated. In this study, we tested the effect of procyanidins exogenously applied in the field on the nutrition and growth of cos or romaine lettuce crops (Lactuca sativa) nutrition and growth. Procyanidins were added to growing lettuce at 8, 42, 83 and 210 kg ha−1. Soil denitrification enzyme activity (DEA), nitrate concentration, above- and below-ground lettuce traits and the abundance of total bacteria and denitrifiers were measured in lettuces treated or untreated with procyanidins. Our results showed that the addition of procyanidins in the field at 210 kg ha−1 resulted in: (1) the inhibition of microbial denitrification activity and counter-selection of denitrifiers in the root-adhering soil of lettuce and (2) an increase in available nitrate and a significant gain in plant productivity. This study allowed us to propose for the short term the development of a more environmentally friendly method of sustainable agriculture by limiting fertilizer inputs, nitrogen losses from the soil, and greenhouse gas emissions while increasing plant growth and productivity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biological denitrification inhibition; Denitrifiers; Field experiment; Lettuce; Nitrate; Plant traits; Productivity; Rhizosphere","Agriculture; Bacteria; Biological filter beds; Enzyme activity; Flavonoids; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Metabolites; Nitrates; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nutrition; Productivity; Soil pollution; Soils; Biological denitrification; Denitrifiers; Field experiment; Lettuce; Plant traits; Rhizosphere; Denitrification; alternative agriculture; bacterium; concentration (composition); denitrification; enzyme activity; fertilizer application; field method; greenhouse gas; growth; inhibition; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrate; nutrition; rhizosphere; secondary metabolite; soil microorganism; vegetable; Lactuca; Lactuca sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067600897

(1) Background: African Americans constitute 32.4% of Georgia’s population, making it the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the state followed by Hispanic Americans at 9.8%. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and lower wealth groups are more likely than most middle and upper income White Americans to be exposed to environmental pollutants. This is true because racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to live in urban areas where pollution is more concentrated. As a point of departure, we examine PM2.5 concentrations specific to prescribed fire smoke, which typically emanates from fires occurring in rural or peri-urban areas. Two objectives are specified: a) examine the association between percent African American and PM2.5 concentrations at the census tract level for Georgia, and b) identify emitters of PM2.5 concentrations that exceed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the 24-h average, i. e., &gt;35 µg/m3. (2) Methods: For the first objective, we estimate a spatial Durbin error model (SDEM) where pollution concentration (PM2.5) estimates for 1683 census tracts are regressed on percent of the human population that is African American or Hispanic; lives in mobile homes; and is employed in agriculture and related occupations. Also included as controls are percent evergreen forest, percent mixed evergreen/deciduous forest, and variables denoting lagged explanatory and error variables, respectively. For the second objective, we merge parcel and prescribed burn permit data to identify landowners who conduct prescribed fires that produce smoke exceeding the NAAQS. (3) Results: Percent African American and mobile home dweller are positively related to PM2.5 concentrations; and government and non-industrial private landowners are the greatest contributors to exceedance levels (4) Conclusions: Reasons for higher PM2.5 concentrations in areas with higher African American and mobile home percent are not clear, although we suspect that neither group is a primary contributor to prescribed burn smoke but rather tend to live proximate to entities, both public and private, that are. Also, non-industrial private landowners who generated prescribed burn smoke exceeding NAAQS are wealthier than others, which suggests that African American and other environmental justice populations are less likely to contribute to exceedance levels in the state. © 2019 by the authors.

Despite the increasing understanding of metabolic processes in tropical lakes, our knowledge on how morphometric and catchment characteristics affect metabolic responses to those changes in tropical lakes is still very scarce. We investigated how metabolic rates in the upper mixed layer of twelve Brazilian tropical lakes responded to reduced rainfall, considering their lake area and drainage area ratio and the percentage of native forest cover in their drainage area. An 80% reduction in the 2013 rainy season rainfall, compared with 2012, resulted in a reduction of approximated 1 m in the water column depth, a 1–2 m deepening of the upper mixed layer, a 50% reduction in mean light availability, and a doubling in total phosphorus concentrations. These changes were associated with 38% increases in gross primary production (GPP), stimulated by higher nutrient concentrations and reduced photoinhibition.

However, the influence of conventional fuels—diesel and gasoline, and particularly ATFs on photochemical air pollution is not well-characterized, limiting assessments of ATFs and air quality. This is mainly due to frequent use of lumped chemical mechanisms by related atmospheric modeling. Here we hypothesized that applying a chemical mechanism that is specifically developed according to both emission fractions and photochemical ozone creation potential of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is key to gaining reliable insights into the impact of transportation fuels on photochemistry. We used a heterogeneous chemical mechanism with 927 reactions and relatively detailed emission inventories to specifically meet the requirements for reliable simulation of the effect of exhaust emissions from vehicles fueled by selected model fuels—diesel, gasoline, and mixtures of 15% gasoline with 85% ethanol (E85) or 85% methanol (M85)—on photochemistry. These dispersion-box model simulations revealed a strong influence of atmospheric background balance between VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NOX = [NO] + [NO2]) on the impact of exhaust emissions on photochemistry, with higher tendency toward ozone (O3) formation or destruction for more VOC-limited or NOX-limited conditions, respectively. Accordingly, higher [NOX]/[VOC] exhaust emission, such as from diesel and M85, resulted in lower O3, not only locally but also downwind of the emission. This offers a new perspective and measure for transportation fuel assessment. Rapid conversion of O3 to hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals downwind of the exhaust emission indicates the importance of simulating the impact of road transportation on photochemistry at high spatial and temporal resolution. Peroxyacetyl nitrate formation was more sensitive to VOC emission under VOC-limited conditions than to NOX emission under NOX-limited conditions. Secondary formaldehyde dominated over primary emitted formaldehyde several minutes after emission. These findings should be verified using a 3D modeling study under varying meteorological conditions. This study provides new insights into the impact of transportation on photochemical processes, and offers a new perspective and measure for ranking transportation fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Modeling; Ozone; Photochemistry; Transportation fuel","3D modeling; Air pollution; Air quality; Alternative fuels; Atmospheric chemistry; Chemical reactions; Diesel engines; Ethanol fuels; Formaldehyde; Methanol fuels; Models; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Volatile organic compounds; Meteorological condition; Peroxyacetyl nitrates; Photochemical air pollution; Photochemical ozone creation potentials; Photochemical process; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Transportation fuels; Vehicle exhaust emissions; Gasoline; alcohol; biofuel; diesel fuel; E85 fuel; formaldehyde; gasoline; hydroperoxyl radical; hydroxyl group; M85 fuel; methanol; nitrogen oxide; ozone; peroxyacetylnitrate; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; gasoline; hydroxyl radical; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; dispersion; ozone; photochemistry; three-dimensional modeling; traffic emission; volatile organic compound; Article; atmosphere; chemical composition; chemical modification; chemical reaction; dispersion box modeling; exhaust gas; model; photochemistry; simulation; air pollutant; air pollution; exhaust gas; photochemistry; theoretical model; traffic and transport; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Gasoline; Hydroxyl Radical; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen Oxides; Ozone; Photochemistry; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069868112

To better understand the complex defect chemistry and role of impurity phases in this material and their effect on the photochemical performance, we employ visible light transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the electron dynamics in electrochemically deposited Cu-Fe oxide thin films. Kinetic analysis of carrier lifetime shows a fast, sub-ps contribution to relaxation followed by persistence of a long-lived state to time delays greater than 2 ns. Increasing amplitude of the long-lived state is shown to correlate with the rate of fast initial relaxation, and this is explained in terms of a competition between charge carrier trapping and charge separation. Charge separation in CuFeO2 occurs via hole thermalization from O 2p to Cu 3d valence band states leading to segregation of electrons and holes across layers in the CuFeO2 lattice. Correlation between transient absorption measurements and DFT calculations suggest that Cu vacancies enhance photochemical performance by facilitating charge separation kinetics. In contrast, O interstitials are predicted to switch the relative positions of O 2p and Cu 3d valence band states, which would inhibit charge separation by inter-band hole thermalization. Finally, we find no evidence for electron injection from CuFeO2 to CuO suggesting that charge separation at this heterostructure interface does not play a role in the carrier lifetime or photochemical performance of the catalysts studied here.

The two major concerns of ambient air quality in China are particulate matter (PM) and tropospheric ozone (O3). With the implementation of air pollution prevention and control actions in the last five years, the PM pollution in China has been substantially reduced. In contrast, under the conditions of the urban air pollution complex, the elevated O3 levels in city clusters of eastern China, especially in warm seasons, have drawn increasing attention. Emissions of air pollutants and their precursors not only contribute to regional air quality, but also alter climate. Climate change in turn can change chemical processes, long-range transport, and local meteorology that influence air pollution. Compared to PM, less is known about O3 pollution and its climate effects over China. Here, we present a review of the main findings from the literature over the period 2011–18 with regard to the characteristics of O3 concentrations in China and the mechanisms that drive its interannual to decadal variations, aiming to identify robust conclusions that may guide decision-making for emissions control and to highlight critical knowledge gaps. We also review regional and global modeling studies that have investigated the impacts of tropospheric O3 on climate, as well as the projections of future tropospheric O3 owing to climate and/or emission changes. © 2019, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","chemistry-climate interactions; China; interannual and decadal variations; tropospheric ozone",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068703158

Despite availability of column-averaged dry air mole fraction of CO2 ((Formula presented.)) from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), temporal variations of (Formula presented.) and their drivers in cities remain poorly understood due to inconsistent definitions of urban extent, diverse urban forms, and unresolved impacts of urban vegetation on carbon fluxes. To this end, this study revealed that OCO-2 (Formula presented.) measurements from 2014 to 2018 exhibited statistically significant seasonal and trend components for each city. A correlation analysis suggested a weak association between (Formula presented.) trends and fossil fuel CO2 emissions ((Formula presented.)) trends but a close relationship between yearly average (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) trends. Vegetation abundance exhibited a negative relationship with the (Formula presented.) seasonality, though it only explained 21% of the variance. No statistically significant relationship between urban morphological factors (areal extent, complexity, and compactness) and temporal (Formula presented.) components was observed. However, urban morphological factors had a close relationship with the total amount of (Formula presented.) aggregated over the study period. Thus, it was speculated that urban morphological factors exerted their influence on (Formula presented.) through fossil fuel consumption. When only cities of high normalized difference vegetation index seasonality were used, statistically significant correlation coefficients between urban morphological factors and winter/summer averaged (Formula presented.) measurements were found. The variations of these correlation coefficients between leaf-on and leaf-off seasons stress the important role that urban trees play in mitigating carbon emissions in cities. © 2019.

However, land is limiting, creating interest in a rapidly growing aquatic farming sector of seaweed aquaculture [3–5]. Synthesizing data from scientific literature, we assess the extent and cost of scaling seaweed aquaculture to provide sufficient CO2eq sequestration for several climate change mitigation scenarios, with a focus on the food sector—a major source of greenhouse gases [6]. Given known ecological constraints (nutrients and temperature), we found a substantial suitable area (ca. 48 million km2) for seaweed farming, which is largely unfarmed. Within its own industry, seaweed could create a carbon-neutral aquaculture sector with just 14% (mean = 25%) of current seaweed production (0.001% of suitable area). At a much larger scale, we find seaweed culturing extremely unlikely to offset global agriculture, in part due to production growth and cost constraints. Yet offsetting agriculture appears more feasible at a regional level, especially areas with strong climate policy, such as California (0.065% of suitable area). Importantly, seaweed farming can provide other benefits to coastlines affected by eutrophic, hypoxic, and/or acidic conditions [7, 8], creating opportunities for seaweed farming to act as “charismatic carbon” that serves multiple purposes. Seaweed offsetting is not the sole solution to climate change, but it provides an invaluable new tool for a more sustainable future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","aquatic farming; carbon capture; carbon market; mariculture; phycology","carbon; agriculture; aquaculture; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; metabolism; physiology; procedures; seaweed; Agriculture; Aquaculture; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Seaweed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072279807

Despite widespread agreement among researchers and policymakers that a carbon tax is the most efficient mechanism to curb greenhouse gas emissions, such a tax exacerbates inequality since low-income households spend a greater share of their income on carbon-intensive goods. Using Input-Output tables and detailed expenditure data for the United States, we estimate households' carbon footprints and examine the impact of a revenue-neutral tax of $50 per ton of CO2 on multiple forms of inequality. Devoting carbon tax revenue to fund a carbon dividend makes the policy progressive, minimizes redistribution among households of similar means, mitigates group-based inequalities, and benefits 56% of people, including 84% in the bottom half of the distribution. While some researchers have dismissed dividends on efficiency grounds, we show that the double dividend typically associated with labor tax cuts is insufficient to protect the purchasing power of a majority of Americans. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dividend; Carbon tax; Climate change; Distribution; Environment; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Inequality","carbon dioxide; environmental economics; equity; expenditure; fossil fuel; global warming; greenhouse gas; household income; pollution tax; spatial distribution; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067989651

Corresponding seven-day composite influent samples of selected WWTPs showed high influent concentrations as well as very high removal rates for LAS and AES. However, average total LAS and AES effluent concentrations were still 14.4 μg/L and 0.57 μg/L, respectively. The LAS-byproducts di-alkyl tetralin sulfonates (DATSs), the TPs sulfophenyl alkyl carboxylic acids (SPACs) and sulfo-tetralin alkyl carboxylic acids (STACs) reached maximum effluent concentrations of 19 μg/L, 17 μg/L and 5.3 μg/L, respectively.

High concentrations of up to 7.4 μg/L were found for 41 polyethylenoglycol homologs. Quantified surfactants and their TPs and by-products together accounted for concentrations up to 82 μg/L in WWTP effluents. To determine the risk of individual surfactants and their mixtures, single homologs were grouped by a “weighted carbon number approach” to derive normalized Predicted No-Effect Concentrations (PNEC), based on experimental ecotoxicity data from existing risk assessments, complemented by suitable Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) predictions. Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) were derived by dividing effluent concentrations of surfactants by local dilution factors.

The PMOBs covered an area of 18 m² each, and were 0.70-m-thick. The first PMOB (control subarea) was constructed using the same soil used to cover closed landfill cells, i.e. a typical residual soil. The second PMOB (enriched subarea) was constructed with a mixture of the residual soil and mature compost, with a resulting organic matter content equal to 4.5%. CH4 and CO2 surface fluxes were measured in a relatively large (4.5 m²) static chamber. CH4, CO2 and O2 concentrations were also measured at different depths (0.10, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30 m) within PMOBs. The concentrations from the raw biogas were also measured. Methane oxidation efficiencies (Effox) were estimated based on the CO2/CH4 ratio. The average CH4 and CO2 concentrations in the raw biogas (42% and 32%, respectively) for the 16 campaigns corroborated those typically found in Brazilian landfills. Lower CH4 fluxes were obtained within the enriched subarea (average of 20 g.m-2.d-1), while the fluxes in the control subarea averaged 34 g.m-2.d-1. Effox values averaged 42% for the control subarea and 80% for the enriched one. The results indicate that there is a great potential to reduce landfill gas (LFG) emissions by using passive methane oxidation biosystems composed of enriched substrates (with a higher content of organic matter). © 2019 Cisa Publisher.","Biogas; Flux chamber; Landfill; Municipal solid waste; Passive methane oxidation biocover",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087829285

Public health has an essential role in climate planning and action: “Co-benefits” to health help underpin greenhouse gas reduction strategies, while safeguarding health—particularly of the most vulnerable—is a frontline local adaptation goal. Using the structure of the core functions and essential services (CFES), we reviewed the literature documenting the evolution of public health’s role in climate change action since the 2009 launch of the US CDC Climate and Health Program. We found that the public health response to climate change has been promising in the area of assessment (monitoring climate hazards, diagnosing health status, assessing vulnerability); mixed in the area of policy development (mobilizing partnerships, mitigation and adaptation activities); and relatively weak in assurance (communication, workforce development and evaluation). We suggest that the CFES model remains important, but is not aligned with three concepts—governance, implementation and adjustment—that have taken on increasing importance. Adding these concepts to the model can help ensure that public health fulfills its potential as a proactive partner fully integrated into climate policy planning and action in the coming decade. © 2019 by the authors.

They target the reproduction of large-scale weather patterns at multi-year time scales by both recognizing the long memory of some components of the climate system, and explicitly including the evolution of greenhouse gas concentrations as an external forcing. This study illustrates the use of decadal predictions to determine the near-future storminess at regional scales. Specifically, the evolution of extreme storm surges and sea levels along the Atlantic Iberian coast is assessed. Present (1980–2016) and near-future (2021–2024) storm surges are simulated over the northeast Atlantic, forced by atmospheric reanalyses (ERA-Interim) and decadal predictions (MiKlip), respectively. Results are then statistically analyzed to investigate the short-term effects of climate change and climate variability on extreme surges and extreme sea levels. Surges will increase mostly in early winter, while tides are largest in late winter. As a result, the impact of the increase in storminess on the extreme sea levels and coastal flooding will be modest, and the growth in extreme sea levels will be dominated by the contribution of mean sea level rise. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Decadal prediction; Numerical modeling; Portugal; SCHISM; Spain; Storm surge","climate change; climate variation; decadal variation; numerical model; prediction; sea level change; storm surge; Atlantic Coast [Europe]; Iberian Peninsula; Portugal; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047665364

However, following their use, their release into the environment is inevitable. While CNTs have been shown to influence soil bacterial diversity, albeit only at concentrations far exceeding predicted rates of release, the effects of rGO have only been examined using pure bacterial cultures, and those of aGO are unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of CNTs, rGO and aGO, at three time points (7, 14 and 30 days), and over a range of concentrations (1 ng, 1 μg and 1 mg kg dry soil−1), on soil bacterial diversity using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Graphite was included to facilitate comparisons with a similar and naturally occurring carbon material, while the inclusion of GO allowed the effects of GO modification to be isolated. Bacterial community composition, but not alpha diversity, was altered by all treatments except the low GO, low rGO and high aGO treatments on day 14 only. In all cases, the nanomaterials led to shifts in community composition that were of similar magnitude to those induced by graphite and GO, albeit with differences in the taxa affected. Our study highlights that carbon nanomaterials can induce changes in soil bacterial diversity, even at doses that are environmentally realistic. © 2019","Microbial diversity; Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Phylogenetic marker gene sequencing; Pollution; Risk assessment","Ammonia; Graphene; Graphite; Nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Nanotechnology; Pollution; Risk assessment; RNA; Soils; Tensile strength; Yarn; Bacterial community composition; Carbon nano-materials; Community composition; Functionalized graphene; High-tensile strength; Marker genes; Microbial diversity; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Carbon nanotubes; carbon nanotube; graphene oxide; graphite; RNA 16S; carbon nanotube; graphite; RNA 16S; biomarker; carbon nanotube; community composition; gene expression; microbial community; nanoparticle; nanotechnology; phylogenetics; risk assessment; soil microorganism; species diversity; amplicon; Article; controlled study; gene sequence; high throughput sequencing; microbial diversity; nonhuman; priority journal; risk assessment; soil microflora; bacterial phenomena and functions; drug effect; microbiology; microflora; sequence analysis; soil pollutant; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Graphite; Microbiota; Nanotubes, Carbon; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065852564

This regulation is part of the EU's commitments to comply with the Paris Agreement. According to the new regulation, emissions and removals for managed forest land are to be accounted against a projected forest reference level (FRL) that is estimated by each EU Member State based on the continuation of forest management practices of the reference period 2000-2009. The aim of this study is to assess how different modelling assumptions possible under the regulation may influence the FRL estimates. Applying the interlinked G4M and WoodCarbonMonitor modelling frameworks, we estimate potential FRLs for each individual EU Member State following a set of conceptual scenarios, each reflecting different modelling assumptions that are consistent with the regulation and the technical guidance document published by the European Commission. Results: The simulations of the conceptual scenarios show that differences in the underlying modelling assumptions may have a large impact on the projected FRL. Depending on the assumptions taken, the projected annual carbon sink on managed forest land in the EU varies from -319 MtCO2 to -397 MtCO2 during the first compliance period (2021-2025) and from -296 MtCO2 to -376 MtCO2 during the second compliance period (i.e. 2026-2030). These estimates can be compared with the 2017 national GHG inventories which estimated that the forest carbon sink for managed forest land was -373 MtCO2 in 2015. On an aggregated EU level, the assumptions related to climate change and the allocation of forest management practices have the largest impacts on the FRL estimates. On the other hand, assumptions concerning the starting year of the projection, stratification of managed forest land, and timing of individual management activities are found to have relatively small impacts on the FRL estimates. Conclusions: We provide a first assessment of the level of uncertainty associated with the different assumptions discussed in the technical guidance document and the LULUCF regulation, and the impact of these assumptions on the country-specific FRL. The results highlight the importance of transparent documentation by the EU Member States on how their FRL has been calculated, and on the underlying assumptions. © 2019 The Author(s).","Carbon accounting; EU LUUCF regulation; Forest management; Forests; G4M; LULUCF; Reference levels; WoodCarbonMonitor",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071908365

Inoculation thus increases and decreases C and N availabilities to denitrifiers in the rhizosphere, respectively. Hence, denitrification rates in the rhizosphere can be positively or negatively influenced by root activity depending on the balance between these two processes. We assumed that inoculation effect on denitrifiers could strongly differ according to soil conditions. Would denitrifiers be mostly limited by C, inoculation would increase denitrifier abundance and activity through increased labile C availability. Would denitrifiers be limited by N rather than C, inoculation would decrease denitrifier abundance and activity through increased competition for N. Here we manipulated denitrification limitation by C and N (i) in a field trial through the use of different fertilization levels, and (ii) in a growth chamber experiment by mimicking root exudate inputs. We analyzed how the effects of maize inoculation by the PGPR Azospirillum lipoferum CRT1 on potential gross and net N2O production rates and NO2 −- and N2O-reducer abundances were related to C and N limitation levels. An increase in potential gross (up to +113%) and to a lesser extent net (+37%) N2O production was observed for soils where denitrification was highly limited by C. This was explained by strong and moderate increases in the abundances of NO2 −- and N2O-reducers, respectively. In contrast, when denitrification was weakly limited by C, gross and net N2O productions were negatively affected by inoculation (−15 and −40%, respectively). Our results show that the inoculation practice should be evaluated in term of possible increased crop yield but also possible modified N2O emission, paying much attention to cropland soils where denitrifiers are highly limited by C. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","nirK; nirS; nosZI; nosZII; Plant-microbes competition for nitrate; Root exudates","Bacteria; Carbon; Nitrogen oxides; Plants (botany); Seed; Soils; nirK; nirS; nosZI; nosZII; Root exudates; Denitrification; exudation; gene expression; microbial community; nitrate; rhizosphere; root system; soil microorganism; Azospirillum lipoferum; Rhizobiales; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068546266

Soil phosphorus impoverishment in parts of the Amazon basin largely controls its functioning, but the role of phosphorus availability has not been considered in global model ensembles—for example, during the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project. Here we simulate the planned free-air CO2 enrichment experiment AmazonFACE with an ensemble of 14 terrestrial ecosystem models. We show that phosphorus availability reduces the projected CO2-induced biomass carbon growth by about 50% to 79 ± 63 g C m−2 yr−1 over 15 years compared to estimates from carbon and carbon–nitrogen models. Our results suggest that the resilience of the region to climate change may be much less than previously assumed. Variation in the biomass carbon response among the phosphorus-enabled models is considerable, ranging from 5 to 140 g C m−2 yr−1, owing to the contrasting plant phosphorus use and acquisition strategies considered among the models. The Amazon forest response thus depends on the interactions and relative contributions of the phosphorus acquisition and use strategies across individuals, and to what extent these processes can be upregulated under elevated CO2. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; climate change; concentration (composition); fertilizer application; forest ecosystem; nutrient availability; phosphorus; rainforest; terrestrial ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070223216

In order to ensure that radio broadcasting services or terrestrial navigation systems are not disturbed by WTs, the radiated EM emissions have to be measured and assessed in the CISPR Bands A to D (from 9 kHz to 1 GHz) according to the corresponding standards. Due to the enormous size of a WT, it seem to be reasonable to evaluate, whether the emission measurement is be carried out in the far field region. For this reason, numerical field calculations are carried out by means of an simplified WT model. It points out, that far field region of the radiated emissions is not located in the standardized measurement distance of 30 m, but a distance of more than 3 km with respect to the WT. Assuming that a real world WT behaves similarly than simulation model used for the numerical field calculations, the measuring locations defined in the corresponding standards are only conditionally suitable for electrical large radiators like wind turbines. © 2019 IEEE.","far field region; in situ measurement; radiated emission; wind energy conversion system; wind turbine","Electromagnetic compatibility; Energy conversion; Navigation systems; Radio broadcasting; Radio navigation; Wind turbines; Broadcasting service; Emission measurement; Far-field region; In-situ measurement; Radiated emissions; Standardized measurement; Terrestrial navigation; Wind energy conversion system; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074351224

Inspired by our experimental observations related to wave-rotor combustion chamber ignition, this work employs a numerical method to examine the sudden injection of a hot jet into a quiescent mixture of CH4–H2-air and the subsequent ignition. The goal is to provide the range of thermo-physical scalars that are supportive of successful ignition. The evolution of scalar fields is evaluated using large-eddy simulation (LES). The temporal evolution of mixture fraction, the squared gradient of mixture fraction (as indicative of scalar dissipation rate), strain rate, and intermediate species are investigated in order to find the appropriate physical conditions which support ignition. Independent distribution of stain rate and squared gradient of mixture fraction, especially in the leading head vortex, shows the necessity of correlated scalar analysis of the ignition process. Experimental and numerical methods are then employed to provide the qualitative and quantitative understanding of ignition process for fuels with two distinct hydrogen contents. Results show the meaningful difference in spatial distribution of local ignition as hydrogen content of the fuel increases. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Hot jet ignition; Large eddy simulation; Transient jet","Combustion chambers; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Large eddy simulation; Mixtures; Numerical methods; Strain rate; Experimental and numerical methods; Hydrogen contents; Intermediate specie; Lean-burn combustion; Physical conditions; Scalar dissipation rate; Temporal evolution; Transient jet; Starting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069954295

This paper provides an overview of the farming situation on organic soils in a western region of Switzerland characterized by intensive vegetable farming and therefore by high opportunity costs of adopting sustainable practices on these soils. Based on a review of the academic and grey literature and interviews with regional experts, we find that the main challenges to a change in management practices include the profitability of the current land use, the difficult economic environment of farmers, the cultural background associated with the region, and the absence of systematic data on soil properties. We provide a comparative overview of policy options that could promote sustainable use of organic soils, and present the diverse economic, environmental, and social implications of potential future scenarios of the development on these soils, namely pursuing the current land use versus adopting peat-preserving land use. Based on a basic economic analysis, we find that considering the carbon benefits of preserving the soils, current offsetting-carbon policies cannot compensate the opportunity cost of switching land use on organic soils used for intensive vegetable farming. With the price of carbon offsetting options, only up to the half of the opportunity cost would be covered. We therefore stress the need for a long-term vision of the management decision on these soils and for eliciting society's willingness to invest in preserving organic soils. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Management scenarios; Organic soils; Policies; Switzerland","farming system; land use planning; management practice; organic soil; peatland; policy approach; profitability; sustainable development; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067298110

This tree is commonly used in parks, avenues and gardens as ornamental species. The flowering period is short and abrupt between March and April, since this tree is characterized by having fast and explosive blooming process. This fact induces an important public health problem when Platanus bloom. The objective of the study is to evaluate the pollen and allergen concentration in two cities in the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula, Porto (Portugal) and Ourense (Spain), and analyse how weather parameters and environmental pollutants can affect the patterns of pollen and allergen airborne distribution. The pollen sampling was conducted, during 2018, using a Hirst volumetric sampler, and Pla a 1 aeroallergen was collected using a Burkard multivial cyclone sampler. The pollen counting was obtained following the Spanish Aerobiology Network methodology. Aeroallergens were quantified by ELISA method using a Pla a 1-specific antibody. Platanus pollen concentrations are seven times lower in the Porto atmosphere than in Ourense, but the Pla a 1 content is only 2 times higher in Ourense city. These differences can be explained by the influence of air pollutants in plants and meteorological factors. Platanus airborne pollen and Pla a 1 aeroallergen were correlated with some meteorological parameters, namely temperature, rainfall and relative humidity, and with atmospheric pollutants such as NO2 and O3. The results suggest the existence of different allergenic activities in the atmosphere of both cities. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Aeroallergen; Elisa; Plane tree; Pollutants; Weather variables","nitrogen dioxide; oxygen; pollen antigen; air pollutant; Article; concentration (parameter); correlational study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Europe; humidity; Iberian Peninsula; nonhuman; ornamental plant; Platanus; pollen; Portugal; priority journal; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064160787

These include increasing stress for calcifying species, e.g. macroalgae and shellfish. In this context, ocean acidification (OA) has the potential to affect important socioeconomic activities, including shellfish aquaculture, due to changes in the seawater carbonate system. However, coastal environments are characterised by strong diurnal pH fluctuations associated with the metabolic activity of macroalgae; that is, photosynthesis and respiration. This suggests that calcifying organisms that inhabit these ecosystems are adapted to this fluctuating pH environment. Macrophyte-dominated environments may have the potential to act as an OA buffering system in the form of a photosynthetic footprint, by reducing excess of CO2 and increasing the seawater pH and Ωarg. This can support calcification and other threatened physiological processes of calcifying organisms under a reduced pH environment. Because this footprint is supportive beyond the macroalgal canopy spatial area, this chemical refuge mechanism can be applied to support shellfish aquaculture, e.g. mussels. However, this approach should be tested in commercial shellfish farms to determine critical aspects of implementation. This includes critical factors such as target species and productivity rates. The degree of OA buffering capacity caused by the metabolic activity of macroalgae might depend on community structure and hydrodynamic conditions, creating site-specific responses. This concept might aid the development of future adaptive strategies, supporting marine ecological planning for the mussel aquaculture industry in Chile. © 2019, © 2019 International Phycological Society.","Calcification; Carbonate chemistry; Multitrophic aquaculture; Ocean acidification; pH",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073024925

The influence of atmospheric deposition on the soil–rice system in a typical urban agglomeration region was studied continuously through a field contrast experiment for two years. The results showed that the Cd and Pb in rice grains is mainly from soil, but Cd and Pb from the atmospheric deposition should be a focus of attention. The bioavailable content of heavy metals in atmospheric deposition is higher than that in corresponding surface soil. Atmospheric deposition contributed 10.8–47.7% of the Cd and Pb in brown rice, and 13.7–60.3% of the Cd and Pb in rice leaves was from atmospheric deposition. In the traffic area, a high deposition site, the contributions of atmospheric depositions to heavy metals in rice plants were higher than those from abandoned mine area and suburban area. Atmospheric deposition also consistently decreased the pH (0.17–0.66)and increased the exchangeable Cd (27.1–62.1%)and Pb (3.3–26.1%)in surface soil. In addition, the health risk index (HRI)of rice consumption was also increased as a result of the different atmospheric depositions of heavy metals, which accounted for 40.0% and 35.5% of Cd and Pb at the high deposition site, respectively.

For the good of nine million local citizens and incoming Asian Games, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Random Forest are used to analyze the air pollution in Hangzhou. Compared with the traditional atmospheric models, machine learning models are faster, more accurate and less costly in simulating all the pollutants without using the pollution inventory. The Feature Importance (FI) generated by Random Forest reveals the complicated relationships among air pollutants and meteorology. Carbon monoxide (CO) plays an important role in shaping ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matters (PM) in the atmospheric environment. Dew-point deficit plays a more important role than relative humidity in shaping air pollutants. Urban heat island effect is not obvious for the air pollutants from non-point source. Furthermore, a WRF/RNN-based method to forecast air pollutants, including SO2, NO2, CO, PM2.5, PM10 and O3, in the future 24 h is proposed and a RNN-based method to estimate regional transport rate of air pollutants and reversely identify air pollution emission sources is introduced.

Some nations are leading the scene by developing corresponding low carbon development strategies and policy measures to encourage socio-technical innovations. One of the key areas for low carbon urban development is the energy efficiency in buildings. The tendency of the rapidly growing population and urbanization asks for better narratives and practices improving the built environment. Cities and countries are keen on learning from best practice. Through international joint development projects, the ""knowledge resources"" - transnational, governmental, NGOs, practitioners, and academic actors - are disseminating the low carbon urban development ideas globally. What drives a successful translation of knowledge emerged from one social, economic, cultural, political, climatic and geographical context into a new one needs better clarification. This study explores the process of global circulation of sustainable innovation from a mobility and transition perspective. A conceptual framework is explored and tested through analysing the Passive House concept transferred from Germany to China. The study shows how the succinct form, co-evolving and re-contextualising attributes are key factors in circulating urban sustainability across context. Acknowledging the notion of adaptation and mutation in the translation process is a first step to address the discrepancies between the knowledge lending and receiving side, and further to foster the transformative learning. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

More recently, light-duty vehicle engine manufactures have combined these two technologies to take advantage of the knock benefits and fuel economy of GDI with the low particulate emission of PFI. These dual injection strategy engines have made a change in the combustion emission composition produced by these engines. Understanding the impact of these changes is essential for automotive companies and aftertreatment developers. A novel sampling system was designed to sample the exhaust generated by a dual injection strategy gasoline vehicle using the United States Federal Test Procedure (FTP). This sampling system was capable of measuring the regulated emissions as well as collecting the entire exhaust from the vehicle for measuring unregulated emissions. For this study, the unregulated emissions included hydrocarbon speciation and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAH), and oxygenated PAH (Oxy PAH). This novel sampling system allowed the quantification of the particulate-phase SVOC as part of the particulate on filters and the semi-volatile phase SVOC collected by XAD resin on traps. These compounds typically occur at very low levels in the exhaust and were determined by a gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) analytical method and a two dimensional gas chromatography procedure (GCXGC) with a time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. In addition, the vehicle was sampled both with and without aftertreatment to characterize the engine-out and tailpipe-out emissions for a dual fuel injection (combined GDI and PFI) vehicle. Engine-out emissions were determined to characterize the composition of the exhaust entering the aftertreatment, and the tailpipe-out emissions were measured to determine the concentration of SVOC entering the environment. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

However, due to large uncertainties in spatial climate datasets, the impacts of climate change and rising CO2 on net primary productivity (NPP) in Xinjiang have remained unclear. These uncertainties in climate will inevitably lead to uncertainties in model estimated NPP in Xinjiang. The uncertainties can be assessed by running an Arid Ecosystem Model (AEM) using multiple climate datasets. Such an approach allows to disentangle the relative contributions of individual climate factors on NPP change using numerical simulations and factorial analysis. The average annual NPP for Xinjiang from 2000 to 2014 was 155.90±2.74 g·C/(m2·year), 189.99±1.80 g·C/(m2·year), 213.04±8.93 g·C/(m2·year) by using the MERRA, ERA-Interim and CFSR datasets respectively to drive AEM. Our multiple simulations show a consistent temporal pattern of the regional NPP during 2000–2014 that increased during 2008–2011, and decreased during 2005–2006 and 2013–2014. However, we found large uncertainties in the spatial pattern of NPP change during this time, particularly in the Taklimakan Desert and northern Xinjiang (except for the Tacheng where NPP increased). All simulations indicated that areas surrounding the Taklamakan Desert and ecosystems at high latitude (&gt;47°) and northwestern Xinjiang were dominated by precipitation change. However, there are large uncertainties in the dominant climate driver in other areas. To assess uncertainties in ecosystem NPP assessment, efforts should be made to improve the confidence in climate data in the northern Xinjiang. This can be achieved by establishing more rain gauges. © 2019 The Authors","Arid Ecosystem Model (AEM); Climate dominating factors; Multiple datasets; Net Primary Productivity (NPP)","Climate models; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Large dataset; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Rain gages; Uncertainty analysis; Arid ecosystems; Dominating factors; Factorial analysis; Multiple data sets; Net primary productivity; Precipitation change; Rapid climate change; Relative contribution; Climate change; arid region; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; data set; ecological impact; ecosystem modeling; environmental factor; net primary production; precipitation (climatology); uncertainty analysis; China; Tacheng; Taklimakan Desert; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068717024

Abrupt enhancements of nitrogen-containing aerosols (e.g., NO3− and NH4+) were found in the winter, and nitrate became as a dominant contributor in high pollution days (e.g., PM2.5 &gt; 150 μg m−3). Nitrogen oxidation ratios (NOR) correlated significantly with aerosol liquid water content (ALWC), which was estimated by ISORPROPIA-II model. This suggested heterogeneous process might be an important pathway in nitrate formation during the high PM2.5 days. The nitrogen isotope composition (δ15N) in TN varied from −1.3 to +13.2‰ with a mean value of 6.9 ± 3.6‰ during the wintertime. An isotope-based source apportionment approach was then developed using a Bayesian isotope mixing model (SIAR) with chemical compositions as an important constrain, which improved accuracy and reduced the overall uncertainties in estimations of TN sources. From this optimized model, we identified six major sources including NH3 from combustion-related emissions (49%), NH3 derived from animal wastes (6%), NH3 from urban volatilization (3%), NOx derived from coal combustion (33%), NOx from biomass burning (5%) and NOx from vehicles (3%). Our results demonstrated that ambient NOx was dominated by coal combustion. Since NOx and NH3 are important precursors for ammonium nitrate aerosols, controlling of combustion related NOx and NH3 emissions might be an important way to reduce PM2.5 levels in this region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol liquid water content; Nitrogen-containing aerosols; Optimized Bayesian isotope mixing model","Aerosols; Agricultural wastes; Air pollution; Ammonia; Isotopes; Mixing; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; Aerosol measurement; Chemical compositions; Formation process; Inorganic nitrogen; Liquid water content; Mixing models; North China Plain; Source apportionment; Coal combustion; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066048442

In the global carbon emission structure, the proportion of household carbon emissions continues to increase, and it is necessary to focus on the issue of household emissions. Based on the perspective of the family sector and the comparison of urban-rural and interprovincial differences, this study makes a thorough and systematic analysis of the factors affecting direct household carbon emissions. The average carbon emission of urban households is higher than that of rural households. Both personal background and household energy consumption facility use have important impacts on household carbon emissions, and the degree of impact varies between urban and rural areas and between provinces. Reducing household carbon emissions and achieving a harmonious coexistence between man and nature are the common goals of the government and society. The government should explore the model of green sustainable development on the basis of ensuring the energy needs of residents. Residents should also further establish a low-carbon life concept and focus on the cultivation of low-carbon lifestyles. © 2019 by the authors.","Direct household carbon emission; Influencing factor; Interprovincial gap; Urban-rural gap","carbon emission; household energy; rural-urban comparison; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072612278

A healthy environment is fundamentally associated with walkable communities. According to a study in 2016 from the Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR) and the Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge, the health benefits of walking and cycling override the negative impacts of air pollution on health even in highly polluted cities. Additionally, planning walkable cities promote low carbon emission developments. Measuring walkability of the streets makes it possible for the planners and experts to address the quality of the built environment. This paper reports a practical assessment tool, developed in a master thesis, based on decisive walkability features by applying a weighting system to score those features in order to achieve a tangible outcome. For this reason, an examined weighting system from a previous study led by the Institute of Urban Planning and the University of Duisburg-Essen is optimized. Afterward, the proposed tool is applied for measuring the walkability in a selection of different streets in Hamburg, in order to answer the questions of how these Hamburg's streets differ in their degree of walkability and how their walkability can be improved. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

However, N2O emission from MWR needs to be quantified to propose management practices for N2O mitigation. A field experiment was conducted at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR-IARI), New Delhi, to assess the impacts of various N sources on N2O emission and its mitigation from the MWR. Six treatments –N0 (control), urea, urea + farmyard manure (FYM), FYM, urea + nitrification inhibitor (NI) and neem oil coated urea (NOCU) were investigated during 2012–2014. Results show ranges of N2O-N emissions from MWR of 0.59–0.69, 1.82–1.86, 1.81–1.85, 1.71–1.77, 1.38–1.52, 1.57–1.61 during 2012–2013, and of 0.62–0.68, 1.86–1.90, 1.78–1.84, 1.72–1.76, 1.40–1.46, 1.52–1.60 during 2013–2014, for N0, urea, urea + FYM, FYM, urea + NI and NOCU treatments, respectively. The 2-year pooled N2O-N emission of MWR decreased by 23% in urea + NI and by 16% in NOCU with higher grain yield as compared to conventional urea application. Application of FYM with urea and FYM alone also reduced N2O-N emission; however, the grain yields of these treatments were decreased. Thus, the study suggests that the application of NOCU and NI with urea can mitigate N2O-N emissions from the maize and wheat crops. Hence, the use of NOCU and application of NI with urea could be a better option to mitigate N2O-N emissions from MWR of the upper IGP of India. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","grain yield; Indo-Gangetic Plains; maize–wheat rotation; nitrous oxide emission","Fertilizers; Grain (agricultural product); Metabolism; Nitrogen oxides; Rotation; Urea; Agricultural research; Grain yield; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Management practices; Neem oil coated ureas; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrous oxide emissions; Water requirements; Silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070945995

Introduction of a water molecule in place of an acetonitrile ligand was evidenced by base titration and the presence of a remaining coordinated CH3CN by IR, 19F NMR, and theoretical methods. The proposed structure (CH3CN-Cu-(SR)-Cu-OH2) was successfully DFT-optimized and the calculated parameters are in agreement with the experimental data. [5] has a unique temperature-dependence EPR behavior, with a localized valence from 10 to 120 K that undergoes delocalized at room temperature. The electrochemical signatures are in the line of the other aquo parent [2] and sensibly different from the rest of the series. Similar to the case of [2], [5] was finally capable of single turnover N2O reduction at room temperature. N2 was detected by GC-MS, and the redox character was confirmed by EPR and ESI-MS. Kinetic data indicate a reaction rate order close to 1 and a rate 10 times faster compared to [2]. [5] is thus the second example of that kind and highlights not only the main role of the Cu-OH2 motif, but also that the adjacent Cu-X partner (X = OTf- in [2] and CH3CN in [5]) is a new actor in the casting to establish structure/activity correlations.

Extra oil recovery and CO2 sequestration associated with CWI have been studied through several experimental works. There are not adequate number of modelling studies about the CWI operation in the open sources because of the complex multi-physics involved with the fluid-fluid and fluid-rock interactions during CWI processes. Hence, further experimental and modelling investigations are needed to be conducted on CWI to systematically capture/comprehend the governing physics and complex displacement mechanisms. This research work will focus on the analysis of vital aspects such as oil recovery amount (and mechanisms), fluids distribution, and effects of operational parameters and well placement on the performance of CWI for both EOR and CO2 sequestration purposes. To achieve these objectives, a 3-D heterogenous reservoir model is developed using the experimental data reported in the recent literature. A new approach of using the grid local pressure to model CWI is adopted where the moles of CO2/water are controlled by their injection rates. The dissolution of CO2 in water is modeled by the Henry's law for each subsequent grid local pressure. In this research, it is found that through CWI, an additional oil recovery can be achieved when compared to plain (conventional) waterflooding (WF) in the secondary recovery mode. A subsequent increase in the injection pressure leads to more dissolution of CO2 and enhancement of the overall performance of CWI. There is an optimum injector rate, which ensures an effective mass transfer across phases. An optimal well orientation will also give a better recovery performance during CWI. The amount of CO2 stored is also illustrated in this work as an additional benefit achieved in the CWI processes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonated water injection (CWI); CO2 storage; Grid local pressure; Oil recovery factor; Well placement","Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Digital storage; Dissolution; Enhanced recovery; Injection (oil wells); Mass transfer; Water injection; Carbonated waters; CO2 storage; Local pressures; Oil recoveries; Well placement; Secondary recovery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065414944

The fabricated Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites crystalline phase, characterization, composition and morphology of the coatings were examined by various spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR (Fourier Transform Infra-Red), XRD (X-Ray Diffraction), FESEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron microscopy), EDX (Energy Dispersive X-Ray), HRTEM (High Resolution Transmission Electron microscopy), BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) and UV–Vis DRS (Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy). The corrosion resistance of the films was evaluated by using open circuit potential (OCP), potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical frequency modulation (EFM) techniques. Quantum chemical computations at the DFT level were also performed on Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites with different Ag doping concentrations. The results evidenced that the thin film coating based on Ag/TiO2 nanocomposite at a concertation of Ag (5 wt%) exhibited the best performance as a coating system for carbon steel electrode compared with other thin films at different doping concentrations as well as the uncoated surface. Also, increasing the layer thickness of Ag/TiO2 nanocomposite thin films, co-dopant content in the coating systems and the nature of TiO2 crystalline phases affect the corrosion protection ability. AFM micrographs showed the formation of protective multilayer of different Ag/TiO2 thin films on the surface of carbon steel. The results from theoretical calculations revealed a significant decrease in the energy-band gap of Ag-doped TiO2 at an optimal doping concentration of 5% as a result of the overlap between the Ag &amp; Ti states, which promotes the corrosion resistance of Ag-TiO2 thin films on the metal surface which agrees well with the experimental results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","AFM; Carbon steel corrosion; DFT; Electrochemical measurements; Sol-gel; Spin coating; Thin film","Carbon films; Carbon steel; Corrosion resistance; Crystalline materials; Design for testability; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Energy gap; Fabrication; Field emission microscopes; Film preparation; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Morphology; Multilayer films; Multilayers; Nanocomposite films; Nanocomposites; Quantum chemistry; Scanning electron microscopy; Semiconductor doping; Silver; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Spin coating; Steel corrosion; Thin films; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; Electrochemical measurements; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Fourier transform infra reds; Nanocomposite thin films; Quantum chemical approach; Quantum chemical computations; Theoretical calculations; Corrosion resistant coatings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068142994

However, removing forest harvesting residues may cause important nutrient losses. Because negative effects of increased nutrient removal are not systematic, forest managers need tools for soil sensitivity assessment, to decide whether they can or not increase biomass harvesting without impairing long term forest productivity and health. This study follows two goals: (i) define forest ecosystem sensitivity indicators derived from soil physico-chemical analyses and (ii) build and test a simplified tool that predicts such soil sensitivity. After screening international literature, nutrient concentration in the topsoil was chosen as the simplest and currently most accurate indicator of soil sensitivity. With a consolidated database on French forest soils, we built diagnostic keys that predict soil sensitivity using only five parameters: humus form, topsoil texture, depth of CaCO3 apparition, ecological region, and rooting depth. We performed a statistical evaluation of the simplified tool on independent data sets and evaluated it in the field with potential users. As compared with the existing French forest soils sensitivity indicator, our diagnosis tool displayed lower high and low sensitivities classification errors and allowed to differentiate sensitivity into five elemental ones (Ca, Mg, K, P and N).

Herein, we demonstrate that a unique N-doped graphitic carbon-encapsulated iron nanoparticles can be utilized as a promising NRR electrocatalyst. The resulting Fe(20%)@N–C achieves a better nitrate removal proportion of 83.0% (attained in the first running cycle) compared to the efficiencies of other reference catalysts, including those with lower entrapped Fe content. The nitrogen selectivity is 25.0% in the absence of Cl− and increases to 100% when supplemented with 1.0 g L−1 NaCl. More importantly, there is no statistically significant difference (at a 95% confidence interval) regarding the removal percentage recorded over 20 cycles for the Fe(20%)@N–C cathode. We propose that the iron nanoparticles could attenuate the work function on the neighboring carbon atoms, which are the reactive sites for NRR, and that the graphitic shells hinder the access of the electrolyte, thus protecting the iron particles from dissolution and oxidation. Testing with the real industrial wastewater further demonstrates the superiority of Fe(20%)@N–C cathode towards NRR, as evidenced by efficient removal of nitrate available in the biological effluent from a local coking wastewater treatment plant. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coking wastewater; Electrochemical nitrate reduction; Industrial wastewater treatment; Nitrogen selectivity; Porous carbon-encapsulated iron nanoparticles","Biological water treatment; Cathodes; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Doping (additives); Effluent treatment; Effluents; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytes; Industrial water treatment; Iron; Nanoparticles; Nitrates; Porous materials; Reduction; Sodium chloride; Wastewater treatment; Coking wastewater; Industrial wastewater treatment; Iron nanoparticles; Nitrate reduction; Nitrogen selectivity; Nitrogen removal; carbon; chloride; iron nanoparticle; nitrate; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; activated carbon; catalyst; chemical reaction; durability; electrical method; electrochemical method; energy efficiency; industrial waste; nanoparticle; nitrate; nitrogen; reduction; wastewater treatment; adsorption; Article; catalyst; chemical reaction kinetics; chemical structure; dissolution; electrochemical analysis; electrolysis; nanoencapsulation; oxidation; physical chemistry; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); scanning electron microscopy; waste water management; catalysis; Carbon; Catalysis; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066929851

Its carbon emissions, which result from the long heating period and considerable consumption of coal in residential buildings during operation, must be reduced. To this end, the long-range energy alternatives planning system was adopted for the forecasting of carbon emissions in baseline scenarios, energy-saving, energy-saving-low-carbon, and low-carbon. On the basis of these predictions, the contributions of heating, cooling, cooking, illumination, washing, and other activities to carbon emissions were analyzed. The influencing factors in the reduction of carbon emissions from residential buildings in a cold region were identified. The results showed that energy-saving-low-carbon was the optimal scenario to reduce carbon emissions. Meanwhile, carbon emissions will peak in 2030, with a value of 42.06 Mt under the same scenario. As the top three influencing factors, heating, cooling, and cooking contribute 55.74%, 18.86%, and 17.29% of carbon emissions, respectively. Sensitivity results showed the differential effects of 32 factors on the reduction of carbon emissions in residential buildings. Carbon emissions could be reduced by 17.41%, 35.51%, 31.10%, and 14.10% by controlling the building scale, heating, cooling, and cooking, respectively. To this end, seven factors, including the rationing of central heating, were identified. Then, pathways to reducing carbon emissions were proposed under different scenarios. The present research fills the gap between reality and the predicted pathway, considering the heterogeneity of the climate. © 2019 by the authors.","Building; Cold region; Jilin Province; Long-energy alternatives planning (LEAP) system; Reducing carbon emission; Terminal energy use","building; carbon emission; coal combustion; cold region; emission control; heterogeneity; operations technology; planning practice; prediction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071964374

Although China’s cement output reached its peak in 2014, regions, i.e., Fujian and Yunnan provinces, were no peaking until 2016. At the same time, rare studies referred to China’s cement consumption and CO2 emissions from the perspective of cement consumption at the provincial level. We developed the S-Logistic, polynomial model, and ARIMA model to study the peaking time of cement consumption at the provincial level, and we also projected China’s cement consumption and CO2 emissions toward 2030. Meanwhile, the discrepancies of peaking time and cumulative cement consumption per capita (CCCPC) among provinces were also studied based on GDP per capita and urbanization rate (UR). The results are that the CCCPC respectively in the range of 22–34 ton, 18–25 ton, and 17–27 ton in the eastern, intermediate, and western zone when cement consumption reached its peak. We draw the following conclusions that the CCCPC in 2030 could reach ~ 43 ton and the projected cement consumption is ~ 1252.72 Mt, which accounts for 50% of that in 2017, and cement CO2 emissions are at the range of 488.19–510.90 MtCO2 in 2030. Furthermore, capacity replacement, controlling new capacity and eliminating backward capacity are significant of greenhouse gas emission reduction not only for China, but also for the global cement industry. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CCCPC; Cement; China; CO2; Peak; Provincial level","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cement (construction material); environmental economics; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; multivariate analysis; statistical analysis; urbanization; China; Fujian; Yunnan; carbon dioxide; analysis; building material; chemistry; China; urbanization; Carbon Dioxide; China; Construction Materials; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073184591

However, there is typically little if any coordination between the district developers and the local utility. Most attention is paid to the district's annual net load and generation without considering their instantaneous imbalance or the connecting network's state. This presents an opportunity to learn lessons from the design of distribution feeders for districts characterized by low loads and high penetrations of DERs that can be applied to the distribution grid at large. The aim of this overview is to summarize current practices in sustainable district planning as well as advances in modeling and design tools for incorporating the power distribution system into the district planning process. Recent developments in the modeling and optimization of district power systems, including their coordination with multi-energy systems and the impact of high penetration levels of renewable energy, are introduced. Sustainable districts in England and Japan are reviewed as case studies to illustrate the extent to which distribution system planning has been considered in practice. Finally, newly developed building-to-grid modeling tools that can facilitate coordinated district and power system design with utility involvement are introduced, along with suggestions for future research directions.

In this study, we cultivated a Cr(VI)-reducing biofilm in a methane (CH4)-based membrane biofilm batch reactor (MBBR) under anaerobic conditions. The Cr(VI) reduction rate increased to 0.28 mg/L day when the chromate concentration was ≤ 2.2 mg/L but declined sharply to 0.01 mg/L day when the Cr(VI) concentration increased to 6 mg/L. Isotope tracing experiments showed that part of the 13C-labeled CH4 was transformed to 13CO2, suggesting that the biofilm may reduce Cr(VI) by anaerobic methane oxidation (AnMO). Microbial community analysis showed that a methanogen, i.e., Methanobacterium, dominated in the biofilm, suggesting that this genus is probably capable of carrying out AnMO. The abundance of Methylomonas, an aerobic methanotroph, decreased significantly, while Meiothermus, a potential chromate-reducing bacterium, was enriched in the biofilm. Overall, the results showed that the anaerobic environment inhibited the activity of aerobic methanotrophs while promoting AnMO bacterial enrichment, and high Cr(VI) loading reduced Cr(VI) flux by inhibiting the methane oxidation process. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","AnMO; Chromate; Methane; Remediation","anoxic conditions; biofilm; bioreactor; bioremediation; chromate; chromium; concentration (composition); membrane; methane; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial ecology; oxidation; redox conditions; Bacteria (microorganisms); Meiothermus; Methanobacterium; Methylomonas; carbon dioxide; chromic acid; methane; anaerobic growth; biofilm; bioreactor; chemistry; devices; genetics; metabolism; Methanobacterium; Methylomonas; microbial consortium; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; physiology; procedures; sewage; Anaerobiosis; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Carbon Dioxide; Chromates; Methane; Methanobacterium; Methylomonas; Microbial Consortia; Oxidation-Reduction; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068822073

A number of WtE technologies are being developed. However, selecting a more environmentally sustainable option is difficult due to data limitation and methodological inconsistencies. Using life cycle assessment (LCA) as a tool, this paper aims to identify key factors influencing the potential environmental impacts of four representative WtE technologies, namely the incineration (S1), pyrolysis (S2), gasification (S3), and gasification coupled with ash melting (S4). The systems are constructed using inventory data based on on-site operation of several industrial-scale reference plants. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is conducted, assessing a range of critical input parameters, processes, operating conditions and modelling assumptions. The results demonstrate that all analysed WtE systems exhibit environmental benefits (i.e. negative environmental impacts) for most of the impacts, while S3 seems to be more optimal due to an intermediate syngas cleaning process, which results in both reduced emissions and increased energy recovery. Parameters driving the environmental impacts are energy recovery efficiency, feedstock variability, NOx and CO2 emissions at stack, and recycling of metals. Moreover, the overall ranking of different WtE systems is strongly dependent on operating conditions, such as effectiveness of the air pollution control process, utilization pathway of pyrolysis char, and to a lesser extent, bottom ash management (landfill or recycling). The LCA modelling conditions, such as substituted source of electricity, choice of functional unit and time frame are also shown to significantly affect the quantified environmental performance. Finally, the study highlights the directions, towards which, efforts should be focused throughout all stages of each WtE technology to obtain further improvements. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy conversion technologies; Energy recovery; Environmental impacts; Life cycle assessment; Optimization; Waste-to-Energy","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Ash handling; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Gasification; Life cycle; Metal recovery; Optimization; Pyrolysis; Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Waste incineration; Energy conversion technologies; Energy recovery; Energy recovery efficiency; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Municipal solid waste (MSW); Waste to energy; Waste to energy technologies; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067311123

Here we present the analysis of an unprecedented and comprehensive dataset integrating up to 56 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from ambient sites and emission sources. VOCs were collected on multi-sorbent tubes in the coastal city of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, in winter and summer 2016 and later analysed by gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization and mass spectrometer detectors (GC-FID and GC-MS) at the laboratory. The comparison between VOC emission source profiles and ambient profiles suggests the substantial impact of two-stroke motorized two-wheel vehicles and domestic fires on the composition of Abidjan's atmosphere. However, despite high VOC concentrations near-source, moderate ambient levels were observed (by factors of 10 to 4000 lower), similar to the concentrations observed in northern mid-latitude urban areas. Besides photochemistry, the reported high wind speeds seem to be an essential factor that regulates air pollution levels in Abidjan. Emission ratios (ΔVOC/CO) were established based on real-world measurements achieved for a selected number of representative combustion sources. Maximum measured molar mass emissions were observed from two-wheel vehicles, surpassing other regional sources by 2 orders of magnitude. Local practices like waste burning also make a significant contribution to VOC emissions, higher than those from light-duty vehicles by 1.5 to 8 orders of magnitude. These sources also largely govern the VOC's atmospheric impacts in terms of OH reactivity, secondary organic aerosol formation (SOAP), and photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP). While the contribution of aromatics dominates the atmospheric impact, our measurements reveal the systematic presence of anthropogenic terpenoids in all residential combustion sectors. Finally, emission factors were used to retrieve and quantify VOC emissions from the main anthropogenic source sectors at the national level. Our detailed estimation of VOC emissions suggests that the road transport sector is the dominant source in Côte d'Ivoire, emitting around 1200Gg yr-1 of gas-phase VOCs. These new estimates are 100 and 160 times larger than global inventory estimations from MACCity or EDGAR (v4.3.2), respectively. Additionally, the residential sector is largely underestimated in the global emission inventories, by factors of 13 to 43. Considering only Côte d'Ivoire, these new estimates for VOCs are 3 to 6 times higher than the whole of Europe. Given the significant underestimation of VOC emissions from the transport and residential sectors in Côte d'Ivoire, there is an urgent need to build more realistic and region-specific emission inventories for the entire West African region. This might be true not only for VOCs, but also for all atmospheric pollutants. The lack of waste burning, wood fuel burning and charcoal burning, and fabrication representation in regional inventories also needs to be addressed, particularly in low-income areas where these types of activities are ubiquitous sources of VOC emissions. © Author(s) 2019.",,"anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; urban area; volatile organic compound; Abidjan; Cote d'Ivoire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072610196

Thus, sugar fluxes mediated by SUT (sucrose transporters), MST (monosaccharide transporters) and SWEET (sugar will eventually be exported transporters) families are key determinants of crop yield and shape the microbial communities living in the soil. In this work, we performed a systematic search for sugar transporters in Fabaceae genomes, focusing on model and agronomical plants. Here, we update the inventory of sugar transporter families mining the latest version of the Medicago truncatula genome and identify for the first time SUT MST and SWEET families of the agricultural crop Pisum sativum. The sugar transporter families of these Fabaceae species comprise respectively 7 MtSUT 7 PsSUT, 72 MtMST 59 PsMST and 26 MtSWEET 22 PsSWEET. Our comprehensive phylogenetic analysis sets a milestone for the scientific community, as we propose a new and simple nomenclature to correctly name SUT MST and SWEET families. Then, we searched for transcriptomic data available for our gene repertoire. We show that several clusters of homologous genes are co-expressed in different organs, suggesting that orthologous sugar transporters may have a conserved function. We focused our analysis on gene candidates that may be involved in remobilizing resources during flowering, grain filling and in allocating carbon towards roots colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Rhizobia. Our findings open new perspectives for agroecological applications in legume crops, as for instance improving the yield and quality of seed productions and promoting the use of symbiotic microorganisms. © 2019 Doidy et al.

This overdraft is predominantly driven by the economic value of water for agricultural production and cities. Spurred by the recent drought, California passed legislation requiring the elimination of groundwater overdraft by 2040. This paper employs a statewide hydroeconomic optimization model to explore potential water supply effects of ending long-term groundwater overdraft in California's Central Valley for several general water policies with historical and warmer-drier climates. The model minimizes agricultural, urban scarcity, and operating costs over 82 years of historical hydrologic variability, given today's infrastructure and environmental flow constraints. The model results assess effects of overdraft and Delta policies for different climates on water deliveries, economic costs, environmental flows, water market operations, and the economic value of expanding infrastructure capacities. Prohibiting long-term overdraft leads to reduced agricultural water use and reoperations, and reduced outflows to the sea from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where water availability policies become important. In combination with a warmer-drier climate, ending overdraft further exacerbates water scarcities, increases environmental and economic costs, and increases the marginal economic value of water exports from the Delta, which are likely to worsen water conflicts and illustrate connections of California's groundwater and surface water problems. Economically useful adaptation actions include more water transfers involving the Delta, water markets, and trades; conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater; and recycled wastewater supplies for coastal urban users. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Adaptation; Hydroeconomic modeling; Overdraft; Water management","Agriculture; Climate models; Commerce; Groundwater; Operating costs; Surface waters; Water management; Water supply; Adaptation; Agricultural productions; Agricultural water use; Economic value of water; Hydro-economic optimizations; Overdraft; Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta; Surface water and groundwaters; Costs; adaptation; groundwater resource; numerical model; water economics; water management; water planning; water supply; California; Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068205285

Particular attention is given to the real-world emissions, i.e. to the emissions achieved in the real driving conditions, outside of a controlled testing environment. In this framework, interest in vehicle fleet electrification is rapidly growing, as it is seen as a way to simultaneously reduce pollutant and GHG emissions, while on the other hand OEMs are facing a significant increase in the number of tests which are needed to calibrate this new generation of electrified powertrains over a variety of different driving scenarios. This paper introduces an integrated and standardized methodology for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) testing and modelling, which reduces the testing effort in terms of time and cost, and aims to provide a ""virtual test rig"" on which the performance of electrified powertrains can be assessed over a wide variety of different real driving scenarios. The experimental part is based on performing customized and non-invasive powertrain instrumentation. Vehicle tear-down is avoided for components characterization, which is instead achieved via a limited set of dedicated tests: Constant speed driving, accelerations, standstill starts and different type of decelerations are carried out to extract a sufficient amount of data to feed the simulation models. On the simulation side, the authors have developed and calibrated a comprehensive 0D map-based HEV model, capable of simulating various hybrid architectures with high flexibility also in real driving scenarios. This approach does not require a detailed knowledge of all the powertrain and vehicle components and can be used as a virtual test bench for preliminary assessments regarding various operating conditions and driving cycles. As test case, a P0-P2 architecture gasoline Plug-in HEV has been investigated: In this case the Energy Management System (EMS) plays a crucial role in targeting the optimal power split between different on board energy sources. Using literature data and tests under both steady-state and transient conditions, the EMS model was calibrated. As a result, energy consumption and operating modes are accurately predicted, thus demonstrating the capabilities of the proposed methodology to provide a virtual test rig which can be used in the predevelopment phase of new powertrains. © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

The United Nations Sustainable Energy for All initiative and Sustainable Development Goal number seven seek to provide universal modern energy for all by 2030. However, the implications of these global goals on Nigeria's energy system have not been well researched in the literature. In this study, we applied the Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning Systems model to analyse the impacts of different energy access scenarios by 2030 on household energy consumption, CO2 emissions and local air pollutant emissions. We also analysed different scenarios for biomass renewability in order to understand its impact on household net CO2 emissions. We found that achieving a 100% modern energy access by 2030 would reduce final energy demand by around 845 PJ, which is equivalent to a 52.4% reduction when compared to the baseline scenario. A 100% modern access would also significantly reduce local air pollutants, but increase CO2 emissions significantly by 16.7 MtCO2 compared to the baseline scenario. Our analysis shows that the benefits of modern energy access have been limited in Nigeria due to poor financing and low income levels of households. Therefore, we argue that for a 100% modern energy access in Nigeria by 2030, there is a need to explore local and foreign funding sources, and a serious need to couple energy access programs in the country with income-generating activities. © 2019 by the authors.","Energy access; Energy policy; Household; LEAP; Nigeria; SDG 7",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072540442

Long-term measurements of PM2.5 and the precursors and chemical speciation are crucially important for evaluating the efficiency of emission control, understanding formation and transport of PM2.5 associated with the change of meteorology, and accessing the impact of human activities on regional climate change. Here we reported long-term continuous measurements of PM2.5, chemical components, and their precursors at a regional background station, the Station for Observing Regional Processes of the Earth System (SORPES), in Nanjing, eastern China, since 2011. We found that PM2.5 at the station has experienced a substantial decrease (-9.1%yr-1), accompanied by even a very significant reduction of SO2 (-16.7%yr-1), since the national ""Ten Measures of Air"" took action in 2013. Control of open biomass burning and fossil-fuel combustion are the two dominant factors that influence the PM2.5 reduction in early summer and winter, respectively. In the cold season (November-January), the nitrate fraction was significantly increased, especially when air masses were transported from the north. More NH3 available from a substantial reduction of SO2 and increased oxidization capacity are the main factors for the enhanced nitrate formation. The changes of year-to-year meteorology have contributed to 24% of the PM2.5 decrease since 2013.

Therefore, in order to improve knowledge of these Mediterranean biotopes, we examined the dependence of the fringes of hygrophilous communities surrounding the water-bodies (green fringes) on their hydrological and geomorphological features. The climate of the western sector of this massif is cryo-oromediterranean, where thawing produces 53 hm3 of run-off and 11 hm3 of sub-surface flow. Part of this water is stored in 123 water-bodies located from 2480 to 3200 m a.s.l., 72 of which (58%) are located on the south-facing Mediterranean watershed. The total surface of the water sheet is approximately 170,000 m2, and volume is approximately 215,000 m3, of which 140,000 m3 (65%) are stored in the south-facing water-bodies. Green fringes surrounding 84 water-bodies have a total surface area of approximately 186,000 m2. Surprisingly, the more xeric Mediterranean watershed holds 58 such fringes (149,000 m2, 80%) while 26 are found on the Atlantic watershed (38,000 m2, 20%). Green fringes are mainly associated with small water-bodies (&lt;5000 m3), which occupy 148,000 m2 on the Mediterranean watershed, while on the Atlantic side, green fringes occupy 31,000 m2. Sierra Nevada also has 46 times higher water-efficiency in the smaller water-bodies than in the large ones; 16.4 and 335.8 times higher on the Atlantic and Mediterranean watersheds, respectively.

Oxygen storage phenomena characterize the catalytic converter efficiency under real world driving operating conditions and, consequently, during strong dynamics in Air-to-Fuel ratio (AFR). A numerical ""quasi-steady"" model has been set-up to simulate the chemical process inside the reactor. A dedicated experimental campaign has been performed in order to evaluate the catalyst response to a defined λ variation, thus providing the data necessary for the numerical model validation. In fact, goal of the present research activity was to investigate the effect of very fast composition transitions of the engine exhaust typical of the mentioned driving conditions (including fuel cutoffs etc.) on the catalyst performance and on related emissions. A surface reactions kinetic mechanism, representing CH4, CO, H2 oxidation and NO reduction, has been appropriately calibrated in steady-state operation, using a step-by-step procedure all over the engine operating conditions at different AFRs. Then transient conditions were numerically reproduced, through cyclical and consecutive transitions of variable frequency between rich and lean phases. The model includes a proper calibration of the reactions involving Cerium inside the catalyst, in order to reproduce oxygen storage and oxygen release dynamics. Monitoring the reaction rates of the adopted mechanism permitted to evaluate their impact on the exhaust stream composition in several operating conditions. The proposed model predicts tailpipe conversion/formation of the main chemical species starting from experimental engine-out data and provides a useful tool for evaluation of the catalyst performance. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

The latest technology advancements on the after-treatment systems have permitted to achieve very low emission conformity factors over the RDE, and therefore, the biggest challenge of the diesel engine development is maintaining its competitiveness in the trade-off ""CO2-system cost"" in comparison to other propulsion systems. In this regard, diesel engines can continue to play an important role, in the short-medium term, to enable cost-effective compliance of CO2-fleet emission targets, either in conventional or hybrid propulsion systems configuration. This is especially true for large-size cars, SUVs and light commercial vehicles. In this framework, a comprehensive approach covering the whole powertrain is of primary importance in order to simultaneously meet the performance, efficiency, noise and emission targets, and therefore, further development of the combustion system design and injection system represent important levers for additional improvements. For this purpose, a dedicated 0.5 dm3 single-cylinder engine has been developed and equipped with, a state-of-the-art Euro 6 combustion system, and an advanced common rail fuel injection system (FIS) offering higher flexibility in terms of injection strategy and higher quantity accuracy. Three injector nozzles with different hydraulic flow rates (HF) have been selected and employed for the overall combustion process optimization. The optimization has been performed by means of an extensive DoE-based test campaign in which the engine and FIS operating parameters have been parametrized with the aim to carry out a proper combination in terms of HF and injection strategy. The results at partial load conditions evidence significant advantages in applying an advanced injection pattern, while the HF reduction can significantly improve the smoke emission and combustion noise without fuel consumption penalties. Therefore, a proper combination and optimization of the HF and injection strategy can provide low noise and engine-out smoke while maintaining the rated power performance targets. © © 2019 SAE International; General Motors LLC.

In 2008 the US Embassy in Beijing started monitoring PM2.5 on the embassy premises to provide US citizens in the area with actionable health information related to ambient air pollution. By May 2019 the United States Department of State ambient air quality monitoring network had expanded to 43 cities in 27 countries. This provided a reliable source of near-real-time PM2.5 data to fill data gaps in previously under-served countries. This manuscript describes data analyses of seasonal, diurnal and meteorological trends which can be used for air quality planning and awareness in 29 of the embassies host cities. People living, working, traveling or considering relocating to those areas can gain a better understanding of the air quality they are exposed to. Potential explanations are offered for sites that deviate from expected trends: Addis Ababa experiences high PM2.5 during the rainy season probably due to widespread biomass burning and light winds; Manama has high PM2.5 throughout the day on summer weekends because widespread air conditioner usage causes coal-fired power plants to operate at high capacity to meet the electricity demand; Pristina experienced very high PM2.5 during winter weekend nights, which turned out to be very cold and stagnant periods and likely increased wood and coal combustion for home heating. Although Chinese sites consistently exceed the country's annual PM2.5 standards, analysis of long term trends confirm steady improvements in air quality. These improvements cannot be attributed to favorable meteorological conditions alone and are likely due to reductions of emissions. Since random forest-based machine learning methods explained &gt;90% of the variability in PM2.5 concentrations at 21 locations, they can be used in conjunction with meteorological models for air quality forecasting. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Data gaps; International air quality; Machine learning; PM2.5; Random forest; State department","Air conditioning; Coal; Coal combustion; Decision trees; Fossil fuel power plants; Learning systems; Machine learning; Quality control; Air quality forecasting; Data gap; Fine particulate matter; Machine learning methods; Meteorological condition; PM2.5; Random forests; State departments; Air quality; aerodynamics; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; coal combustion; electricity generation; machine learning; particulate matter; random walk method; aerosol; agriculture; air analysis; air monitoring; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; air quality standard; air temperature; ambient air; Article; atmospheric dispersion; biomass; combustion; cooking; electric power plant; heating; meteorology; motor vehicle; particulate matter; priority journal; random forest; seasonal variation; secondary organic aerosol; United States; wind speed; Addis Ababa; Bahrain; Beijing [China]; China; Ethiopia; Kosovo; Manama; Pristina; United States; Pristina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067301787

In this paper, we analyse early Miocene vegetation and climate using leaf records, palynological assemblages, and fossil wood at 36 localities from western and central Turkey, most of which have precise age control based on radiometric dating and mammal faunal ages. Using the leaf flora of Güvem (Beş Konak, Keseköy), Climate Leaf-Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) analyses and Köppen signatures were employed to infer a palaeoclimate typical of modern laurel forest regions. Based on the palynological records, abundance of various pollen-taxa was used as a measure of openness of vegetation and regional presence of major tree taxa. Most pollen floras are dominated by tree pollen (ranging from 85 to 98%) and indicated widespread afforestation. In the pollen diagrams, shifts in dominance from swamp forest elements (Taxodioideae) to well-drained forests (Pinaceae) indicate changes in lake levels or phases of basin development. Such shifts may have been associated with the development of more xeric forest vegetation. Wood anatomical features such as false tree rings further may indicate seasonal climate. Pollen diagrams and macrofossils reflect zonal and azonal broadleaf and needleleaf forest and extrazonal open vegetation. The latter occurred in areas with shallow soils on volcanic rocks or limestone (e.g. cycads, Dracaena), or coastal areas (herb dominance). Taxonomic composition and biogeographic affinities suggest laurel forest as a major forest biome on well-drained soils and ecotones between laurel forest and broadleaf deciduous forest biomes. A comparison with younger floras shows that these are neither more diverse nor more warmth-loving despite an increase in global temperature (Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum) suggesting bottlenecks during previous (Oligocene) cooler times for warmth-loving taxa. © 2019 The Authors","Aquitanian; Burdigalian; CLAMP; Köppen signatures; Laurel Forest Biome; Miocene climate","biome; Burdigalian; coniferous forest; deciduous forest; fossil assemblage; fossil record; leaf; Miocene; Oligocene; paleoclimate; paleogeography; palynology; Paratethys; pollen; swamp forest; vegetation type; wood; Anatolia; Mediterranean Region; Turkey; Cycadopsida; Mammalia; Pinaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067019003

The model is a modification of the Bracht-Flyr et al. method that was initially proposed for natural lakes in closed basins with no superficial discharge outside the basin (Qd = 0) and under water-limited environmental conditions (mean annual ratio of potential/reference evapotranspiration (ETo) versus rainfall (P) greater than 1). In the proposed modified approach, an additional Qd function is included. The modified model is applied using as a case study the Oreastiada Lake, which is located inside the Kastoria basin in Greece. Six years of observed data of P, ETo, Qd, and lake topography were used to calibrate the modified model based on the current conditions. The calibrated model was also used to assess the future lake conditions based on the future climatic projections (mean conditions of 2061-2080) derived by 19 general circulation models (GCMs) for three cases of climate change (three cases of Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The modified method can be used as a diagnostic tool in water-limited environments for analyzing the superficial discharge changes of LRs under different climatic conditions and to support the design of new management strategies for mitigating the impact of climate change on (a) flooding conditions, (b) hydroelectric production, (c) irrigation/industrial/domestic use and (d) minimum ecological flows to downstream rivers. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; General circulation model; Hydroclimatic vulnerability; Lake/reservoir hydrology; Regulated superficial discharge; Steady-state conditions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072635020

This study develops the model, validates it against historical data, and compares its simulated MEFs against historically derived regression-based MEFs. Our method accurately reproduces CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions for multiple U.S. NERC regions and years and enables us to analyze future scenarios that are absent from the historical data. Though historically derived regression-based MEFs are generally more accurate, our simulated MEFs provide a more nuanced picture of how clusters of low- or high-emitting power plants of similar production cost create large swings in MEFs throughout the day.

Recent studies have confirmed that the greatest challenges arise from the occurrence of plasma transients. Indeed, extensive damage of the plasma facing component (PFC) may occur during transients, with the risk of loss of coolant accidents (LOCA) that would hinder the safety of a future reactor as well as its prompt return to normal operation. Among the possible wall protection strategies, a sacrificial and micro-engineered surface made of porous tungsten (W) may promote the heat flux reduction while preventing the failure of the cooling pipe. As a preliminary step in this direction, the present study aims to investigate the possible application of W-based open cell foams as a sacrificial armor material. At first, an equivalent solid model, originally validated for Al open cell foams, was transferred to W foams. Then, a steady state thermal FEM analysis was carried out to evaluate the equivalent thermal conductivity provided by several foam configurations. Ultimately, a scaling law of the thermal response was developed as a function of the most influential foam parameters. As a future outlook with respect to DEMO-relevant transients scenarios, the scaling law will support design optimization and tailoring of an advanced FW PFC provided with a sacrificial W foam armor. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DEMO; FEM analysis; Heat load; Open-cell foam; Plasma facing components; Protection strategy","Armor; Facings; Heat flux; Thermal conductivity; Thermal load; DEMO; FEM analysis; Open-cell foams; Plasma-facing components; Protection strategy; Loss of coolant accidents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062919255

Using the static chamber technique, we measured CH4 flux at the soil-atmosphere interface (SAI) and estimated its diffusivity (DsCH4) in a plantation of mixed deciduous species during a year. Methane diffusivity (DsCH4) was determined through two in situ techniques (Fick's Law -FL- and SF6 methods) and a particular soil parameter model (SP method). Mean CH4 oxidation was 15.61 ± 6.39 ng CH4/m2/s and varied significantly among seasons, coinciding with variation in soil water content (W%) (R = −0.8697, p = 5 × 10−4). CH4 diffusivity presented mean values of 0.0151 ± 0.0085 cm2/s and 0.0173 ± 0.0070 cm2/s for SP and FL methods respectively, and 0.0222 ± 0.0093 cm2/s for SF6 method, with a statistically significant difference from the other two (p &lt; 0.05). For the three methods, temporal variation in CH4 diffusion exhibited the same response as CH4 oxidation and a good negative linear correlation was found between W% and DsCH4 (p &lt; 0.01). Results suggest that Fick's Law could be used for a first estimation of CH4 oxidation and that, in this temperate region, SP is the most appropriate method to obtain a first approximate measure of DsCH4 (R = 0.83, p = 0.001). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","In situ technique; Methane diffusivity; Methane oxidation; Soil parameter model; Soil parameters; Soil water content",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067196313

In this study we investigate the internal climate dynamics of the ACO over the last 21 millennia using stable water isotopes frozen in ice cores from 11 Antarctic drill sites as temperature proxies. Spectral and time series analyses reveal that ACOs occurred at all 11 sites over all time periods evaluated, suggesting that the ACO encompasses all of Antarctica. From the Last Glacial Maximum through the Last Glacial Termination (LGT), ACO cycles propagated on a multicentennial time scale from the East Antarctic coastline clockwise around Antarctica in the streamline of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The velocity of teleconnection (VT) is correlated with the geophysical characteristics of drill sites, including distance from the ocean and temperature. During the LGT, the VT to coastal sites doubled while the VT to inland sites decreased fourfold, correlated with increasing solar insolation at 65°N. These results implicate two interdependent mechanisms of teleconnection, oceanic and atmospheric, and suggest possible physical mechanisms for each. During the warmer Holocene, ACOs arrived synchronously at all drill sites examined, suggesting that the VT increased with temperature. Backward extrapolation of ACO propagation direction and velocity places its estimated geographic origin in the Southern Ocean east of Antarctica, in the region of the strongest sustained surface wind stress over any body of ocean water on Earth. ACO period is correlated with all major cycle parameters except cycle symmetry, consistent with a forced, undamped oscillation in which the driving energy affects all major cycle metrics. Cycle period and symmetry are not discernibly different for the ACO and AAO over the same time periods, suggesting that they are the same climate cycle. We postulate that the ACO/AAO is generated by relaxation oscillation of WesterlyWind velocity forced by the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and propagated regionally by identified air-sea-ice interactions. © 2019 by the authors.","Antarctic Circumpolar Current; Antarctic Circumpolar Vortex; Antarctic drill sites; Antarctic Oscillation; Anthropogenic global warming; Climate policy; Holocene; Ice cores; Last Glacial Maximum; Last Glacial Termination; Natural climate cycle; Natural global warming; Relaxation oscillation; Southern Annular Mode; Stable isotope temperature proxies; Teleconnection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073238096

Using individual utility-level data between 2007 and 2011 from the US Energy Information Administration on energy efficiency spending and other utility characteristics I find that decoupled utilities spend, on average, about $16 per customer more on energy efficiency than utilities that have not been decoupled. Therefore, given the increasing importance of energy efficiency as an effective way to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and an ongoing increase in different regulatory environments of electric utilities, it appears that decoupling policies may be effective instruments to promote energy efficiency spending. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Demand-side management; Difference-in-differences; Investor-owned electric utilities; Revenue decoupling","Demand side management; Economics; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Greenhouse gases; Difference-in-differences; Energy Information Administration; Regulatory environment; Utility companies; Energy efficiency; demand-side management; electricity industry; energy efficiency; energy policy; investment; regulatory approach; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066049877

Moreover, the dependence on diesel and its associated costs are an economic problem for these communities, particularly in the Canadian Arctic, where governments subsidize this fuel. Thus, this article presents specific studies including new variable-speed generator (VSG) technologies that demonstrate the feasibility, impact, and benefits of introducing renewable energy (RE) together with VSGs in remote microgrids in the Canadian Arctic. More specifically, this article describes a two-step procedure to select remote communities for detailed feasibility studies of deployment of RE sources, including a generation expansion planning (GEP) framework and optimization model for RE and new VSG integration applied to the selected communities, to minimize diesel dependence of isolated microgrids and maximize the incorporation of environmentally friendly generation technologies. The proposed approach is applied to communities in Nunavut and the North West Territories in the Canadian Arctic, based on actual data, to study the technoeconomic feasibility of RE integration and develop business cases for diesel generation replacement with RE and VSG generation in these communities. The obtained optimal plans contain diesel-RE hybrid combinations that would yield substantial economic savings and reductions on GHG emissions, which are being used as the base for actual deployments in some of the studied communities. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Canadian Arctic; diesel renewable energy (RE) hybrid; energy planning; feasibility study; generation expansion planning (GEP); greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction; Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER); optimal operation planning; prefeasibility study; RE integration; remote microgrids; variable-speed generator (VSG)","Carbon footprint; Energy resources; Expansion; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Oil spills; Planning; Canadian Arctic; Energy planning; Feasibility studies; Generation expansion planning; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Hybrid optimization; Micro grid; Optimal operation; Pre-feasibility studies; Re-integration; Renewable energies; Variable speed generators; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072214314

To summarise the results, ICT reduces the level of CO2 emissions across high- and middle-income countries; however, contrary to this, ICT increases CO2 emissions in low-income countries. Also, energy consumption is responsible for the increase in CO2 emissions in all income groups as expected. Finally, the environmental Kuznets curve is proved in all income groups.

For this new construction model, they have set a main goal to minimize the energy demands, which are a key factor in reducing carbon dioxide emissions over the whole life of the building. Specifically, the objective is to increase the envelope performance, permitting to reduce, as much as possible, the implementation and use of active heating and cooling systems. The most representative strategy to do so is the use of brick curtain wall, designed in analogy with glass curtain walls as a facade. It allows the use of thermal mass to cool the building passively during the night in summer time and it helps to ensure airtightness in the envelope to minimize air leaks. This facade is complemented with an architectonical element that produces electricity based on photovoltaic panels. Based on the energy simulation results and waiting for the actual building's construction, some relevant conclusions can be made. The role of the architecture has been crucial to ensure an optimal result, especially contributing on the reduction of the overheating hours, resulting to the minimization of the cooling energy demand. The building does not require any installation of mechanical cooling systems, even being located in the Mediterranean climate. In south orientations, the use of doubled glazing seems to be efficient enough to achieve a low energy demand, while it optimizes at the same time the total economic construction cost.

Moreover, other potential benefits that may derive, e.g. biodiversity enhancement, the reduction in buildings energy consumption, stormwater management, acoustic insulation or air purification, earned them the designation 'no-regrets approaches' for adapting to climate change. However, the lack of understanding and quantification of green infrastructures' environmental impacts prevents urban planning policies to be consistent and to turn attractive initiatives to effective implementations. The monitoring of existing green infrastructures is required to evaluate their cooling effect. For this purpose, an elastic gridshell in composite materials has been designed as a support for climbing plants at Ecole des Ponts ParisTech (Champs-sur-Marne, France). The life cycle assessment of the vegetated structure is performed in order to develop sustainable design strategies. Based on an energy balance approach, the collected thermo-hydric data can be used to determine which mechanisms are the most suitable for urban vegetation to enhance outdoor thermal comfort. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Fundamental aspects of the science, including aggregation, electrochemical rate laws, and electrode-catalyst electronic coupling, are discussed to provide a solid foundation on which to design experiments and interpret results. Mechanistic aspects of ECR are presented based on electrokinetic and spectroscopic measurements as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consensus is improving for electrokinetic measurements, but the redox state of the metal center under reaction conditions and DFT reaction pathways lack agreement in the literature. Concerning the tunable aspects of the molecular catalyst, the impacts of the metal center, ligand substituents, and electrode support on the activity and selectivity toward ECR are presented with an emphasis on those studies that controlled for aggregation and minimized mass-transport limitations. Extended three-dimensional (3D) structures such as polymers, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) are discussed as highly tunable architectures that begin to mimic the catalytic pockets of enzyme active sites. To achieve the full potential of these catalysts, design principles must emerge based on a combination of deconvoluting measurements to extract intrinsic catalyst properties and more reliable theoretical calculations to predict reaction pathways.

Here we report the synthesis and gas permeability data of a series of ultrapermeable PIMs, of two-dimensional chain conformation and based on benzotriptycene structural units, that demonstrate remarkable ideal selectivity for most gas pairs of importance. In particular, the CO2 ultrapermeability and high selectivity for CO2 over CH4, of key importance for the upgrading of natural gas and biogas, and for CO2 over N2, of importance for cost-effective carbon capture from power plants, exceed the performance of the current state-of-the-art polymers. All of the gas permeability data from this series of benzotriptycene-based PIMs are placed well above the current 2008 Robeson upper bounds for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2. Indeed, the data for some of these polymers fall into a linear correlation on the benchmark Robeson plots [i.e. log(P CO2/P CH4) versus log P CO2 and log(P CO2/P N2) versus log P CO2], which are parallel to, but significantly above, that of the 2008 CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 upper bounds, allowing their revision. The redefinition of these upper bounds sets new aspirational targets for polymer chemists to aim for and will result in more attractive parametric estimates of energy and cost efficiencies for carbon capture and natural/bio gas upgrading using state-of-the-art CO2 separation membranes. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Gas permeability; Gas plants; Gases; Microporosity; Natural gasoline plants; Natural polymers; Separation; Energy and cost; Energy efficient; High selectivity; Ideal selectivities; Industrial gas separation; Linear correlation; Polymers of intrinsic microporosities; State of the art; Gas permeable membranes; carbon dioxide; chemical compound; methane; natural gas; nitrogen; polymer; power plant; separation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072305247

In this study, we analyzed the changes in the carbon sequestration services which occurred due to the LULC changes over a 20 years period (1989-2009) in Korea where local development projects have been active, since 1990s. As a result, the total carbon stocks decreased by about 0.07 billion t C. Significant changes in the carbon stocks mostly occurred in areas where development projects were frequently implemented. The loss of economic value due to the changes in carbon stocks over 20 years was 4.7 trillion won (4159 million USD) when market price of carbon is applied. Therefore, in countries and regions where there is an active development, it is necessary to monitor the land-use changes with high carbon stocks, to reconsider the value of the carbon when making policy decisions which cause LULC changes, and to internalize social costs into the market prices. Especially at a local level, it is necessary to promote management policy based on carbon sequestration services in accordance with local conditions such as size and types of the changes in carbon stocks. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon cost; Carbon sequestration service; Carbon storage capacity; Development pressure; LULC change","carbon; carbon sequestration; cost analysis; decision analysis; development project; implementation process; land use change; market system; policy making; price dynamics; sustainability; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072608724

Similar or comparable centralized regulation instruments dedicated to controlling and limiting rather than focusing and improving N application practices exist in large parts of the OECD. Recent policy debates have exposed an array of problems relating to this type of regulation. Problems include issues of appropriate scale, transparency and failures to adapt intervention and regulation to relevant geo-ecological variations in contexts where general rules are being imposed on varied agro-ecosystems. Therefore it has been proposed to rescale regulation to better fit relevant socio-political and agro-environmental processes including the scale of farmers’ decision making, the scale of relevant hydrological systems and the scale of key agro-ecological conditions such as soil characteristics and drainage. However, the challenge of shifting the regulation to a more local scale raises a number of questions. These include (1) How information produced locally can be integrated with national scale data? (2) In what way integrated datasets can used to model environmental effects of current and possible land use patterns? (3) In what way data and estimates of consequences of land use changes are best made available in decision making processes? To address these questions this article reports on ongoing work in Denmark to develop a decision support tool for N-management at the scale of agricultural landscapes, which are areas where a similar pattern of land use is repeated across the land surface, reflecting a specific mode of adapting agriculture to natural conditions. The aim of the article is to evaluate the design of a decision support tool aiming at enabling strategic N-management at landscape scales by linking decision support at the scale of individual farms with decision support targeted at groups of farms where a coordinated effort to solve common problems may be more efficient. Design targets for the tool were established empirically based on evidence from exploratory workshops with farmers and other stakeholders in 6 case areas across Denmark. On this basis a prototype GIS-tool for capturing, storing, editing, displaying and modelling landscape scale farming practices and associated emission consequences was developed. The tool was designed to integrate locally held knowledge with national scale datasets in live scenario situations through the implementation of a flexible, uniform and editable data model for land use data – the dNmark landscape model. Based on input data that is corrected and co-authored by workshop participants, the tool estimates the effect of potential land use scenarios on nutrient emissions. The tool was tested in 5 scenario workshops in case areas in Denmark in 2016, on the basis of which its design is evaluated and discussed in this article. © 2019",,"nitrate; nitrogen; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural labor; agricultural land; agricultural management; decision making; decision support system; GIS; knowledge; land use change; landscape; modeling; agricultural land; agricultural worker; aquatic environment; Article; decision making; Denmark; environmental management; landscape ecology; pollution; watershed; agriculture; Denmark; ecosystem; Denmark; Agriculture; Decision Making; Denmark; Ecosystem; Nitrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067653360

This study assessed the potential impacts of climate change (A1B IPCC scenario), land use (local market crops vs. export crop production based on pluriannual sugarcane and banana), alternative cropping practices (reduced tillage and organic amendments)and pedoclimatic conditions on soil organic carbon (SOC)changes in the period 2015–2045. The study was carried out in the Guadeloupe archipelago, which offers a good representation of the diversity of Caribbean agriculture. Our modelling approach coupled a biophysical model of SOC dynamics with three databases accounting for land use, cropping practices and soil properties at the territory scale. The results indicated that cropping practices and land use were more important than climate change and pedoclimatic conditions in affecting SOC stocks. Despite this, in absolute terms climate change increased SOC losses at the territory scale by 29-fold, and up to 30% of these losses were linked to pluriannual sugarcane monoculture, due to the negative impact of climate change on plant growth. Most scenarios tested gave a variable degree of SOC losses (0.01−0.32% yr−1 of the initial territory SOC stock).

Despite relatively high biodiversity, the temperate forests in East Asia have lacked a comprehensive regional evaluation of potential climate change impacts. Here, we assess the level of climate change exposure of the Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests Biome of East Asia by 2070. These temperate forests occupy 18 ecoregions, five countries, and 102 provinces. We categorize climate change exposure by classifying baseline (1960–1990) climate conditions for the current geographic distribution of five temperate forest types within each ecoregion and within the biome. We then measure the level of change under four future climates: a warmer or a hotter future climate and under reduced emissions (RCP4.5) or with emissions continuing unabated (RCP8.5). By 2070, using the RCP8.5 emission scenario, 24.5–65.7% of these forests enter non-analog or the most marginal 1% of baseline climate conditions. These results reveal the need for extensive transboundary governmental coordination, including forest preservation actions among 51 of 54 provinces that will retain some forest locations in climatically stable or low-risk conditions. Furthermore, among 96 provinces with forests that will be highly exposed, 90 will require transboundary climate change adaptation strategies because these forests span their borders, including the border areas of China, the Russian Federation, and North Korea. The analytical approach of this study could serve as a template for supporting transboundary institutional coordination to address climate change. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Forestry; Geographical distribution; Adaptation strategies; Adaptive Management; Analytical approach; Climate change adaptation; Climate change impact; Emission scenario; Forest preservation; Russian federation; Climate change; adaptive management; baseline conditions; climate change; climate effect; conservation management; ecoregion; forest ecosystem; state role; temperate forest; transboundary cooperation; China; North Korea; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069209403

To date, however, there is relatively little research into the degree to which environmental features, such as reduced CO2 emissions, are considered important when reflecting on car purchase decisions using large representative samples. This issue was explored using data from wave four (2013/14) of the UK Household Longitudinal Study, weighted to be representative of the UK population (N = 12,895). Principal components analysis identified three types of considerations during car purchase reflections: Utilitarian, Image-conscious and Environmental. Logistic and Ordinary Least Squares regressions identified attitudinal, behavioural and sociodemographic predictors of reporting environmental considerations during car purchase. Consideration of environmental factors during reflections on car purchases was more likely among those with higher climate change concerns and topic engagement, as well as self-reported pro-environmental behaviours more generally. Environmental considerations were also higher amongst women, older adults, non-white ethnic groups, urban residents and among individuals in Scotland (vs. London). Contrary to previous findings, richer and more educated respondents were less likely to consider environmental factors, with income positively related to image factors such as brand. Although our findings offer some support for the pro-environmental attitude–behaviour consistency hypothesis, they also highlight key non-attitudinal, sociodemographic factors underlying car purchase reflections that may help social-marketers and policy makers identify key audiences to more effectively promote low-emission vehicle purchases. © 2019","Attitude behaviour consistency; Car purchase reflections; Climate change concern; Pro-environmental behaviours; Spillover effects","Climate change; Population statistics; Principal component analysis; Purchasing; Sales; Attitude behaviour consistency; Environmental attitudes; Environmental considerations; Ordinary least squares regressions; Principal components analysis; Pro-environmental behaviours; Socio-demographic factors; Spillover effects; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066113466

Cities, in particular, stand out as an essential governing unit with huge potentials in resolving some of the 21st century's most pressing concerns. The recent explosion of the phenomenon of city-networks reflects intensifying city-to-city interactions in addressing global environmental issues. This article examines the case of Tokyo in addressing challenges posed by climate change. Examining the origin, development, and diffusion of Tokyo's climate change policy, the cap-and-trade scheme was found to have first diffused from Europe to Tokyo, adjusted to adapt to the local context, then further diffused to other Asian cities. Study of Tokyo's experience demonstrates that policy formation does not always follow a centralized, top-down, command-and-control approach. This findings challenge conventional realist conception which emphasises the dominance of central authorities and sovereign states in global policy formation. Under the framework of global governance, this article argues that cities are important sites of policy experimentation and innovation, and that the case of Tokyo demonstrates the potential of cross-country policy diffusion. © 2019 Nikita Chiu, published by Sciendo 2019.","cities; climate change; environmental governance; global governance; Tokyo",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075037514

While our knowledge of biophysical associations between meteorological factors and disease is steadily improving, our understanding of the social processes that shape adaptation to environmental perturbations lags behind. Using computational modeling methods, we explore the ways in which social cohesion can affect adaptation of disease prevention strategies when communities are exposed to different environmental scenarios that influence transmission pathways for diseases such as diarrhea. We developed an agent-based model in which household agents can choose between two behavioral strategies that offer different levels of protection against environmentally mediated disease transmission. One behavioral strategy is initially set as more protective, leading households to adopt it widely, but its efficacy is sensitive to variable weather conditions and stressors such as floods or droughts that modify the disease transmission system. The efficacy of the second strategy is initially moderate relative to the first and is insensitive to environmental changes. We examined how social cohesion (defined as average number of household social network connections) influences health outcomes when households attempt to identify an optimal strategy by copying the behaviors of socially connected neighbors who seem to have adapted successfully in the past. Our simulation experiments suggest that high-cohesion communities are able to rapidly disseminate the initially optimal behavioral strategy compared to low-cohesion communities. This rapid and pervasive change, however, decreases behavioral diversity; i.e., once a high cohesion community settles on a strategy, most or all households adopt that behavior. Following environmental changes that reduce the efficacy of the initially optimal strategy, rendering it suboptimal relative to the alternative strategy, high-cohesion communities can fail to adapt. As a result, despite faring better early in the course of computational experiments, high-cohesion communities may ultimately experience worse outcomes. In the face of uncertainty in predicting future environmental stressors due to climate change, strategies to improve effective adaptation to optimal disease prevention strategies should balance between intervention efforts that promote protective behaviors based on current scientific understanding and the need to guard against the crystallization of inflexible norms. Developing generalizable models allows us to integrate a wide range of theories and multiple datasets pertaining to the relationship between social mechanisms and adaptation, which can provide further understanding of future climate change impacts. Models such as the one we present can generate hypotheses about the mechanisms that underlie the dynamics of adaptation events and suggest specific points of measurement to assess the impact of these mechanisms. They can be incorporated as modules within predictive simulations for specific socio-ecological contexts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive capacity; Environmental change; Infectious disease; Model; Social network; Vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; diarrheal disease; disease control; disease transmission; environmental change; infectious disease; nature-society relations; public health; social network; strategic approach; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071097414

Meanwhile, typical chemical looping partial oxidation of methane to syngas suffers from the carbon deposition and the low selectivity toward syngas. To overcome these drawbacks, the partial oxidation of methane and H2O-CO2 splitting are coupled to consist of an alternative chemical looping redox scheme for the generation of Fischer-Tropsch (F-T)-ready syngas. The usability of lattice oxygen in a redox catalyst is facilitated, and its redox property is also thermodynamically optimized by using H2O and CO2 as soft oxidants, guaranteeing an effective generation of syngas from both redox steps. The carbon tolerance is greatly enhanced due to H2O or CO2 gasification in the reoxidization step. Experimental studies confirm the redox scheme by using CeO2-LaFeO3 redox catalyst, demonstrating generation of syngas with an H2/CO molar ratio around 2.0 in both methane partial oxidation and H2O-CO2 splitting steps over 30 repeated cycles at 850 °C. A syngas selectivity of 95% in methane partial oxidation and nearly 100% conversion of CO2 to CO can be achieved. Synergistic effect and competing reaction between H2O and CO2 splittings over the reduced redox catalyst are the key factors for the control of syngas composition and the intensification of CO2 splitting. The proposed approach can potentially be applied for production of F-T-ready syngas with an increased yield without the need for gas separation when compared to the state-of-the-art thermochemical splitting or methane chemical looping partial oxidation processes. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Ceria; Chemical looping; CO2 splitting; Perovskite; Redox; Syngas","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Cerium compounds; Cerium oxide; Decomposition; Methane; Molar ratio; Oxidation; Perovskite; Synthesis gas; Chemical looping; CO2 splitting; High-temperature decomposition; Methane partial oxidation; Partial oxidation of methane; Redox; Syn-gas; Synergistic effect; Synthesis gas manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072632145

Taking Pt as an example, although numerous efforts have been made, disagreements are still unresolved regarding the potential-dependent adsorption of pyridine on the Pt electrode, which further prevents an explicit understanding of the pyridine-mediated electrochemical process at a molecular level. Here, we employed an operando electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy method, in combination with the density functional theory calculation and isotopic labeling of the molecule, to thoroughly study how pyridine interacts with the Pt electrode/electrolyte interface. For the first time, it is corroborated that pyridine is adsorbed on the Pt electrode in both pyridine molecule (Py) and α-pyridyl radical (α-Pyl) states. On the basis of a systematic investigation of the potential-dependent vibrational spectra, we further explored how the coverage, configuration, and binding strength of both Py and α-Pyl adsorbates on the Pt electrode are tuned by electrode polarization and accordingly established a structural model at the electrochemical interface. Our work not only ends the long-time disputes on how pyridine interacts with the Pt electrode but also provides crucial information for the mechanistic research of pyridine-mediated reaction process.

We adopted the structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to identify the main contributors to emissions increase in Heilongjiang province during 2002–2012, which is the heartland of Northeast revitalization. The results show that the increase in CO2 emissions was mainly driven by growth in per-capita final demand, which generated 203.8 Mt (153.6%) upstream CO2 emissions between 2002 and 2012. Changes in production structure and final demand structure had smaller impacts on CO2 emissions increase (36.1 Mt and 27.0 Mt). However, the positive influences were largely overwhelmed by change in emission intensity, which avoided 135.4 Mt (−102%) CO2 emissions. Therefore, appropriate measures related to energy structure optimization and efficiency improvement should be implemented. Especially, increasing the proportion of wind, solar and biomass energy in Heilongjiang, where renewable energy is abundant, would reduce the CO2 emissions significantly. In addition, domestic export took the lead position in driving the CO2 emissions in Heilongjiang, accounting for 37.6%–43.1% annual emissions between 2002 and 2012. Thus, some financial instrument, such as tax relief for less carbon intensive exports could be adopted to prompt upstream suppliers to decarbonize their production processes. © 2019","CO2 emissions; Heilongjiang province; Input-output model; Low-carbon transition; Structural decomposition analysis (SDA)","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Structural optimization; CO2 emissions; Heilongjiang; Input output model; Low-carbon transitions; Structural decomposition analysis (SDA); Industrial emissions; carbon; alternative energy; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; energy efficiency; environmental economics; input-output analysis; optimization; socioeconomic conditions; Article; biomass energy; carbon footprint; China; economic development; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental economics; environmental protection; financial management; low carbon transition; priority journal; renewable energy; rural area; socioeconomics; solar energy; statistical analysis; structural decomposition analysis; tax; wind power; China; Heilongjiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066040823

The longitudinal profile of a river (elevation versus distance downstream) is a key morphological attribute that reflects the history of drainage basin evolution, so its form should be diagnostic of the regional expression of climate and its interaction with the land surface5–9. However, both detecting climatic signatures in longitudinal profiles and deciphering the climatic mechanisms of their development have been challenging, owing to the lack of relevant global data and to the variable effects of tectonics, lithology, land surface properties and human activities10,11. Here we present a global dataset of 333,502 river longitudinal profiles, and use it to explore differences in overall profile shape (concavity) across climate zones. We show that river profiles are systematically straighter with increasing aridity. Through simple numerical modelling, we demonstrate that these global patterns in longitudinal profile shape can be explained by hydrological controls that reflect rainfall–runoff regimes in different climate zones. The most important of these is the downstream rate of change in streamflow, independent of the area of the drainage basin. Our results illustrate that river topography expresses a signature of aridity, suggesting that climate is a first-order control on the evolution of the drainage basin. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"rain; desert climate; Letter; priority journal; river; river basin; runoff; topography; climate; hydrology; theoretical model; Climate; Hydrology; Models, Theoretical; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072686702

To achieve the goal of sustainable recycling of biological resources and mitigation of greenhouse gases, a novel metal-free cellulose-based Schiff-base heterogeneous catalyst (Cell-2L) is reported in the ring-opening addition reaction of CO2 with epoxides to synthesize cyclic carbonates for the first time. The as-prepared samples were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller/Barrett-Joyner-Halenda, solid-state NMR, and thermogravimetric analysis analyses. The successful anchoring of nonmetal Schiff-base complex on chlorinated cellulose is evident from the structural composition studies. The catalytic activity results showed that the samples exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the solvent-free condition. The yield of resultant propylene carbonate was measured to be 98.7% with ∼100% selectivity. The enhanced role of the present catalyst for the ring-opening addition could be attributed to the synergy of its structural hydroxyl, phenolic -OH, and Lewis basic (imine) groups in the catalyst, which are capable of activating the epoxide and CO2, which efficiently participate in the reaction together with the substantial role of nucleophilic ionic (Br-) group from the co-catalyst. The catalyst was effectively reused for five consequent runs without a significant loss in the catalytic activity and showed high effectiveness for a series of other epoxides. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Addition reactions; Carbon dioxide; Cellulose; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Brunauer emmett tellers; Catalytic performance; Environmental catalysis; Fourier transform infra reds; Heterogeneous catalyst; Ring-opening addition reactions; Solvent free conditions; Structural composition; Catalyst activity; Carbon Dioxide; Cellulose; Esca; Gravimetry; Greenhouse Gases; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Thermal Analysis; X Ray Spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072645646

Detailed thermal parameters are essential for predictions using physics-based energy models, but they are not always available or sufficiently accurate. To reduce the simulation time in calibration and the dependency of accurate data of buildings, this paper develops a prediction approach using a building energy model whose parameters are calibrated by Bayesian-based calibration method to match the recorded data of monthly heat demand. In the proposed calibration approach, an emulator is established to evaluate the untested values of thermal parameters using Bayesian method, and then use the evaluation results to search for the most suitable parameters value. The designed approach greatly accelerates the calibration speed. The method is used to calibrate a single parameter and multiple parameters of the building thermal energy models for a district heating network. After it has been verified with measured data, the developed calibration method is used to calibrate parameters of building energy models. The output of the calibrated model can predict the hourly building heat demand in district heating networks. © 2019 by the authors.","Bayesian history matching; District heating network; Heat demand prediction; Parameter calibration","Bayesian networks; Buildings; Forecasting; Heating equipment; Bayesian approaches; Building energy model; District heating networks; Heat demand prediction; History matching; Multiple parameters; Parameter calibration; Thermal parameters; District heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071904460

The power sector accounts for a large percentage of air pollutants emissions and has large emission reduction potential due to its centralized emissions. In order to find a cost-effective development pathway for the power sector to realize emission reduction, a multi-regional power generation expansion planning model is proposed in this paper and China is used for a case study. The model integrates air pollutants emission constraints, multi-regional interconnected power system and hourly power scheduling. Detailed regional characteristics and Ultra-High-Voltage (UHV) power transmission lines among regions in China are included whilst the power scheduling process is incorporated on an hourly basis. The scenario analysis shows that existing actions including the planned long-distance UHV power transmission lines and the corresponding coal plants groups in resource-rich regions would significantly help to reduce emissions in load-centered regions and realize the national emission reduction target. However, building coal plants groups in resource-rich regions for power exports turns out to be pollution transfer and cause their emissions to exceed local environmental carrying capacity. Regional power generation expansion planning incorporating regional environmental carrying capacity constraints presents a solution to this problem of unbalanced regional emission reduction. The result shows that substituting 68.4 GW of planned coal plants with renewable energy power plants in resource-rich regions for power exports could control the emissions in all regions to lower than local environmental carrying capacity. © 2019","Air pollution control; Modelling and optimization; Power generation expansion planning","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Coal; Coal deposits; Cost effectiveness; Electric lines; Emission control; Expansion; Power transmission; Scheduling; UHV power transmission; Emission reduction; Emission reduction potentials; Emission reduction targets; Environmental carrying capacities; Power generation expansion planning; Regional characteristics; Renewable energy power; Ultra high voltage; Electric power system interconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066618600

On the other hand, the study of aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) helps achieve such goals because of inherent relationships between their luminescence behaviors and conformational variations that allow for the visual monitoring of the changes in the material properties. Inspired by this, in this work, three AIE isomers are fabricated in structures consisting of tetraphenylpyrazine and triphenylethene units with para-, meta-, and ortho-position linkages, respectively. The isomerism effect brings about significantly decreased luminescence efficiency, subtly blueshifted emission, basically reduced AIE effect but boosted porosity in the aggregate state as the conformation of AIEgens evolves from an extended to a folded one. Based on the distinct properties, their respective use in blue organic light-emitting diodes, nanofluorescent probes, and molecule-capturing porous crystals are investigated. This work not only achieves precise property control by using the isomerism effect of AIEgens but also provides useful information on the future design of π-conjugated materials with advanced functionalities. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These model results are compared with each other and an extensive set of measurements, aiming to evaluate the current CTMs' ability in simulating aerosol concentrations, to document the similarities and differences among model performance, and to reveal the characteristics of aerosol components in large cities over East Asia. In general, these CTMs can well reproduce the spatial-temporal distributions of aerosols in East Asia during the year 2010. The multi-model ensemble mean (MMEM) shows better performance than most single-model predictions, with correlation coefficients (between MMEM and measurements) ranging from 0.65 (nitrate, NO- 3 ) to 0.83 (PM2:5). The concentrations of black carbon (BC), sulfate (SO2- 4 ), and PM10 are underestimated by MMEM, with normalized mean biases (NMBs) of -17:0 %, -19.1 %, and -32.6 %, respectively. Positive biases are simulated for NO- 3 (NMBD4.9 %), ammonium (NHC 4 ) (NMBD14.0 %), and PM2:5 (NMBD4.4 %). In comparison with the statistics calculated from MICS-Asia phase II, frequent updates of chemical mechanisms in CTMs during recent years make the intermodel variability of simulated aerosol concentrations smaller, and better performance can be found in reproducing the temporal variations of observations. However, a large variation (about a factor of 2) in the ratios of SNA (sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium) to PM2:5 is calculated among participant models. A more intense secondary formation of SO2- 4 is simulated by Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) models, because of the higher SOR (sulfur oxidation ratio) than other models (0.51 versus 0.39). The NOR (nitric oxidation ratio) calculated by all CTMs has larger values (0:20) than the observations, indicating that overmuch NO- 3 is simulated by current models. NH3-limited condition (the mole ratio of ammonium to sulfate and nitrate is smaller than 1) can be successfully reproduced by all participant models, which indicates that a small reduction in ammonia may improve the air quality. A large coefficient of variation (CV &gt; 1.0) is calculated for simulated coarse particles, especially over arid and semi-arid regions, which means that current CTMs have difficulty producing similar dust emissions by using different dust schemes. According to the simulation results of MMEM in six large Asian cities, different air-pollution control plans should be taken due to their different major air pollutants in different seasons.

Sampling was conducted at sites with trees of varying height and configuration adjacent to a major road in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, Northwest China. The concentration of remanence-bearing ferrimagnets in the leaf samples was estimated from measurements of Saturation Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (SIRM), while the weight of particles deposited on the leaves and their elemental composition were determined at different heights and in different directions relative to the road. The PM on the surface of needles was predominantly influenced by traffic emissions and by dust resuspension. Rows of roadside trees, as opposed to solitary trees, were more effective at intercepting PM and thus in filtering road traffic pollution. The results indicate that Juniperus formosana needles may be an effective bio-sensor for monitoring variations in the spatial diffusion of road pollutants. Rows of roadside trees have a higher road pollutant retention ability than solitary trees, which reveals the important effect of tree configuration on the accumulation and diffusion of road traffic pollutants in an open road environment. © 2019","Biomagnetic monitoring; Elemental concentrations; Road pollution; Tree configuration","Diffusion; Forestry; Needles; Pollution detection; Remanence; Roadsides; Saturation magnetization; Elemental compositions; Elemental concentrations; Magnetic characteristic; Road pollutions; Saturation isothermal remanent magnetizations; Spatial diffusions; Tree configuration; Vertical direction; Air pollution; cadmium; copper; lead; zinc; concentration (composition); coniferous tree; diffusion; magnetic property; particulate matter; pollutant transport; pollution monitoring; road traffic; roadside environment; semiarid region; traffic emission; urban pollution; Article; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric diffusion; atmospheric dispersion; chemical composition; China; concentration (parameter); conifer needle; dust; elemental analysis; Juniperus; Juniperus formosana; nonhuman; particle resuspension; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; pollution transport; semiarid climate; traffic pollution; urban area; air pollutant; chemistry; diffusion; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; magnetism; particulate matter; physical phenomena; plant leaf; tree; China; Gansu; Lanzhou; Juniperus formosana; Air Pollutants; China; Diffusion; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Magnetics; Particulate Matter; Physical Phenomena; Plant Leaves; Trees; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067700899

We estimated the impacts caused by ship emissions, both on air quality and human health, in 2015 and future (2030) within the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China. In addition, we assessed the potential health benefits of implementing an Emission Control Area (ECA) in the region by predicting avoided premature mortality with and without an ECA. In 2015, ship emissions increased PM2.5 concentrations and O3 mixing ratios by 1.4 μg/m3 and 1.9 ppb, respectively, within the PRD region. This resulted in 466 and 346 excess premature acute deaths from PM2.5 and O3, respectively. Premature mortality from chronic exposures was even more significant, with 2,085 and 852 premature deaths from ship-related PM2.5 and O3, respectively. In 2030, we projected the future ship emissions with and without an ECA, using two possible land scenarios. With an ECA, we predicted 76% reductions in SO2 and 13% reductions in NOx from the shipping sector. Assuming constant land emissions from 2015 in 2030 (2030 Constant scenario), we found that an ECA could avoid 811 PM2.5-related and 108 O3-related deaths from chronic exposures. Using 2030 Projected scenario for land emissions, we found that an ECA would avoid 1,194 PM2.5-related and 160 O3-related premature deaths in 2030. In both scenarios, implementing an ECA resulted in 30% fewer PM2.5-related premature deaths and 10% fewer O3-related premature deaths, illustrating the importance of reducing ship emissions. ©2019.

The oil in such reservoirs cannot be commercially exploited using conventional oil recovery methods as the oil exists at residual oil saturation. Instead, enhanced oil recovery methods such as CO2 injection are required. Recently, ROZs have been increasingly studied as potential CO2 storage targets. In spite of increased interest in ROZs, there are significant gaps in the knowledge of parameters and processes that impact CO2 storage and oil recovery. In this work, we identify key geologic and operational characteristics that affect CO2 storage capacity and oil recovery potential by performing Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analysis. In addition to CO2 storage capacity, we also characterize the long-term CO2 fate in ROZs. The distinction of CO2 storage in ROZs from conventional oil reservoirs and saline aquifers are also characterized. Furthermore, predictive models based on machine learning techniques are developed to estimate CO2 storage and oil production potentials for ROZs. The applicability of the predictive models is demonstrated for five ROZs in the Permian Basin. © 2019","CO2 storage; Enhanced oil recovery; Machine learning; Predictive empirical models; Residual oil zones","Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Hydrogeology; Learning systems; Machine learning; Monte Carlo methods; Petroleum industry; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Predictive analytics; Sensitivity analysis; CO2 storage; Empirical model; Enhanced oil recovery; Operational characteristics; Predictive models; Residual oil; Residual oil saturation; Residual saturation; Enhanced recovery; carbon dioxide; empirical analysis; enhanced oil recovery; gas storage; long-term change; machine learning; Monte Carlo analysis; residual soil; Permian Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067854801

To understand the extreme events, the air pollution case from 9 January to 15 January 2019 was selected. The PM2.5 concentration of 34 monitoring sites which were hourly measured, the nationwide synoptic conditions at surface and 850hpa, the meteorological factors including temperature, wind speed and humidity and the vertical variation in Planetary boundary layer (PBL) during the case were analyzed. It is found that synoptic condition, meteorological factors and urban PM2.5 (fine particles with diameter less than 2.5μm) concentration distribution changed regularly with time. Clean stage, transport stage, cumulative stage and dispersion stage during haze are defined in this study. Three overall research results are: (1) The synoptic variation is distinct. Beijing is alternately dominated by Siberian High-pressure and Western Pacific Subtropical High-pressure system in winter. The transport stage is with predominant Subtropical High-pressure which brings temperature and humidity rise. High humidity facilitates formation of secondary aerosols. The cumulative stage ends along with boosted Siberian High-pressure. (2) The severe haze is characterized by temperature inversion, low wind speed and high humidity, especially nearby surface, and experienced PM2.5 explosive growth. The stability of PBL structure will be strengthened with decreased PBL height, which inhibits the dispersion of pollutants. (3) The PM2.5 concentrations during different stages had different regional distribution. The southern PM2.5 concentration is much high than northern in transport stage. During dispersion stage, urban central PM2.5 is the high for the reason that buildings, vehicle exhaust and urban heat island effects all impedehaze disappearing. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Aerosols; Boundary layers; Pollution; Tropics; Water resources; Wind; Concentration distributions; High pressure system; Meteorological factors; Planetary boundary layers; Regional distribution; Temperature and humidities; Temperature inversions; Urban Heat Island Effects; Atmospheric temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072890790

This study reviewed the relevant literature, then adopted the Taichung metropolitan area as the research target and assessed carbon emissions with respect to buildings, traffic, and carbon sinks. The overall carbon budget of the metropolitan area was mapped following a statistical analysis of the numerical data and urban space information. The results of this study indicated that the annual average urban carbon emissions consist of 67.6% building carbon emissions, 30.5% traffic carbon emissions, and −1.9% carbon sink absorption. In this study, a multiple regression model was used to calculate the floor area of each building. This study also determined that densely populated areas emitted higher levels of carbon than less populated areas. For every square meter of total floor area, 16.51 tCO2/m2·yr of carbon were emitted from buildings every year. Recommended policies for the city government to implement in the future were organized and used to establish three simulation scenarios of the various implementation stages. The results indicated that adjusting the floor area ratio of buildings is the optimal carbon reduction approach, achieving a reduction of at most 620,363 tons of carbon per year, and multi-scale carbon reduction hotspots were mapped out. In addition, the high-resolution grid was used to present the multi-scale carbon budget results, which helps government agencies to formulate follow-up priority carbon reduction strategies and urban carbon neutral policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building design; Carbon accounting; Carbon dioxide; Urban design; Urban policy","Architectural design; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Floors; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Regression analysis; Urban planning; Building design; Carbon accounting; Carbon dioxide emissions; High-resolution grids; Industrial revolutions; Multiple regression model; Urban design; Urban policy; Structural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066034373

The major challenge is to meet the demand-supply balance while maintaining a positive profit-loss ratio. Further, Government enforced climate change policies attract low carbon technology (LCT) distributed energy resources (DER), which further complicate matters. Along with DN, the domestic appliance industry has undergone drastic modernization leading to appliances with advanced control and power efficient technologies as well as automation capabilities. This paper proposes a demand response (DR) program that facilitates these advancements while micromanaging the domestic load consumption pattern so as to manage peak demand in the network. This work identifies consumer conviction towards the DR programs as the major bottle neck for the success of such load management programs. The mixed integer linear programming based DR (MILP - DR) algorithm proposed here, minimizes the consumer inconvenience while facilitating load reduction. Further, attractive consumer engagement plans promoting different levels of engagement (load reduction) are also proposed, which further enhance the choice offering for consumers. The algorithm is tested on a 74 load (domestic) urban distribution network having 8 different consumer profiles. The algorithm is capable of inducing impartiality between consumers by updating a tolerance factor correlating inconvenience of consumers with load deprivation. The results show the capability of the algorithm to distribute load reduction based on the engagement plan, while also minimizing the consumer inconvenience. The results also suggest correlations between social parameters and achievable DR. © 2019 IEEE.","Consumer behaviour; Consumer Comfort; Demand response; demand side management; Energy management; Integer linear programming","Bottles; Climate change; Consumer behavior; Demand side management; Electric utilities; Energy management; Energy resources; Integer programming; Climate change policies; Consumer Comfort; Demand response; Demand response programs; Distributed energy resource; Integer Linear Programming; Mixed integer linear programming; Urban distribution networks; Domestic appliances",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075760811

In this framework, guaranteeing cleaner energy is the key parameter for cleaner production, especially for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants to the environment, which are directly related to the types of the energy sources used. Through the methodology of LCA it can help in the study of the environmental part. This study is based on the methodologies ISO 14040 and 14044 for obtaining quantitative results on the environmental impact, from cradle to grave, of different waste collection systems. A sensitive study of the influence of the energy source on the life cycle assessment (LCA)is analysed for six different waste collection systems (trucks - electric, gas, diesel, diesel-electric, gas-electric - and stationary pneumatic waste collection)and five energy sources (Spanish energy mix 2008, hydropower, photovoltaic, wind, and a renewable energy mix). The results show that the energy source has a big impact in the results of the LCA with variations up to 80%. The environmental impact of each collection system depends strongly on the source of the energy used and thus, decision-makers should consider the energy source and the expected evolution of energy mix when considering the best waste collection systems from an environmental point of view. In a framework with a majority of fossil-sourced energy, the truck collection shows lesser environmental impact, due to its lower electricity use, whereas in a renewable energy environment, the stationary pneumatic waste collection shows better performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ecoindicator 99; Energy mix; Energy source; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Municipal waste collection; Sensitivity analysis","Decision making; Diesel engines; Greenhouse gases; Pneumatics; Pollution control; Sensitivity analysis; Solid wastes; Trucks; Waste management; Eco-Indicator 99; Energy mix; Energy source; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Municipal waste; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066316625

This allows a better representation of the spatial distribution of carbon and nitrogen stocks across LULC. The aim of this study was to emphasize the relevance of using in situ carbon and nitrogen content of the main tree species of the site when quantifying the aboveground carbon and nitrogen stocks in the context of carbon accounting. This paper contributes to that, by combining satellite images with in situ carbon and nitrogen content in dry matter of stem woods together with locally derived and published allometric models to estimate aboveground carbon and nitrogen stocks at the Dassari Basin in the Sudan Savannah zone in the Republic of Benin. Results: The estimated mean carbon content per tree species varied from 44.28 ± 0.21% to 49.43 ± 0.27%. The overall mean carbon content in dry matter for the 277 wood samples of the 18 main tree species of the region was 47.01 ± 0.28% - which is close to the Tier 1 coefficient of 47% default value suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The overall mean fraction of nitrogen in dry matter was estimated as 0.229 ± 0.016%. The estimated mean carbon density varied from 1.52 ± 0.14 Mg C ha-1 (for Cropland and Fallow) to 97.83 ± 27.55 Mg C ha-1 (for Eucalyptus grandis Plantation). In the same order the estimated mean nitrogen density varied from 0.008 ± 0.007 Mg ha-1 of N (for Cropland and Fallow) to 0.321 ± 0.088 Mg ha-1 of N (for Eucalyptus grandis Plantation). Conclusion: The results show the relevance of using the in situ carbon and nitrogen content of the main tree species for estimating aboveground carbon and nitrogen stocks in the Sudan Savannah environment. The results provide crucial information for carbon accounting programmes related to the implementation of the REDD + initiatives in developing countries. © 2019 The Author(s).","Aboveground; Africa; Assess; Carbon; In situ; Nitrogen; REDD + programmes; Relevance; Sudan Savannah","aboveground biomass; biogenic emission; carbon emission; deforestation; dry matter; environmental disturbance; in situ measurement; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; land cover; land use change; nitrogen; satellite imagery; Benin [West Africa]; Georgia; Savannah; Sudan; United States; Eucalyptus grandis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072191789

While hybrid powertrains offer many opportunities, they also present new developmental challenges. Due to the many variants and possible architectures, development issues, such as the definition of powertrain concepts and the optimization of operating strategies, are becoming more and more important. The paper presents model-based fuel economy analyses of different hybrid vehicle configurations, depending on the position of the electric motor generator (EMG). The analyses are intended to support the design of powertrain architecture and the components sizing, depending on the driving scenario, with the aim of reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The analyses are performed making use of a comprehensive vehicle model, based on a hybrid (black-box and lumped parameters) approach, of a medium passenger car equipped with a turbocharged Diesel engine. The model has been enhanced to account for the additional components of two different powertrain configurations: One with the EMG directly coupled to the crankshaft and the other with the EMG positioned downstream the gearbox. Simulations have been carried out vs. standard and real driving cycles for two energy management strategies, namely a rule-based strategy (RBS) and an equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS).

For countries with significant hydropower potential, the technology is expected to play a major role in the energy transition needed to meet nationally determined contributions (NDCs) for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions as laid out in the Paris Agreement. For the Republic of Ecuador, large hydropower is currently considered as the main means for attaining energy security, reducing electricity prices and mitigating GHG emissions in the long-term. However, uncertainty around the impacts of climate change, investment cost overruns and restrictions to untapped resources may challenge the future deployment of hydropower and consequently impact decarbonization efforts for Ecuador’s power sector. To address these questions, a partial equilibrium energy system optimization model for Ecuador (TIMES-EC) is used to simulate alternative electricity capacity expansion scenarios up to 2050. Results show that the share of total electricity supplied by hydropower in Ecuador might vary significantly between 53% to 81% by 2050. Restricting large hydropower due to social-environmental constraints can cause a fourfold increase in cumulative emissions compared to NDC implied levels, while a 25% reduction of hydropower availability due to climate change would cause cumulative emissions to double. In comparison, a more diversified power system (although more expensive) which limits the share of large hydropower and natural gas in favour of other renewables could achieve the expected NDC emission levels. These insights underscore the critical importance of undertaking detailed whole energy system analyses to assess the long-term challenges for hydropower deployment and the trade-offs among power system configuration, system costs and expected GHG emissions in hydropower-dependent countries, states and territories. Key policy insights Ecuador’s hydropower-based NDC is highly vulnerable to the occurrence of a dry climate scenario and restrictions to deployment of large hydropower in the Amazon region. Given Ecuador’s seasonal runoff pattern, fossil-fuel or renewable thermoelectric backup will always be required, whatever the amount of hydropower installed. Ecuador’s NDC target for the power sector is achievable without the deployment of large hydropower infrastructure, through a more diversified portfolio with non-hydro renewables. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Ecuador; energy modelling; Hydropower; NDC; renewable energy","alternative energy; carbon emission; electricity; emission control; energy policy; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power; modeling; Ecuador",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066080817

Therefore, this article attempts to study on the spatial-temporal evolution and influencing factor on land use-related CO2 emissions at region-county level to promote county economy from CO2 source to CO2 sink. 9 regions and 38 counties in Chongqing of China were thus selected as study objects. Based on land use data, land use-related CO2 emissions were estimated using direct and indirect CO2 emission models for the period 1997–2015. On this basis, the space-time patterns were revealed from two scales of region and county. And the main factors influencing CO2 emissions according to land use were revealed based on Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) and geographic detector analysis (GDA), respectively. The results show that: 1) at regional scale, CO2 emissions of different regions all greatly improve in which southeastern ecological protection and development area showed the largest increase. Increases in per capita CO2 emissions in two-wing (suburban) areas are higher than those in downtown and surrounding-downtown areas. 2) at regional scale, the influences of various decomposed factors on the change of CO2 emissions fluctuate. The effect of population shows an insignificant influence on CO2 emissions. Economic development greatly influences CO2 emissions. Additionally, energy consumption shows a significant inhibitory effect on CO2 emissions while energy mix exhibits significant hysteresis. 3) at county scale, heavy CO2 emissions are concentrated in core urban areas; moderate and mild emissions occur mainly in the main urban expansion area, the region around the main urban areas, and in regional hub cities; low emissions are mainly concentrated in the Wuling mountainous area in southeast Chongqing and the Three Gorges Reservoir area in northeast Chongqing. 4) at county scale, the main influences on land use-related CO2 emissions are total energy consumption, per capita GDP, and urbanization rate. Minor influences include population size, proportion of secondary and tertiary industries, and proportion of land used for construction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chongqing of China; Influencing factor; Land use-related CO2 emissions; Region-county characteristic; Spatial-temporal evolution","Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy utilization; Industrial economics; Land use; Population statistics; Chongqing; CO2 emissions; Influencing factor; Region-county characteristic; Spatial-temporal evolution; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066432747

Such feedbacks have the potential to significantly alter future climate change. These feedbacks may also exert significant changes on 21st-century energy, agriculture, land use and carbon cycle projections, but little is known about their possible magnitudes, or about regional and sector dynamics under different forcing scenarios. Here we use an integrated Earth System Model (ESM) featuring bidirectional information exchange between an economically-oriented integrated assessment model and the ESM to examine how human-natural feedbacks operate under high and medium radiative forcing (RF) scenarios. Specifically, we examine the effect of changing land productivity on human systems, and the effect of changing land use/land cover and CO2 emissions on the Earth system. We find that the effect of coupling differs across radiative forcing levels and across regions, due to differences in the climate signal, human responses to those signals, and regional characteristics. In particular, we find reductions in cropland area due to feedbacks in both the medium and high RF scenarios. In the medium RF scenario, these reductions result in increased area for bioenergy and afforestation and reduced energy system CO2 emissions, as the carbon price in this scenario incentivizes low carbon energy sources and terrestrial carbon storage; these incentives are absent in the high RF scenario. These differences are key to understanding the possible future evolution pathways of the integrated Earth system in response to 21st century climate change. Additional models and hypothesis testing are needed to determine exactly when and how bidirectional feedbacks between human and Earth systems should be considered in future assessments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"Agricultural robots; Atmospheric radiation; Carbon dioxide; Land use; Reforestation; Agricultural productions; Anthropogenic emissions; Information exchanges; Integrated assessment models; Land productivities; Land use/land cover; Regional characteristics; Renewable energy potentials; Climate change; afforestation; agricultural production; anthropogenic source; carbon emission; climate modeling; land use change; nature-society relations; radiative forcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067873161

However, support for this claim is lacking across broad taxonomic groups. A framework for defining ecosystem processes in terms of the functional traits of their constituent taxa across large spatial scales is needed. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the linkages between climate, plant traits and soil microbial traits at many sites spanning a broad latitudinal temperature gradient from tropical to subalpine forests. Our results show that temperature drives coordinated shifts in most plant and soil bacterial traits but these relationships are not observed for most fungal traits. Shifts in plant traits are mechanistically associated with soil bacterial functional traits related to carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling, indicating that microbial processes are tightly linked to variation in plant traits that influence rates of ecosystem decomposition and nutrient cycling. Our results are consistent with hypotheses that diversity gradients reflect shifts in phenotypic optima signifying local temperature adaptation mediated by soil nutrient availability and metabolism. They underscore the importance of temperature in structuring the functional diversity of plants and soil microbes in forest ecosystems and how this is coupled to biogeochemical processes via functional traits. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"nitrogen; biodiversity; ecosystem; forest; soil; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Forests; Nitrogen; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071123632

With more focus on real world emissions from light-duty vehicles, the interactions between engine and exhaust gas aftertreatment are critical. For modern engines, most emissions are generated during the warm-up phase following a cold start. For Diesel engines this is exaggerated due to colder exhaust temperatures and larger aftertreatment systems. The De-NOx aftertreatment can be particularly problematic. Engine manufacturers are required to take measures to address these temperature issues which often result in higher fuel consumption (retarding combustion, increasing engine load or reducing the Diesel air-fuel ratio). In this paper we consider an inner-insulated turbocharger as an alternative, passive technology which aims to reduce the exhaust heat losses between the engine and the aftertreatment. Firstly, the concept and design of the inner-insulated turbocharger is presented. A transient 3D CFD/FEM (Computation Fluid Dynamics/Finite Element Modelling) simulation is conducted and predicts that external heat losses will be reduced by 70% compared to a standard turbocharger, i.e. non-insulated turbocharger. A 1D modelling methodology is then presented for capturing the behaviour of the inner-insulated turbocharger. This is important as conventional models based on isentropic efficiency maps cannot accurately predict turbine outlet temperature. The alternative model is essential to demonstrate benefits in system-level simulations. Experimental results are presented from a transient air-path testing facility to validate the 1D model and demonstrate the characteristics of the inner-insulated turbocharger. Finally, the validated 1D model is used within a powertrain optimization simulation to demonstrate an improvement in fuel consumption for iso-NOx emissions over a low load city cycle of up to 3%. The work was conducted under the THOMSON project which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Program for research, technological development and demonstration under Agreement no. 724037.

In order to support the uptake of renewables in the DH sector, the European Commission proposed to open DH infrastructures to third parties. This will allow independent heat producers to supply heat produced from renewable energy sources and from waste heat to consumers connected to the grid. This paper develops a better understanding of the complexity associated with the introduction of third party grid access (TPA). We will analyse the heterogeneous institutional set-up of DH markets in the EU and discuss competition and market boundaries in the heat market. Based on this, the paper investigates the technical, regulatory and economic challenges that arise from the practical implementation of TPA. We conclude that TPA alone will not be sufficient to support the expansion of renewables in the DH sector. Complementary policy measures will be necessary to transform the DH sector towards 4th generation DH systems that will become an integrated element of a smart energy system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","District heating; Regulation; Renewable heating; Third party access","Commerce; Renewable energy resources; Waste heat; District heating system; Economic challenges; European Commission; Regulation; Renewable energy source; Renewable heating; Smart energy systems; Third party access; District heating; alternative energy; energy market; energy use; heating; integrated approach; regulatory framework; smart grid; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067854797

Using the localized effects of climate change, we examine whether notable changes in temperature can raise the salience of the issue, thus encouraging a legislative response. To evaluate the behavior of individual legislators around climate policy, we utilize an original data set that includes geographic mapping of climate anomalies at the state legislative district level and incorporates individual, chamber, district, and state characteristics to predict climate bill sponsorship. Using a multilevel model that estimates climate change bill sponsorship among 25,000 legislators from 2011 to 2015, we find a robust relationship between temperature anomalies and bill sponsorship for Democratic members of state legislators while Republicans are unresponsive to such factors. Our data and methodological approach allow us to examine legislative action on climate change beyond final policy passage and offers an opportunity to understand the motivations behind climate innovation in the American states. © The Author(s) 2019.","agenda setting; climate change; geographic information systems; policy process; policy responsiveness; public policy; representation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065176913

OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to estimate the association between acute exposures to ambient PM2:5 and psychiatric emergency department (ED) utilization and to determine if it is modified by community deprivation. METHODS: We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to analyze all pediatric, psychiatric ED encounters at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, from 2011 to 2015 (n = 13,176). Conditional logistic regression models adjusted for temperature, humidity, and holiday effects were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for a psychiatric ED visit 0–3 d after ambient PM2:5 exposures, estimated at residential addresses using a spatiotemporal model. RESULTS: A 10-lg=m3 increase in PM2:5 was associated with a significant increase in any psychiatric ED utilization 1 [OR = 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.12)] and 2 [OR = 1.05 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.10)] d later.

Unlocking genetic data from the typically highly degraded DNA obtained from herbarium specimens was difficult until the arrival of high-throughput sequencing approaches, which can be applied to low quantities of severely fragmented DNA. Target enrichment involves using short molecular probes that hybridise and capture genomic regions of interest for high-throughput sequencing. In this study on herbariomics, we used this targeted sequencing approach and the Angiosperms353 universal probe set to recover up to 351 nuclear genes from 435 herbarium specimens that are up to 204 years old and span the breadth of angiosperm diversity. We show that on average 207 genes were successfully retrieved from herbarium specimens, although the mean number of genes retrieved and target enrichment efficiency is significantly higher for silica gel-dried specimens. Forty-seven target nuclear genes were recovered from a herbarium specimen of the critically endangered St Helena boxwood, Mellissia begoniifolia, collected in 1815. Herbarium specimens yield significantly less high-molecular-weight DNA than silica gel-dried specimens, and genomic DNA quality declines with sample age, which is negatively correlated with target enrichment efficiency. Climate, taxon-specific traits, and collection strategies additionally impact target sequence recovery. We also detected taxonomic bias in targeted sequencing outcomes for the 10 most numerous angiosperm families that were investigated in depth. We recommend that (1) for species distributed in wet tropical climates, silica gel-dried specimens should be used preferentially; (2) for species distributed in seasonally dry tropical climates, herbarium and silica gel-dried specimens yield similar results, and either collection can be used; (3) taxon-specific traits should be explored and established for effective optimisation of taxon-specific studies using herbarium specimens; (4) all herbarium sheets should, in future, be annotated with details of the preservation method used; (5) long-term storage of herbarium specimens should be in stable, low-humidity, and low-temperature environments; and (6) targeted sequencing with universal probes, such as Angiosperms353, should be investigated closely as a new approach for DNA barcoding that will ensure better exploitation of herbarium specimens than traditional Sanger sequencing approaches. © Copyright © 2019 Brewer, Clarkson, Maurin, Zuntini, Barber, Bellot, Biggs, Cowan, Davies, Dodsworth, Edwards, Eiserhardt, Epitawalage, Frisby, Grall, Kersey, Pokorny, Leitch, Forest and Baker.","angiosperms; degraded DNA; DNA barcoding; genomics; herbariomics; herbarium specimens; high-throughput sequencing; target enrichment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072891175

Failure to account for the variability of the indoor infiltration of ambient PM2.5 and O3, and time indoors, can induce exposure errors. We developed an exposure model called TracMyAir, which is an iPhone application (“app”) that determines seven tiers of individual-level exposure metrics in real-time for ambient PM2.5 and O3 using outdoor concentrations, weather, home building characteristics, time-locations, and time-activities. We linked a mechanistic air exchange rate (AER) model, a mass-balance PM2.5 and O3 building infiltration model, and an inhaled ventilation model to determine outdoor concentrations (Tier 1), residential AER (Tier 2), infiltration factors (Tier 3), indoor concentrations (Tier 4), personal exposure factors (Tier 5), personal exposures (Tier 6), and inhaled doses (Tier 7). Using the application in central North Carolina, we demonstrated its ability to automatically obtain real-time input data from the nearest air monitors and weather stations, and predict the exposure metrics. A sensitivity analysis showed that the modeled exposure metrics can vary substantially with changes in seasonal indoor-outdoor temperature differences, daily home operating conditions (i.e., opening windows and operating air cleaners), and time spent outdoors. The capability of TracMyAir could help reduce uncertainty of ambient PM2.5 and O3 exposure metrics used in epidemiology studies. © 2019 by the authors.

Determining the carbon metric (CM), as part of the whole carbon footprint of a building, contributes to quantify the carbon emissions related to the building's use stage. Although many carbon footprint calculators exist in other sectors, none has been specifically designed and applicable to the building one. However, ISO 16745 provides guidelines for calculating and reporting the CM of existing buildings in operation. In this context, this work sets a methodology to measure the CM of existing households' use stage, based on ISO 16745 and split into three stages. The implementation of the methodology to a case study proved its applicability since it enabled the data collection task through the designed survey, and allowed the energy carriers and end-uses be disaggregated, quantified and clearly reported for user's knowledge. The study outlined that calculating the CM and, more specifically, reporting and making the results publicly available, help raise users' awareness about reducing greenhouse gas-related emissions, and provide new ideas for monitoring, benchmarking and proposing policies at individual member state and EU levels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon metric; Household sector; Household survey; ISO 16745; Use stage","Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Surveys; Carbon emissions; Data collection; Energy carriers; Household sectors; Household surveys; ISO 16745; Residential sectors; Upward trend; Carbon footprint; carbon footprint; energy policy; European Union; guideline; household survey; residential energy; state role; survey design; trend analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066947366

We hypothesized that photosynthetic carbon fixation by cyanobacteria does not support the plankton metabolism inside the Ría. Net community production (NCP) was calculated from differences between gross community production (GCP) and dark community respiration rates measured by in situ incubations using the oxygen light-and-dark technique. Our results reveal the carbon budget inside the Ría is not balanced by autotrophic production. The deficit of net ecosystem production throughout the year ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 mg m–2 d–1 below what is necessary to sustain local plankton metabolism. We argue that the offset between daily GCP and total community respiration may be balanced by grazing of nano-heterotrophs on heterotrophic bacteria.

Following previous studies, this study mainly aimed to quantify determinants of selected IAP, in nursery and primary schools from both urban and rural sites, accounting for seasonal variations. In 101 indoor microenvironments (classrooms, bedrooms and canteens) from 25 nursery and primary schools, CO2, CO, HCOH, NO2, O3, total volatile organic compounds, PM1, PM2.5, PM10, total suspended particles (TSP), and meteorological/comfort parameters were continuously sampled (occupancy and background levels), from at least 24 h to 9 consecutive days (not simultaneously) in each studied room; in some cases weekend was also considered. Children faced thermal discomfort and inadequate humidity, respectively in 60.1% and 44.1% of the studied classrooms. They were also exposed to high levels of IAP, namely PM2.5 and CO2 respectively in 69.0% and 41.3% of the studied classrooms, mostly in urban sites, depending on season and on occupancy and activity patterns (different amongst age groups). As PM2.5 and CO2 were the major concerning IAP, multivariate linear regression models were built to quantify (explained variability and relative importance) their main determinants, in both occupancy and non-occupancy (background) periods. Models for occupancy periods showed higher explained variability (R2 = 0.64, 0.57 and 0.47, respectively, for CO2, PM2.5 and PM10) than for non-occupancy. Besides background concentrations (43.5% of relative importance), relative humidity (21.1%), flooring material (17.0%), heating (6.7%) and age group of the occupants (5.3%), adjusted for season of sampling (6.4%) were predictors in CO2 occupancy model. In the cases of PM2.5 and PM10 occupancy concentrations, besides background concentrations (71.2% and 67.2% of relative importance, respectively for PM2.5 and PM10), type of school management (8.8% and 15.2%) and flooring material (13.9% and 13.9%), adjusted for season of sampling (6.1% and 3.8%), were the main predictors. These findings support the need of mitigation measures to reduce IAP levels, and prevention actions to avoid children's exposure. Reducing the time spent indoors in the same microenvironment by doing more and/or longer breaks, improving ventilation and cleaning actions, and avoiding or making a better maintenance hardwood flooring materials, chalkboard use and VOC emitting materials, are practices that should be implemented and their impacts quantified. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Children; Exposure; Indoor air quality; Nursery and primary school","carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; child health; indoor air; pollution exposure; primary education; relative humidity; rural area; urban area; ventilation; volatile organic compound; age; air pollutant; air quality; Article; cleaning; environmental exposure; humidity; indoor air pollution; meteorology; microenvironment; nursery school; particulate matter; primary school; priority journal; rural area; seasonal variation; urban area; air conditioning; air pollutant; child; environmental monitoring; human; indoor air pollution; school; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Schools; Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067287267

At the same time, regional weather modification methods, like cloud seeding, are being used to counteract increasing water scarcity in arid regions. Large-scale sustainable desert agroforestry plantations can contribute to climate change mitigation and can also be used to modify regional climate, particularly rainfall. Climate impacts from plantations need to be well understood before considering implementation. Typically, impact studies are attempted at continental or global scales and use coarse-resolution models, which suffer from severe systematic errors. This is highly problematic because decision makers should only countenance geoengineering schemes like global afforestation if impacts are understood on the regional scale. We posit the necessity of using high-resolution regional models with sophisticated representations of land–atmosphere feedback and vegetation. This approach allows for studying desert plantations and the process chain leading to climate modification. We demonstrate that large-scale plantations enhance regional clouds and rainfall and derive an index for predicting plantation impacts. Thus, desert plantations represent a unique environmental solution via predictable regional weather modification and carbon storage. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

We evaluated whether the effects of climate factors on species distribution/occurrence are consistently modelled over different spatial scales in birds, and used a two-scale approach to identify species–climate correlations unlikely to represent causal effects. We used passerine birds inhabiting mountain grassland in the Apennines (Italy) as a model. We surveyed four grassland species at 400 sampling points, and built habitat selection models (territory scale) and distribution models (seven algorithms, landscape scale). We compared the effect of climatic predictors on occurrence/distribution highlighted by models over the two spatial scales, and with the effects supposed a priori based on the climatic niche of each species. Models at the territory level included at least one climatic predictor for three species; the observed effect of climatic predictors was seldom consistent with supposed effects. At the broadest scale, distribution models for all species included climatic predictors, with varying consistence with supposed effects and findings at the finer scale. Despite the importance of climate for species distribution, occurrence could be more directly related to other factors, with important implications for understanding/predicting the impacts of climate/environmental changes. Our approach revealed key variables for grassland birds, and highlighted the scale-dependent perceived importance of climate. At the local scale, climate effects were weak or hard to interpret. We found a general lack of consistence between supposed and observed effects at the territory level, and between landscape and territory models. Our results show the importance of predicting the potential effect of climatic factors prior to the analyses, carefully selecting ecologically meaningful variables and scales, and evaluating the nature and scale of climate–species links. We call for caution when predicting under future climates, especially when mechanistic effects and consistency across scales are lacking. © 2019 Nordic Society Oikos","climate change; distribution; habitat selection; Passeriformes; SDM; territory scale",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073229731

Heavy-tailed distributions have the property that studying the effects of the few large values already yields most of the overall effect of the whole quantity. For example, if reducing the CO2 emissions of the buildings of a country is the issue, then in case of a heavy-tailed distribution, only the effects of the relatively few large cities need to be considered. It is shown that the number of buildings in German municipalities or counties or the number of building-related event histories of a certain vanished building stock follow a heavy-tailed distribution and give evidence for the type of underlying distribution. The methodology used is a recent statistical framework for discerning power law and other heavy-tailed distributions in empirical data. © The Author(s) 2018.","building stock; event histories; Heavy-tailed distribution; log-normal distribution; Zipf’s law","building; comparative study; power law distribution; probability; quantitative analysis; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053372222

This paper establishes a simple core–periphery model with monocentric cities, which comprises key forces that shape the structure and interrelation of cities to study the impact of the urban evolution on the environment. We focus on global warming and the potential of unfettered market forces to economize on emissions. The model parameters are chosen to match the dichotomy between average “large” and “small” cities in the urban geography of the United States, and the sectoral greenhouse gas emissions recorded for the United States. Based on numerical analyzes we find that a forced switch to a system with equally sized cities reduces total emissions. Second, any city driver which pronounces the asymmetry between the core and the periphery drives up emissions in the total city system, too, and the endogenous adjustment of the urban system accounts for the bulk of the change in emissions. Third, none of the city drivers gives rise to an urban environmental Kuznets curve according to our numerical simulations. Finally, the welfare-maximizing allocation tends to involve dispersion of cities and the more so the higher is the marginal damage from pollution. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","city structure; city systems; commuting costs; environmental Kuznets curve; environmental pollution; global warming; housing; trade costs","commuting; cost analysis; environmental factor; global warming; Kuznets curve; urban development; urban economy; urban housing; urbanization; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060134359

Its location makes it prone to mixed pollution contributions, combining the influence of residential, industrial, agricultural, maritime road and traffic sources. For this study, the origins of carbonaceous particles sampled over several months are investigated by a coupled approach based on analyses of radiocarbon (14C), elemental to total carbon ratio (EC/TC)and various molecular tracers (levoglucosan, methoxyphenols, malic and glyceric acids), giving information about their background origins. Accelerator mass spectrometry with a gas ion source give the opportunity to quantify the fossil and non-fossil fractions for each individual sample, avoiding to pool them. Analyzing 14C in micro-samples (down to a few μg of carbon)complements the approach based on chemical tracers, which are useful to identify sources, but insufficient to quantify accurately the modern and fossil carbon fractions. The measurements in about 30 samples collected during summer and fall/winter 2013, allow the detection of a strong seasonality of the pollution: the fall/winter PM2.5 fraction concentration equals to three times the summer concentration and we observe a significant fluctuation of the relative contributions of fossil and non-fossil fractions (fNF is ≈ 0.83 for fall/winter samples and ≈0.59 for summer samples). Significant correlations between 14C, levoglucosan and different methoxyphenols, allow the identification and quantification of a major influence of biomass burning emissions during fall and winter. Biomass burning organic carbon (OCBB)and elemental carbon (ECBB)contribute to 45% and 8% of the TC, respectively, whereas their total contribution is only 3% in summer samples. Biogenic emissions from the vegetation are the main sources of carbon during summer (≈57%). Significant correlations between summer OCbio and malic acid and DL glyceric acid suggest a secondary origin for this fraction. The total fossil carbon concentration (ECF and OCF)from vehicular, shipping and industrial sources is constant throughout the year, which is compatible with intense road and maritime traffics and industrial activity during both seasons. Overall, our study based on 14C and molecular tracers illustrates the power of a coupled approach in order to both identify and quantify biomass burning, biogenic, traffic and industrial sources of carbonaceous aerosols, forming a complex mix of background PM origins in a typical industrious harbor of the Mediterranean region. © 2019","Carbonaceous particles; Levoglucosan; Mediterranean basin; PM2.5; Radiocarbon","Aerosols; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biomass; Chemical analysis; Ion sources; Mass spectrometry; Pollution; Roads and streets; Tracers; Carbonaceous particles; Levoglucosan; Mediterranean basin; PM2.5; Radiocarbon; Organic carbon; carbon 14; glyceric acid; guaiacol; levoglucosan; malic acid; organic carbon; aerosol; biomass burning; chemical compound; pollutant source; radiocarbon dating; source apportionment; traffic emission; aerosol; Article; autumn; biomass; carbon source; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); fossil; mass spectrometry; particulate matter; pollution; priority journal; seasonal variation; summer; traffic; winter; Bouches du Rhone; Fos sur Mer; France; Marseilles; Mediterranean Sea; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066286780

Among air contaminants, black carbon (BC) has been identified as a sensitive marker of traffic related air pollution. This study aims to investigate the spatial distribution of BC in the catchment area of an elementary school of Milan, the biggest city in Northern Italy, using Land Use Regression (LUR) models and focusing especially on Morning Rush Hour (MRH). Methods: Two recruitment campaigns were performed asking schoolchildren's parents and residents of the study area to host a monitoring site in their own dwellings. Finally, 34 monitoring sites and 1 reference site were sampled. BC was measured in two seasonal campaigns using eight micro-aethalometers. Six seasonal and annual LUR models were developed, 3 focused on MRH. Results: Overall, median BC was 3247 and 1309 ng/m3 in the cold and warm season, respectively. In both seasons, there was a significant spatial variation between the monitoring sites. MRH values were higher than the daily values with median concentrations of 4227 and 2331 ng/m3, respectively. Developed LUR models showed that BC variability is well explained only by traffic variables; R2 ranged from 0.52 to 0.79 and from 0.65 to 0.81, for seasonal/annual and MRH LUR models respectively. Discussion.: LUR models based on traffic variables explain most of the measured BC distribution variability for both warm and cold season. MRH represents a critical moment for BC during all the year, with an increase of 1000 ng/m3 respective to the daily median value and differences in magnitude according to location. Our results highlight that the mobility issue is one of the most important challenges to reduce air pollution in the city of Milan and this is of particular concern for elementary schoolchildren that commute to school during MRH. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Black carbon (BC); Environmental monitoring; Land use regression (LUR); Schoolchildren; Traffic pollution","black carbon; carbon; annual variation; atmospheric pollution; building; catchment; environmental monitoring; model; regression analysis; seasonal variation; spatial distribution; spatial variation; traffic emission; air pollution; Article; catchment; child; cold; human; Italy; primary school; priority journal; school child; season; warming; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; Europe; particulate matter; season; Italy; Lombardy; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Italy; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066930513

The two cases considered below are energy pipelines in Durban, South Africa. On the one hand, urgency is associated with greenhouse-gas emissions mitigation, to slow climate change that is already doing enormous damage in this city. Yet on the other hand, the lengthy payback of mega-project investments made in long-term fossil fuel projects (and hence their reliance upon public subsidisation and guarantees) and the financial difficulty of switching to low-carbon transport, energy and waste disposal systems, together mean that temporal contradictions loom large. In sum, it appears impossible to align socio-ecological survival needs with investors’ profit-driven time horizons. This is the case involving a controversial pipeline for petroleum products from the African continent’s largest refinery complex (South Durban) to its largest market (Johannesburg), constructed at the same time as was piping to redirect methane that is emitted from the continent’s largest landfill, into a new electricity generator (in central Durban). The context, globally and locally, is that the ‘displacements’ of overaccumulated capital into infrastructure finance (and then specifically into piping systems) hit both temporal and spatial barriers, failing to deliver the promised returns on the infrastructure investments. With such insights, critical urban activists can better apply contrary analysis—of time, space, scale, class, race and environmental overlaps—whenever local growth coalitions parrot the slogan used to justify massive public subsidization of this infrastructure on behalf of investors: ‘build it, and they will come.’ The next question: who wins and loses—and when?. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","energy; infrastructure; methane; oil; piping; solid waste",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075441583

The methodology adopted involved: identifying local development organizations, focus group, interviews, and survey among families in the most vulnerable areas. The main findings show that Tapera residents do not associate the possible increase in their vulnerability to climate dynamics. They point to areas such as education, sanitation, and social assistance, as their most important local problems; thus not including climate change. To generate genuine participation it is crucial to creating initiatives that promote a social learning space for residents to evaluate their self-state of vulnerability and possibilities of development. Therefore climate change can make sense and the responses at the community level will be created in the context that shape how climate risk is perceived, prioritized and managed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climatic change; Land-use management; Perceptions; social learning; Southern Brazilian adaptation; Tapera da Base",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068393465

District heating and cooling systems are a viable solution to provide heat and cold in urban environments. Renewable heat and cold sources that may get incorporated in future urban energy systems will not provide the same high temperature output as current fossil fuel fired systems. Fifth generation district heating and cooling (5GDHC) systems are decentralized, bi-directional, close to ground temperature networks that use direct exchange of warm and cold return flows and thermal storage to balance thermal demand as much as possible. 5GDHC offers a way to incorporate low temperature renewable heat sources including shallow geothermal energy, as well as reduce total demand by recuperating generated heat from cooling and generated cold from heating. The large scale of 5GDHC allows for optimal design of technical parts like heat pumps and thermal storage vessels, while increasing overall system efficiency by incorporating a large variety of supply and demand profiles.

Prior research has assessed willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental and ethical attributes on foods and beverages such as locally grown, fairly traded, and organically produced. However, few studies have examined WTP for agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, especially in the U.S. and to date, no prior study has examined how knowledge or concerns about climate change motivate WTP for climate-friendly products. The objective of this study was to estimate WTP for agricultural GHG mitigation and examine variability in WTP across consumer characteristics, climate change knowledge and risk perception. A sensory-grounded choice experiment and survey assessing climate change knowledge and risk perception was administrated to specialty food and beverage shoppers in the Midwest and Northeastern U.S. Male and lower-income participants, as well as those at the Midwestern study site were willing to pay a higher premium for agricultural GHG mitigation, relative to females, higher income participants, and those in the Northeastern U.S. Knowledge of climate change and level of concerns for the risks it poses were not significantly associated with increased WTP for agricultural GHG mitigation. This suggests that if consumer demand is going to play a role in driving agricultural GHG mitigation, motivations for such purchasing behavior must be more fully understood. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon footprint; Choice experiment; Climate change; Climate change knowledge and risk perception; Greenhouse gas emission labels; Latent class analysis; Willingness to pay","agricultural production; carbon footprint; discrete choice analysis; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; organic farming; public attitude; risk assessment; social impact assessment; soil emission; willingness to pay; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072636608

Experimental evidence for such a dramatic phase change in the structure of the nucleus has not yet been observed. Purpose: To understand the role of α condensation in light nuclei experimentally. Method: To examine signatures of this α condensation, a compound nucleus reaction using 160-, 280-, and 400-MeV O16 beams impinging on a carbon target was used to investigate the C12(O16,7α) reaction. This permits a search for near-threshold states in the α-conjugate nuclei up to Mg24. Results: Events up to an α-particle multiplicity of seven were measured and the results were compared to both an extended Hauser-Feshbach calculation and the Fermi breakup model. The measured multiplicity distribution exceeded that predicted from a sequential decay mechanism and had a better agreement with the multiparticle Fermi breakup model. Examination of how these 7α final states could be reconstructed to form Be8 and C12(02+) showed a quantitative difference in which decay modes were dominant compared to the Fermi breakup model. No new states were observed in O16, Ne20, and Mg24 due to the effect of the N-α penetrability suppressing the total α-particle dissociation decay mode. Conclusion: The reaction mechanism for a high-energy compound nucleus reaction can only be described by a hybrid of sequential decay and multiparticle breakup. Highly α-clustered states were seen which did not originate from simple binary reaction processes. Direct investigations of near-threshold states in N-α systems are inherently impeded by the Coulomb barrier prohibiting the observation of states in the N-α decay channel. No evidence of a highly clustered 15.1-MeV state in O16 was observed from [Si-28,C12(02+)]O16(06+) when reconstructing the Hoyle state from three α particles. Therefore, no experimental signatures for α condensation were observed. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072988391

We experimentally reduced rainfall and increased temperature across two contrasting study sites (deep sand dune vs shallow sand swale) to test how projected future climate conditions may impact soil fungal composition, richness and diversity. We also assessed fungal OTU warming responses and putative functions of 100 most abundant OTUs and 120 OTUs that either increased or decreased based on their presence/absence across treatments. We found a significant effect of study site, treatment and canopy species on fungal composition. Soil fungal diversity increased under warming treatment in swale plots as compared to control plots indicating a positive effect of warming on fungal diversity. In dunes, significantly more OTUs responded to drought than warming treatment. Among the most abundant soil fungal putative functional groups were endophytes, ericoid mycorrhizas, yeasts and ectomycorrhizas consistent with previous studies. Plant pathogens were found to increase across dunes and swales, while ericoid mycorrhizae decreased. In summary, our study revealed that it is critical to understand belowground microbial patterns as a result of climate change treatments for our ability to better predict how ecosystems may respond to global environmental changes in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity hotspot; Endophytes; Shrubs; Soil; Western Australia","Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Forestry; Fungi; Soils; Endophytes; Ericoid mycorrhizas; Global environmental change; Hot spot; Increased temperature; Mediterranean-type ecosystems; Shrubs; Western Australia; Climate change; biodiversity; climate conditions; community composition; endophyte; experimental study; fungus; Mediterranean environment; shrub; shrubland; species diversity; species richness; warming; article; biodiversity; canopy; climate change; controlled study; drought; ectomycorrhiza; endophyte; environmental change; nonhuman; plant disease; scrub; shrub; soil; warming; Western Australia; yeast; climate change; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; fungus; greenhouse effect; microbiology; physiology; soil; Southern Europe; Australia; Western Australia; Otus; Climate Change; Droughts; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Fungi; Global Warming; Mediterranean Region; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066068414

For two consecutive winters (2013–2014 and 2014–2015), suppressed wind stress and warm near-surface ocean temperature anomalies restricted vertical mixing between the surface and underlying nutrient-enriched waters. Here we assess historical data of sea surface temperature and sea level pressure, along with nearly a decade of biogeochemical float data to evaluate the impact of these warm events on organic carbon production. The first stratified winter experienced little apparent impact on the magnitude of net organic carbon production in the growing season relative to prior years, suggesting an immediate resilience from reduced new nutrients, apparently depending on recycled iron. However, the subsequent winter experienced virtually zero net production; a loss of resilience, perhaps due to net iron removal with export, was evident. We find that consistently enhanced winter stratification decreased carbon production much more so than a single warm winter. This study highlights the sensitivity of marine productivity to ocean atmosphere oscillations, reducing deep ocean carbon sequestration with prolonged ocean warming and stratification. © 2019.

Integrated control of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone in GD calls for a systematic review of historical emissions. In this study, emission trends, spatial variations, source-contribution variations, and reduction potentials of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO), PM2.5, inhalable particles (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in GD from 2006 to 2015 were first examined using a dynamic methodology, taking into account economic development, technology penetration, and emission controls. The relative change rates of anthropogenic emissions in GD during 2006-2015 are -48% for SO2, -0.5% for NO, -16% for PM2.5, -22% for PM10, 13% for CO, 3% for NH3, and 13% for VOCs. The declines of SO2, NO, PM2.5, and PM10 emissions in the whole province mainly resulted from the stringent emission control in the Pearl River delta (PRD) region, where most previous control measures were focused, especially on power plants (SO2 and NO), industrial combustion (SO2, PM2.5, PM10), on-road mobile sources (NO), and dust sources (PM2.5 and PM10). Emissions from other areas (non-PRD, NPRD), nevertheless, remain relatively stable due to the lax control measures and rapidly growing energy consumption. In addition, emission leaks of SO2 and NO from industries are observed from PRD to NPRD in 2010 and 2011. As a result, emissions in NPRD are increasingly important in GD, particularly those from industrial combustion. The contribution of NPRD to the total SO2 emissions in GD, for example, increased from 27% in 2006 to 48% in 2015. On-road mobile sources and solvent use are the two key sources that should receive more effective control measures in GD. Current control-driven emission reductions from on-road mobile sources are neutralized by the substantial growth of the vehicle population, while VOC emissions in GD steadily increase due to the growth of solvent use and the absence of effective control measures. Besides, future work could focus on power plants and industrial combustion in GD and industrial process sources in NPRD, which still have large emission reduction potentials. The historical emission inventory developed in this study not only helps to understand the emission evolution in GD, but also provides robust data to quantify the impact of emission and meteorology variations on air quality and unveil the primary cause of significant air-quality change in GD in the recent decade. © Author(s) 2019.",,"air quality; ammonia; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; emission inventory; haze; nitrogen oxides; ozone; point source pollution; spatial variation; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072538639

However, there are no consistent conclusions about the nexus between tourism and carbon emissions. Considering the possible nonlinear and spatial effects of tourism on carbon emissions, this paper employed spatial econometric models combined with quadratic terms of explanatory variables to explore the nexus between them using Chinese provincial panel data from 2003 to 2016. The main results are as follows: (1) There is a significant inverse U-shaped relationship between tourism development and carbon emissions. In the provinces whose tourism receipts are relatively low, the effects of tourism on carbon emissions are positive but decrease gradually as the tourism receipts increase and then shifts to negative and continues decreasing gradually when the tourism receipts beyond the critical value. (2) For the geographical proximity and industrial relevance, one province’s tourism development not only affects its carbon emissions but also affects its neighbors’ carbon emissions through spatial lag effect (indirect effect) which is also inverse U-shaped. (3) Carbon reduction policies, sustainable education, and transportation infrastructure all have significant moderating effects on the relationship between tourism and carbon emissions, but the moderating effect of the management efficiency of tourism is not statistically significant. Furthermore, improvements to the sustainable education and transportation infrastructure not only strengthen the direct negative effect of tourism on carbon emissions but also strengthen the indirect negative effect of tourism on carbon emissions.

Among the several bias correction techniques, univariate linear bias correction (e.g., quantile mapping) is the most popular, given its simplicity. Univariate linear bias correction can accurately reproduce the observed mean of a given climate variable. However, when performed separately on multiple variables, it does not yield the observed multivariate cross-correlation structure. In the current study, we consider the intrinsic properties of two candidate univariate linear bias-correction approaches (simple linear regression and asynchronous regression) in estimating the observed cross-correlation between precipitation and temperature. Two linear regression models are applied separately on both the observed and the projected variables. The analytical solution suggests that two candidate approaches simply reproduce the cross-correlation from the general circulation models (GCMs) in the bias-corrected data set because of their linearity. Our study adopts two frameworks, based on the Fisher z-transformation and bootstrapping, to provide 95% lower and upper confidence limits (referred as the permissible bound) for the GCM cross-correlation. Beyond the permissible bound, raw/bias-corrected GCM cross-correlation significantly differs from those observed. Two frameworks are applied on three GCMs from the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble over the coterminous United States. We found that (a) the univariate linear techniques fail to reproduce the observed cross-correlation in the bias-corrected data set over 90% (30–50%) of the grid points where the multivariate skewness coefficient values are substantial (small) and statistically significant (statistically insignificant) from zero; (b) the performance of the univariate linear techniques under bootstrapping (Fisher z-transformation) remains uniform (non-uniform) across climate regions, months, and GCMs; (c) grid points, where the observed cross-correlation is statistically significant, witness a failure fraction of around 0.2 (0.8) under the Fisher z-transformation (bootstrapping). The importance of reproducing cross-correlations is also discussed along with an enquiry into the multivariate approaches that can potentially address the bias in yielding cross-correlations. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","bias correction; bootstrapping; cross-correlation; Fisher z-transformation; precipitation; temperature; univariate","Climate models; Mathematical transformations; Metadata; Precipitation (chemical); Regression analysis; Temperature; Bias correction; bootstrapping; Cross correlations; Univariate; Z-transformation; Linear transformations; bootstrapping; climate modeling; climate prediction; correlation; multivariate analysis; precipitation (climatology); temperature profile; weather forecasting; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064527645

Their membrane consists of isoprenoid glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) which are applied in the widely used TEX86 proxy to reconstruct past sea surface temperatures (SSTs). However, in some specific marine systems, such as the Mediterranean Sea, core-top TEX86-derived temperatures do not seem to reflect annual mean SSTs. This has been attributed to contributions of deep-water dwelling Thaumarchaeota. Here, we investigate the potential causes of this bias by studying both the archaeal diversity as well as the intact polar lipid (IPL) GDGT composition in the Mediterranean water column by a combined 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and a lipidomic approach on suspended particulate matter (SPM) at different water depths. The archaeal distribution showed a dominance of archaea other than Thaumarchaeota, i.e. Marine Euryarchaeota group II and III in the upper epipelagic waters (0–100 m deep), while Thaumarchaeota (Marine group I; MGI) dominated the subsurface and the deeper waters. This shift in the archaeal community composition coincided with a decrease in IPL GDGT-0 and increase of IPL crenarchaeol. The ratio of GDGT-2/GDGT-3 increased with water depth, but values were lower than observed in deep marine waters of some other regions. The increase of the GDGT-2/GDGT-3 ratio coincided with the high relative abundance of deep-water MGI, which may be linked to the high temperature and salinity found in specific water masses of the Mediterranean Sea. We conclude that these particularities of the Mediterranean Sea are responsible for the overestimated SST based on TEX86. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Archaea; Isoprenoid GDGTs; Marine Euryarchaeota group II; Mediterranean Sea; Paleothermometer; TEX86; Thaumarchaeota","Glycerol; Lipids; Microorganisms; RNA; Seawater; Surface waters; Archaea; Isoprenoids; Marine Euryarchaeota group II; Mediterranean sea; Paleothermometer; TEX86; Thaumarchaeota; Oceanography; chemical composition; isoprenoid; marine ecosystem; paleotemperature; prokaryote; thermometry; water column; Mediterranean Sea; Archaea; Euryarchaeota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068204894

The seismic observations and interpretations point to an unusually vast fossil system of pipes. These features are exceptional in number (&gt;2000 edifices) and appear to have formed from a common root zone. The areal extent of the analysed pipe system (2500 km2) is among the largest systems of fluid expulsion features ever observed in three-dimensional seismic data. The unclustered distribution of the pipes suggests no specific link to faults or buried sedimentary features and, at their maximum vertical development, the pipes are equally distributed above depocentres or structural highs. The majority of pipes terminate at two discrete levels in the late Paleocene. Based on the geometrical relationship of the pipe edifices to the overburden, and the basinal setting of the hosting units, we interpret these horizons as representing the seabed at the time of pipe formation. This interpretation allows us to date the timing of pipe formation as prominently late Paleocene. We envisage that the pipes originated during discrete episodes of fluid venting in this time interval, disrupting the typical progressive basinal compaction-driven pore fluid expulsion. The pipes are associated with biogenic gas expulsion. We discuss their triggers, mechanical processes, and global significance for understanding fluid flow processes in sedimentary basins. Creation of the initial overpressure could be related to in situ biogenic gas generation in the stratigraphic interval coincident with the root zone of the pipes. We hypothesise that the main episode of gas release and pipe formation was associated with a sea-level fall during the contemporaneous late Paleocene Carbon Isotope Maximum. This case study shows a unique example of a preserved Paleogene fluid migration system and highlights how the observation and the interpretation of massive fossil systems of fluid-escape features provides invaluable information in terms of overpressure generation and basin fluid expulsion history. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogenic gas; Canterbury Basin; Fluid expulsion; Great South Basin; New Zealand; Paleocene; Pipes","Biological materials preservation; Buildings; Gas generators; Pipe; Sea level; Sedimentology; Seismic prospecting; Seismology; Stratigraphy; Biogenic gas; Canterbury Basin; Great South Basin; New zealand; Paleocene; Flow of fluids; biogas; data interpretation; depocenter; fluid expulsion; geometry; hydrocarbon generation; hydrocarbon migration; Paleocene; pipe; sedimentary basin; seismic data; spatial distribution; Canterbury Basin; Canterbury [South Island]; Great South Basin; New Zealand; Pacific Ocean; South Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067199627

They have developed integrated strategies harnessing the power of information and communication technologies (ICT) as part of the move towards smart(er) cities. In spite of our knowledge of the role of technological infrastructure in tackling climate change, the role of governance mechanisms to actively pursue environmental sustainability is often understated. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyse governmentality mechanisms developed by a small town in Europe to render energy savings and new energy sources visible and to create new identities with which the citizen and other cities could then identify with, thereby participating in the fight against climate change. Design/methodology/approach: Data were gathered through non-participant observation, interviews and access to internal data from the city’s energy control project. Findings: The outcome of these governmentality mechanisms was to create two new identities: the “good citizen”, responsible to lower his impact on climate change, and the “model city”, a laboratory that would serve as a guide for future policies to tackle climate change at the city level. While the “model city” was successful and identification happened with other small cities taking example from it, the “good citizen” failed and inhabitants did not identify with this role model that was defined for them as a way to participate in the fight against climate change. Practical implications: This case study is a concrete example, based on a longitudinal study, of a city’s strategy and actions on climate change. Other small cities will be able to use this case study to gauge their possibilities for action on climate change. Notably, it is an example of how a network of mechanisms can achieve results in CO2 emissions reduction. It also demonstrates the difficulty to enrol citizens into an environmental sustainability scheme. Social implications: This paper has implications for how climate change can be tackled in rural areas by small cities. While the role of organizations and large cities (e.g. C40 city network) has been acknowledged, there is a possibility for smaller local actors to act upon grand challenges with local strategies and their own governmentality mechanisms. Originality/value: The case study contributes to the literature on cities, bringing new insights into how they can become actors of climate change beyond acting on internal controls, and the literature on governmentality by demonstrating how mechanisms can act upon a population without being calculative. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate change; Environmental sustainability; Governmentality; Materiality; Public management; Smart cities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070358386

The newly designed partially premixed combustion concept has demonstrated its potential for reducing NOx and particulate matter emissions combined with high indicated efficiencies while still retaining proper control over combustion process by using different injection strategies. In this study, parametric variations of injection pressure, second injection and third injection timings were experimentally performed to analyze the effect of the injection strategy over the air/fuel mixture process and its consequent impact on gaseous compound emissions and particulate matter emissions including its size distribution. Tests were carried out on a newly designed two-stroke high-speed direct injection compression-ignition engine operating with the partially premixed combustion concept using 95 research octane number gasoline fuel. A scanning particle sizer was used to measure the particles size distribution and the HORIBA 7100DEGR gas analyzer system to determine gaseous emissions. Three different steady-state operation modes in terms of indicated mean effective pressure and engine speed were investigated: 3.5 bar indicated mean effective pressure and 2000 r/min, 5.5 bar indicated mean effective pressure and 2000 r/min, and 5.5 bar indicated mean effective pressure and 2500 r/min. The experimental results confirm how the use of an adequate injection strategy is indispensable to obtain low exhaust emissions values and a balance between the different pollutants. With the increase in the injection pressure and delay in the second injection, it was possible to obtain a trade-off between NOx and particulate matter emission reduction, while there was an increase in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions under these conditions. In addition, the experiments showed an increase in particle number emissions and a progressive shift in the particles size distribution toward larger sizes, increasing the accumulation-mode particles and reducing the nucleation-mode particles with the decrease in the injection pressure and delay in the third injection. © IMechE 2018.","gaseous emissions; gasoline partially premixed combustion concept; injection strategy; particle number emissions; particle size distribution; Two-stroke engine","Carbon monoxide; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Ignition; Light transmission; Nitrogen oxides; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Particulate emissions; Size distribution; Compression ignition engine; High speed direct injections; Indicated mean effective pressure; Partially premixed combustion; Particle number emission; Particles size distribution; Particulate matter emissions; Two-stroke engine; Direct injection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060649134

The provision of information to support climate-relevant decision-making requires an understanding of the projected impacts of change and complex feedbacks within the local ecosystems, as well as local demands on ecosystem services. In this paper, we address the limitation of current approaches for developing management relevant socio-ecological information on the projected impacts of climate change and human activities. We emphasise the need for linking disciplines and approaches by expounding the methodology followed in our two consecutive projects. These projects combine disciplines and levels of measurements from the leaf level (ecophysiology) to the local landscape level (flux measurements) and from the local household level (socio-economic surveys) to the regional level (remote sensing), feeding into a variety of models at multiple scales. Interdisciplinary, multi-scaled, and integrated socio-ecological approaches, as proposed here, are needed to compliment reductionist and linear, scale-specific approaches. Decision support systems are used to integrate and communicate the data and models to the local decision-makers. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Ecosystems; Land use; Remote sensing; Surveys; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Flux measurements; Human activities; Regional levels; Socio-ecological; Socio-economic factor; Vulnerable groups; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; decision making; ecosystem management; human activity; interdisciplinary approach; rural area; Southern Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073566505

Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) in arid and semi-arid environments is frequently affected by harsh environmental stresses such as heat, drought and salinity, which limit its growth and productivity and affect biological nitrogen fixation ability of rhizobia. Climate change had further aggravated these stresses. Inoculation with appropriate stress tolerant rhizobia is necessary for an environmentally friendly and sustainable agricultural production. In this study, endophytic bacteria isolated from chickpea nodules from different soil types and regions in Morocco, were evaluated for their phenotypic and genotypic diversity in order to select the most tolerant ones for further inoculation of this crop. Phenotypic characterization of 135 endophytic bacteria from chickpea nodules showed a wide variability for tolerance to heavy metals and antibiotics, variable response to extreme temperatures, salinity, pH and water stress. 56% of isolates were able to nodulate chickpea. Numerical analysis of rep-PCR results showed that nodulating strains fell into 22 genotypes. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene of endophytic bacteria from chickpea nodules revealed that 55% of isolated bacteria belong to Mesorhizobium genus. Based on MLSA of core genes (recA, atpD, glnII and dnaK), tasted strains were distributed into six clades and were closely related to Mesorhizobium ciceri, Mesorhizobium opportunistum, Mesorhizobium qingshengii, and Mesorhizobium plurifarium. Most of nodulating strains were belonging to a group genetically distinct from reference Mesorhizobium species. Three isolates belong to genus Burkholderia of the class β- proteobacteria, and 55 other strains belong to the class γ- proteobacteria. Some of the stress tolerant isolates have great potential for further inoculation of chickpea in the arid and semiarid environments to enhance biological nitrogen fixation and productivity in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation. © Copyright © 2019 Benjelloun, Thami Alami, Douira and Udupa.","beta proteobacteria; Cicer arietinum; endophytic bacteria; gamma proteobacteria; MLSA; rhizobia","RNA 16S; soil organic matter; 16s rrna gene; agricultural inoculation; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium isolation; chickpea; climate change; crop production; DNA isolation; electric conductivity; environmental stress; gel electrophoresis; gene sequence; genetic distance; genetic fingerprinting; genetic variability; genotype; instrument sterilization; Morocco; morphological trait; nitrogen fixation; nodulation; nonhuman; pH; phenotype; plant growth; repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction; RNA sequence; salinity; soil analysis; symbiosis; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072899123

This topic has been taken up equally by professionals as well as the general public. Adaptation and mitigation actions are needed, especially in cities where the concentration of population and an increased demand for resources (e.g., water, food, land) are expected in the coming years. Already, 400 cities have been declared to be in a ""climate emergency"" state. There are no longer any doubts that current environmental state requires actions and solutions for both the alarming climate situation and urban quality life development. If such action is not going to be taken, the environmental state will deteriorate. One possible solution could be the use of green infrastructure. This research compares approaches to green areas and green infrastructure development in Bratislava (Slovakia) and Wrocław (Poland). A comparison was made for projects realized between 2013 and 2018-i.e., since the publication of the European Union (EU) Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change in 2013. The research presents an overview of delivered projects regarding land use. The overview, which is supported by a density map of implemented green projects, verifies whether the new greenery fits and fills in the existing natural areas. Secondly, the green projects were analyzed according to years and land use types using Tableau software. Moreover, the legislation of climate adaptation mechanisms and practical aspects of green infrastructure implementation are shown. Finally, actions concerning the greening of the cities were categorized into practical, educational, and participatory ones, and the potential of green infrastructure as a positive landscape, micro-climate, health, and aesthetic influence was examined. © 2019 by the authors.","Cities; Climate adaptation; Climate change; Climate emergency; Green infrastructure; Sustainability","Land use; Sustainable development; Adaptation mechanism; Adaptation to climate changes; Cities; Climate adaptation; Climate change adaptation; Climate emergency; Environmental state; Green infrastructure; Climate change; adaptation; climate change; greenspace; mitigation; quality of life; sustainability; urban development; Bratislava; Bratislavsky; Dolnoslaskie; Poland [Central Europe]; Slovakia; Wroclaw [Dolnoslaskie]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072253260

Earmarking revenues from carbon taxation for spending that benefits citizens (i.e., revenue recycling) might help policy makers escape this political impasse. On the basis of choice experiments with representative samples of citizens in Germany and the United States, we examine whether revenue recycling could mitigate two key obstacles to achieving sufficient public support for carbon taxes: (i) declines in support as taxation levels increase and (ii) concerns over the international economic level playing field. For both countries, we find that revenue recycling could help achieve majority support for carbon tax levels of up to $50 to $70 per metric ton of carbon, but only if industrialized countries join forces and adopt similar carbon taxes. © 2019 The Authors,",,"Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Energy policy; Global warming; Recycling; Carbon taxation; Choice experiments; Global energy; Industrialized countries; International economics; Policy instruments; Public support; Representative sample; Taxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072335427

Cover crops (CCs) have been used to scavenge surplus soil N, which might lead to a decrease in the substrate needed for N2O production from the field. The objective of this study was to determine the effect that corn-soybean rotations with different CCs, and tillage methods have on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and crop yields in Illinois, USA. The experimental design was a split-block arrangement of tillage (chisel vs. no-till) and CC rotations in a RCBD with 4 replications with the corn and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] phases present each year. Greenhouse gas emissions - nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) – soil available N, (NO3 and NH4) were sampled only during the actively growing cover crop period and from the corn phase of each rotation over a period of 4 years (2013–2017). Cover crop rotations included five corn-soybean rotations with different CCs and one with an unseeded control. Our results suggest that CC efficacy in a humid continental climate, like central Illinois, is associated with fall and winter temperature and precipitation. In two of the years, spring CC growth was poor due to unseasonably cold temperatures; however, in two of the other years, weather was favorable and spring CC biomass ranged from 2-3 Mg ha−1 from three of the species tested. Where spring CC biomass was measurable, a fivefold reduction in N2O emissions was associated to significant reductions in soil N-NO3. Corn yields were not improved with the utilization of CCs and a yield decrease of 12% occurred in the annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) rotation. The findings from this study are the first from Illinois and one of few from the Midwest showing the potential benefits CCs have in reducing GHG emissions. Moreover, given adequate growing conditions, some CC species can significantly reduce GHG emissions, decrease residual soil N, and have no negative effects on cash crop yields. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Cover crops; Greenhouse gas emissions; Methane; Midwest; Nitrous oxide","carbon dioxide; cover crop; crop production; crop rotation; crop yield; emission; experimental design; grass; greenhouse gas; limiting factor; maize; methane; nitrous oxide; phytomass; soil nutrient; soybean; Illinois; Midwest; United States; Glycine max; Lolium multiflorum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073652412

The goal of this paper is to describe the development of a parametric LCA tool for application in early design stages in the Swiss context. The envisioned users of the tool are primarily architecture and engineering students, but also practitioners. The integration of LCA throughout the design process is solved through a modular strategy. In the early stage, pre-defined components are selected to model a complete LCA. In the following design steps when more information is available, individual materials can be input with higher level of detail. The Bombyx tool is developed as a plugin for Grasshopper based on Rhinoceros3D and includes an SQL material and component database. Users are able to choose different materials and building systems and quickly modify the building's geometry while continuously receiving the calculated environmental impact in real-time. Visualization of the results, e.g. colour code indicate how the design performs in relation to a benchmark or optimization potential.

Out of the several chemical looping configurations, the co-current moving-bed reactor with iron titanium composite metal oxide particles has demonstrated a high-purity syngas production. In this study, an alternative reactor configuration (indirect chemical looping system) is proposed to the co-current moving-bed reactor system (direct chemical looping system) to enhance the syngas yield. The indirect chemical looping system consists of a fuel reactor and a syngas generation reactor, both operated in countercurrent mode, with respect to the gas-solid flow, as opposed to just one co-current fuel reactor in the direct chemical looping system. This unique gas-solid contact pattern in the indirect chemical looping system aids in greater utilization of CO2 and H2O and improves the thermodynamic performance for syngas production. Thermodynamic simulations in Aspen Plus software are performed for system analysis and comparison under isothermal and autothermal conditions. Isothermal analysis at several different temperatures and pressures, with and without co-injection of CO2/H2O, is conducted to explain the behavior of the proposed system. Autothermal operation of the system under different pressures is also evaluated to determine the maximum syngas yield within the constraints of a practical system for syngas production to further produce liquid fuels via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

Isopentenol (3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol) is one of these promising advanced biofuels that is also an important precursor for isoprene (the main component of natural rubber). In this study, we model the production cost, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and water footprint of biologically produced isopentenol, including the current state of the technology and the impact of potential improvements. We find that the minimum selling price of biobased isopentenol, given the current state of technology demonstrated at bench-scale, is $5.14/L-gasoline equivalent, and the GHG footprint exceeds that of gasoline. However, biobased isopentenol could reach a .62/L-gasoline equivalent [.4/gal-gasoline equivalent (gge), just 5% above the 10-year average gasoline price] in an optimized future case where yield and other process parameters are pushed to near their theoretical limits. In this future case, isopentenol could achieve a GHG reduction of 90% relative to gasoline and a carbon abatement cost of $9.3/metric ton CO2e. Reaching these goals will require dramatic improvements in isopentenol yield, near-100% recovery of ionic liquid used in pretreatment, and low-lignin and high-cellulose and -hemicellulose biomass feedstocks. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Aerobic fermentation; Biofuel; Biomass sorghum; Feedstock supply logistics; Ionic liquid pretreatment","Biofuels; Cellulose; Costs; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Ionic liquids; Molecular biology; Aerobic fermentation; Cellulose and hemicellulose; Feedstock supply; High energy densities; Ionic liquid pretreatment; Process parameters; Theoretical limits; Transportation fuels; Gasoline; Cellulose; Costs; Ethanol; Foreign Trade; Gasoline; Greenhouse Gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072632548

Recognizing the nexus among them may help China to formulate a targeted policy for efficient and clean energy utilization, as well as for carbon reduction. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces and seven geographical regions over the period of 1997–2015, we apply a bootstrap panel causality test to explore the cause and effect of renewable energy consumption on urbanization and economic growth in China after a cross-sectional dependence test and a slope homogeneity test. We find that China's renewable energy consumption, urbanization and economic growth in one region might be influenced by the others. However, no causality is found in 80% of provinces and 71% of geographical regions for the nexus of renewable energy consumption and urbanization, and no causality is found in 53% of provinces and 43% of geographical regions for the nexus of renewable energy consumption and economic growth. Besides, significant geographical differences are found for the nexus. Therefore, the Chinese government should not only strengthen a unified renewable energy management system to advocate regional cooperation, but also give full play to the weak joint linkages and adopt differentiated renewable energy policies according to local conditions. The interactive mechanism and a virtuous cycle among the three indicators should be established in the medium and long term to help China's energy use towards a cleaner transition. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bootstrap panel causality; Economic growth; Geographical difference; Renewable energy consumption; Urbanization","Economics; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Geographical regions; Pollution control; Renewable energy resources; Economic growths; Geographical difference; Panel causality; Renewable energy consumption; Urbanization; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066426067

A major challenge on the road to nearly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-neutral cities is the successful development of a climate action plan (CAP) by the local authority, sometimes within the framework of its participation to different initiatives (e.g. The Global Covenant of Mayors). While the identification of the best actions for reaching their long-term GHG emission reduction target constitutes a common decision-making problem for local authorities, it is also an intricate one: conflicting and incommensurable aspects such as environmental, economic, social and technical issues, as well as conflicting stakeholder interests should be dealt with simultaneously when actions have to be programmed. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods are well-known to cope with these complexities and have already been used for decades in several fields. However, they have not been systematically used within the context of local CAPs. The methodologies which are normally implemented to support the prioritisation of actions wholly or to a great extent rely on economic analyses and do not capture the potential co-impacts. In this context, this paper proposes a general participatory framework for guiding collaborative prioritisation of actions as a methodology to help local authorities with the development of more sustainable CAPs, while using MCDA. Finally, advantages, limitations and further steps in research regarding the proposed framework are discussed. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The amount of potential fresh water is decreased by sedimentation of clays and/or soil in the dam’s reservoirs. It is estimated at 70 million m3, surface evaporation and water loss by the banks and foundations. In this study, the environmental stable and radioactive isotopes together with geochemical and piezometric data were used to assess the impact of Zerrar dam on groundwater in Essaouira basin (western Morocco). The water facies has been determined and has evolved from Na–Cl type (before the establishment of the dam) to Mg–Cl and Ca–Cl type (after establishment). The dissolution of evaporates and ion exchange reactions are the main processes affecting groundwater composition. Groundwater level has been measured and shows a decline. 2H–18O diagram revealed that the aquifer recharge has assured by precipitation of oceanic origin without evaporation and by infiltration from Ksob Wadi. 3H and 14C content shows that this recharge is generally recent and the age of the waters ranges between modern and 2.3 BP (ka). However, the Zerrar dam indirectly influences the groundwater quality of the study area, because this one decreases the flow of the Ksob Wadi that is the main recharge source of the aquifer during rainfall. In addition, this Wadi flow suffers the effect of climate change, which decreases the flow of the Ksob Wadi (river) that adds to the effect of the dam. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Essaouira basin; Geochemistry; Morocco; Piezometry; Semi-arid zone; Stable isotope; Zerrar dam","aquifer; evaporation; groundwater; hydrogeochemistry; piezometer; semiarid region; stable isotope; Atlantic Ocean; Essaouira Basin; Marrakech-Safi; Morocco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071585264

However, due to the emissions standards established by environmental regulatory authorities, N.G treatment has become more crucial. Amongst the established CO2 separation strategies, the cryogenic CO2 removal techniques are promising due to environmentally friendliness, high N.G purification, low footprint values, no chemical reaction involved and capable of handling N.G with high CO2 content. Design and operation of a cryogenic process require accurate thermodynamic knowledge along with the understanding of the phase behavior of CO2 with light alkanes to make the process cost–effective. Furthermore, the study of frosting and liquefaction behavior of CO2 or CO2–alkanes mixture is significant for the energy minimization and smooth operation of the cryogenic CO2 removal from N.G. This paper provides a critical review of the available experimental and predicted thermodynamic data for CO2–alkanes mixtures at different conditions. The significance of pressure–temperature (PT), pressure–composition (P–xy), and temperature–composition (T–xy) phase diagrams for CO2–alkane mixtures are discussed in this paper.

Initially, steady-state experimental data with nominal engine settings revealed HVO benefits as a drop-in fuel. Under these conditions, pure HVO results in lower engine-out PM emissions, lower CO2 emissions, and lower mass-based FC, while the respective NOx emissions present a mixed trend. In mid loads and speeds NOx emissions of HVO are lower while at higher loads and speeds are slightly higher compared to conventional diesel. At a second step, a combustion model was developed, in order to investigate the possible re-adjustments of IT (Injection Timing) and EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) settings in order to exploit HVO's properties for further reduction of emissions and FC. The results of the combustion model in steady-state conditions showed clear reductions in NOx (up to 50%), PM (up 70%) to and CO2 (up to 7%) emissions with HVO, when IT and EGR are recalibrated compared to market diesel at default engine settings. The investigation was extended with a vehicle simulation model, aiming to examine the performance of the recalibrated engine over the WLTP and the NEDC, focusing on CO2 emissions and FC. New FC tables were built as output of the combustion model for the re-adjusted IT and EGR and were implemented in the vehicle model. According to the results, the improved IT and EGR settings for HVO, lead to lower CO2 emissions (4% in WLTP and 2.5% in NEDC) and FC (3.9% in WLTP and 2% in NEDC) compared to diesel at nominal engine settings. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

This creates conditions in which the idea of temperature ‘overshoot and peak-shaving’ is emerging as a possible strategy to meet the Paris goal. An overshoot and peak-shaving scenario rests upon the ‘temporary’ use of speculative solar radiation management (SRM) technologies combined with large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Whilst some view optimistically the strategic interdependence between SRM and CDR, we argue that this strategy comes with a risk of escalating ‘climate debt’. We explain our position using the logic of debt and the analogy of subprime mortgage lending. In overshoot and peak-shaving scenarios, the role of CDR and SRM is to compensate for delayed mitigation, placing the world in a double debt: ‘emissions debt’ and ‘temperature debt’. Analogously, this can be understood as a combination of ‘subprime mortgage’ (i.e. large-scale CDR) and ‘home-equity-line-of-credit’ (i.e. temporary SRM). With this analogy, we draw some important lessons from the 2007–2009 US subprime mortgage crisis. The analogy signals that the efficacy of temporary SRM cannot be evaluated in isolation of the feasibility of large-scale CDR and that the failure of the overshoot promise will lead to prolonged peak-shaving, masking an ever-rising climate debt. Overshoot and peak-shaving scenarios should not be presented as a secured feasible investment, but rather as a high-risk speculation betting on insecure promises. Obscuring the riskiness of such scenarios is a precipitous step towards escalating a climate debt crisis. Key policy insights The slow progress of mitigation increases the attraction of an ‘overshoot and peak-shaving’ scenario which combines temporary SRM with large-scale CDR Following the logic of debt, the role of CDR and SRM in this scenario is to compensate for delayed mitigation, creating a double debt of CO2 emissions and global temperature Using the analogy of subprime lending, this strategy can be seen as offering a combination of subprime mortgage and open-ended ‘line-of-credit’ Because the ‘success’ of peak-shaving by temporary SRM hinges critically on the overshoot promise of large-scale CDR, SRM and CDR should not be discussed separately. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

If basin-, regional- or national-scale deployment of CCS is needed, it may be possible to store only a small fraction of the captured CO2 in oil and natural gas reservoirs. The vast majority would likely have to be stored in saline formations. Pressure buildup as a result of injecting CO2 into such reservoirs is expected to be an important source of risk associated with CO2 storage, and could constrain dynamic storage capacities (maximum injection rates) to be far below estimates based on access to theoretical storage resources. Estimates of CO2 storage costs based on an assumption of practical availability of the theoretical storage resource could lead to underestimation of the costs of CO2 storage. In this study, simulation results suggest that the pressure-limited dynamic CO2 storage capacity of the Mount Simon Sandstone could be less than 4% of the theoretical storage resource in this saline formation, and storage costs could be an order of magnitude higher than recent estimates. However, consideration of the geologic heterogeneity in this deep saline formation allowed definition of a high injectivity zone, and estimated costs of CO2 storage in this “sweet spot” of the reservoir approached recent estimates that did not include costs for pressure management. © 2019","Basin-scale deployment; CO2 storage costs; Geologic CO2 storage; Geologic heterogeneity; High-injectivity zone; Pressure-limited dynamic storage capacity","Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Reservoir management; Basin scale; CO2 storage; Dynamic storage; Geologic heterogeneity; Injectivity; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; estimation method; heterogeneity; hydrocarbon reservoir; pressure field; sandstone; structural geology; underground storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066942946

This paper explains how and why the community engagement process used to produce the report was just as important as the outcomes of the report itself. Modeling was undertaken, and both detailed and contextual information was provided. Inclusion of the community in developing the scenario parameters for the modeling had a number of benefits including establishing the context within which their actions would occur and focusing their efforts on options that were technically feasible, financially viable and within their capabilities to implement. This provided a focal point for the community in calling meetings and contacting stakeholders. Rather than prescribing a particular course of action, it also resulted in a toolbox of options, a range of possible solutions that is flexible enough to fit into whatever actions are preferred by the community.

Several tools have been developed to establish a method to evaluate the carbon emission related to the life cycle of road pavements. However, the lack of key basic data such as energy consumption, pollutants and carbon emissions, and accurate management policies have hindered the transition of urban roads to clean, low-carbon systems. The HERMES project aims to compile long-term dynamic inventory of urban road energy consumption and environmental emissions and build a life cycle model. The Data Envelopment Analysis model will be used to predict the energy saving and emission reduction potential of urban roads depending on the technological solution, establish a multi-criteria evaluation system that includes energy, environment, and economic parameters, identify the best available technological solution in different cities, and propose a more targeted and effective clean low-carbon management policies.

South Africa is a developing country with high levels of air pollution in some regions, and the costs of air pollution on human health and economic growth in South Africa are still uncertain. The environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP)model was applied to South Africa using local data on population, mortality rates, and concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as well as mortality risk coefficients from the epidemiological literature. BenMAP estimates the number of premature deaths that would likely have been avoided if South African air quality levels met the existing annual National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)of 20 μg m−3, and the more stringent World Health Organization (WHO)guideline for annual average PM2.5 of 10 μg m−3. We estimate 14,000 avoided premature mortalities in 2012 if all of South Africa met the existing NAAQS annual average standard for PM2.5. These avoided cases of mortality have an estimated monetary value of $14.0 billion (US2011$), which is equivalent to 2.2% of South Africa's 2012 GDP (PPP, US2011$). We estimate 28,000 avoided premature mortalities if the more stringent WHO guideline for annual average PM2.5 is met across South Africa, which when expressed as a national burden is equivalent to 6% of all deaths in South Africa being attributable to PM2.5 exposure. These avoided cases of mortality have an estimated monetary value of $29.1 billion, which is equivalent to 4.5% of South Africa's 2012 GDP. These results show that there are significant public health benefits to lowering PM2.5 concentrations across South Africa, with correspondingly high economic benefits. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; BenMAP; Fine particulate matter; Mortality; South Africa","Air pollution; Air quality; Air quality standards; Developing countries; Economics; Population statistics; Public health; Risk assessment; BenMAP; Environmental benefits; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Mortality; National ambient air quality standards; South Africa; World Health Organization; Particles (particulate matter); ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); epidemiology; mortality risk; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution exposure; public health; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; article; controlled study; developing country; economic development; human; mortality rate; mortality risk; particulate matter; pollutant; practice guideline; premature mortality; productivity; public health; South Africa; World Health Organization; air pollutant; environmental exposure; particulate matter; premature mortality; South Africa; theoretical model; South Africa; Air Pollutants; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Mortality, Premature; Particulate Matter; Public Health; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066293014

Immigration of microbial taxa from drier conditions may promote seedling tolerance to drying climates. In a greenhouse experiment, we determined seedling performance of Ostrya virginiana and Betula nigra seedlings after experimentally swapping sterilized soils and local and foreign microbial inocula from nine sites over a gradient of precipitation and soil types, in well-watered and water reduced conditions. Swapping microbial inocula relative to abiotic soils along latitudinal, but not longitudinal, gradients resulted in reduced seedling biomass. Additionally, growth in water reduced conditions was maximized when pots were inoculated with microbes from drier sites. These results suggest that extirpation of local microbial taxa, and/or immigration of novel microbial taxa to a site may be detrimental to plant growth due to mismatches between microbes and soil conditions. However, immigration of drought adapted microbial taxa may provide additional drought tolerance to plant populations facing drying conditions.

Additionally, CO2 conversion to useful chemicals/fuels also possess a great potential to well match the energy demand in a sustainable manner. Hence, such exceptional benefits of harnessing CO2, by capitalizing sunlight, to valuable chemicals/fuels through photocatalysis, as one of the effective approach in the respective domain, have triggered great interest among researchers and scientific community. In this regard, utilization of customary and standard photocatalytic materials, specifically metal oxides like TiO2, are modified to provide enhanced performance, which is usually restricted due to limited intrinsic optical and physicochemical properties. To overcome such a critical issue of limited performance, several strategies like metals and non-metals doping, hetero-junctions, composites and nanostructures formation of photocatalytic materials have been investigated. Recently, with the invention of graphene and its derivatives, graphene based photocatalytic materials have been a topic of great interest, specifically for photocatalysts development and photocatalysis application. Graphene and its derivatives, due to their extraordinary physiochemical and electrical properties like high surface area, stability, anticorrosion capacity, photosensitivity, and excellent conductivity, can overcome constraints faced by traditional photocatalysts. Thus, Graphene based photocatalysts can be a feasible strategy to break new grounds in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCCR) to useful chemicals/ fuels, i.e. conversion of sunlight to fuels. Herein, a summarized overview is presented for the latest development in graphene-based photocatalysts, focusing various strategies and researches being investigated in relation to the, utility of graphene and its derivatives for solar fuels generation, particularly C1 chemicals like CO, CH4, CH3OH, and insights to their role in improving efficacy of photocatalysts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Graphene based photocatalysts; Photocatalytic activity; Photocatalytic CO2 reduction; Product selectivity; Solar fuels","Carbon dioxide; Chemicals; Fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Photocatalysis; Titanium dioxide; CO2 reduction; Environmental pollutions; Photocatalytic activities; Photocatalytic materials; Physicochemical property; Product selectivities; Scientific community; Solar fuels; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058575691

In particular, the occurrence and severity of highly localized metal degradation cannot currently be predicted and often cannot be rationalized in failure analysis. We report a first-principles model of the nature of protective iron carbonate films coupled with a detailed chemical and physical characterization of such a film in a carefully controlled environment. The fundamental building blocks of the protective film, siderite (FeCO3) crystallites, are found to be very sensitive to the growth environment. In iron-rich conditions, cylindrical crystallites form that are highly likely to be more susceptible to chemical attack and dissolution than the rhombohedral crystallites formed in iron-poor conditions. This suggests that local degradation of metal surfaces is influenced by structures that form during early growth and provides new avenues for the prevention, detection, and mitigation of carbon steel corrosion. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","corrosion; DFT; iron carbonate; morphology; protection; scale; siderite; thermodynamics","Atomic physics; Carbonation; Chemical attack; Corrosion; Corrosion prevention; Crystallites; Degradation; Iron compounds; Iron ores; Morphology; Steel corrosion; Thermodynamics; First principles models; Fundamental building blocks; Iron carbonates; Physical characterization; protection; Protective iron carbonate films; scale; siderite; Corrosion protection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072035404

Ethanol is the main additive for gasoline in the United States, and gasoline containing 10 vol% ethanol is the most commonly used transportation fuel. However, the vapor pressure of these blends is significantly higher than gasoline, which contributes to evaporative emissions. One way to circumvent this and other issues is to use a dual-alcohol approach, mixing lower (methanol or ethanol) and higher alcohols with gasoline to obtain a blend with a vapor pressure close to that of the base gasoline. The goal of this study was to evaluate the fuel potential of dual alcohol blends experimentally and theoretically. Ten dual-alcohol blends were tested at blending ratios from 10 to 80 vol%, with methanol and ethanol used as the lower alcohols and iso-butanol and 3-methyl-3-pentanol as the higher alcohols. The corresponding single alcohol-gasoline blends were also evaluated. For each blend, Reid vapor pressure, vapor lock protection potential, distillation curve, lower heating value, kinematic viscosity, and water tolerance at three temperatures were measured. A model of droplet evaporation was also applied to provide insights into the azeotropic volatility behavior and mixing/sooting potential of the blends. The results of this study show that it is advantageous to use dual-alcohol blends containing up to 40 vol% because they have the characteristics necessary for good performance in existing spark-ignition engines, particularly in terms of volatility, kinematic viscosity, and water tolerance. This study is the first to characterize matched vapor pressure, dual-alcohol blends over a wide blending range as drop-in fuels for conventional spark ignition engines. Furthermore, this was the first investigation of the fuel potential of iso-butanol in dual-alcohol blends and of 3-methyl-3-pentanol in single- and dual-alcohol blends. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","3-Methyl-3-pentanol; Distillation curve; Droplet evaporation; Dual-alcohol; Fuel properties; Gasoline blend; Iso-butanol; Vapor liquid equilibrium; Volatility","Alcohol fuels; Blending; Calorific value; Distillation; Drops; Engines; Ethanol; Evaporation; Fuel additives; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrostatic pressure; Kinematics; Methanol; Phase equilibria; Vapor pressure; Viscosity of liquids; 3-Methyl-3-pentanol; Distillation curves; Droplet evaporation; Fuel properties; Gasoline blends; Volatility; Gasoline",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065059133

The current study utilises the system-generalised method of moments to investigate the direct and indirect effect of financial development on carbon emissions for 46 sub-Saharan Africa countries over the period 2000–2015. Using several indicators of financial development, the empirical results reveal that financial development measured using broad money, domestic credit to the private sector and domestic credit to private sector by banks increase carbon emissions while FDI, liquid liabilities and domestic credit to private sector by financial sector do not affect carbon emissions. The results show that none of the financial development indicators exerts a significant nonlinear effect on carbon emissions. The results further indicate that FDI moderates economic growth to reduce carbon emissions but does not moderate energy consumption to affect carbon emissions. Contrarily, financial development measured using broad money, domestic credit to private sector by banks, domestic credit to private sector by financial sector and domestic credit to private sector moderate energy consumption to increase carbon emissions while the first three indicators of financial development moderate economic growth to increase carbon emissions. The results do not confirm the existence of the EKC hypothesis but confirm that population size, energy consumption, trade openness, urbanisation and economic growth increase carbon emissions.

HOMER simulation software is used to determine the economic feasibility of the systems. The simulations were focused on net present cost which includes cost of energy (COE) and renewable fraction of the hybrid configurations. The results indicate that the wind/PV/diesel/battery hybrid renewable system configuration is the optimum system, primarily based on COE and achieving a 61.4% renewable energy fraction. The proposed hybrid power system not only exhibits better performance in fuel consumption but also reduces carbon dioxide emissions. It could mitigate the emission of 664 tons of greenhouse gases to the local atmosphere of the village, as well as other air pollution emissions, which could offer substantial benefit to both residence and environment. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis shows that a rise in fuel prices will derive more demand for alternative energy sources.

This effect enhances the relative contribution of ion electrosorption to the total charge storage process. Hydrogen chemisorption is reduced in aqueous 8.0 m NaNO3 due to the low degree of hydration of the Na+ cation; consequently, less free water is available for redox contributions, driving the system to exhibit electrical double-layer capacitive characteristics. Hydrogen adsorption/desorption is facilitated in 1.0 m NaNO3 due to the high molar ratio. The excess of water shifts the local pH in carbon nanopores to neutral values, giving rise to a high overpotential for dihydrogen evolution in the latter. The dilution effect on local pH shift in 1.0 m NaNO3 can be reduced by decreasing the temperature. A symmetric activated carbon cell assembled with 8.0 m NaNO3 exhibits a high capacitance and coulombic efficiency, a larger contribution of ion electrosorption to the overall charge storage process, and a stable capacitance performance at 1.6 V. © 2019 The Authors.
