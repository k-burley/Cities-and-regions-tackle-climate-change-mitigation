This chapter describes and discusses the approaches that have been reported in the literature. The steady-state characteristics of the cerebral autoregulation can be determined by changing the blood pressure level, and calculating the response of the vasomotors. Moreover, the lower limit of the autoregulatory 'plateau' can be investigated after lowering the blood pressure by pharmacological means. The excellent time-resolution of the TCD technique also facilitates the determination of the quasi-stationary and dynamic aspects of the autoregulatory response. The leg-cuff method shows that regulatory action is very fast, compensating for a sharp drop in blood pressure within seconds. Less intrusively, the autoregulatory characteristics can be assessed from recordings of spontaneous variations in blood pressure. Transfer function methods describe the faster aspects of the mechanism, while correlation techniques reveal the quasi-stationary characteristics. However, the repeatability and accuracy of methods based on spontaneous fluctuations are probably less than those of stimulus-response tests. In this chapter, the various CO2 and acetazolamide approaches that determine vasomotor reactivity are described and discussed.",,"carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase inhibitor; diagnostic agent; adrenergic system; blood pressure; brain artery; brain circulation; Doppler echography; drug effect; echography; homeostasis; human; innervation; metabolism; methodology; physiology; review; standard; vasoconstriction; Blood Pressure; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors; Cerebral Arteries; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Homeostasis; Humans; Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial; Vasoconstriction; Vasomotor System; MLCS; MLOWN",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247884361

However, most of this concrete is used as highway base or sent to landfills for disposal; only a very small portion of the concrete waste is reused In building construction. Considering the fact that usable natural aggregate (NA) supplies are diminishing, there will be a high demand for recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) to be used in the so called ""green concrete (GC). Using recycled concrete as aggregate will help reduce the total cost of concrete production because aggregates need not be hauled from remote locations, but obtained locally. The combination of RCA with significant quantities of fly ash or slag as replacement for Portland cement Is particularly attractive from both economic and environmental perspectives. GC will reduce the demand for natural resources, the associated energy consumption, and green house gas (GHG) emissions required to produce aggregates and cement. These reductions can be considered as one of the construction industry's major contributions to Canada's GHG emission reduction objective. Although there are some guidelines/ specifications established by different countries such as the UK and Japan, currently, there are no established guidelines for producing GC In Canada. This paper presents the environmental and economic benefits of increasing the use of GC In the construction industry and highlights the objectives of an ongoing research by the authors on GC. © 2006 IEEE.","Aggregate recycling; Green concrete; Green house gas (GHG); Recycled concrete aggregates (RCA)","Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Economic benefits; Recycled concrete aggregates (RCA); Concrete aggregates",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549101988

Because existing literature contains few measurements of methane emissions and oxidation in intermediate cover areas, this study focused on field measurement of emissions at 15-cm-thick non-vegetated intermediate cover overlying 1-year-old waste and a 45-cm-thick vegetated intermediate cover overlying 7-year-old waste. The 45 cm thick cover can also simulate non-engineered covers associated with older closed landfills. Oxidation of the emitted methane was evaluated using stable isotope techniques. The arithmetic means of the measured fluxes were 54 and 22 g CH4 m-2 d-1 from the thin cover and the thick cover, respectively. The peak flux was 596 g m-2 d-1 for the thin cover and 330 g m-2 d-1 for the thick cover. The mean percent oxidation was significantly greater (25%) at the thick cover relative to the thin cover (14%). This difference only partly accounted for the difference in emissions from the two sites. Inverse distance weighing was used to describe the spatial variation of flux emissions from each cover type. The geospatial mean flux was 21.6 g m-2 d-1 for the thick intermediate cover and 50.0 g m-2 d-1 for the thin intermediate cover. High emission zones in the thick cover were fewer and more isolated, while high emission zones in the thin cover were continuous and covered a larger area. These differences in the emission patterns suggest that different CH4 mitigation techniques should be applied to the two areas. For the thick intermediate cover, we suggest that effective mitigation of methane emissions could be achieved by placement of individualized compost cells over high emission zones. Emissions from the thin intermediate cover, on the other hand, can be mitigated by placing a compost layer over the entire area. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, fast and reliable answers can greatly enhance the effectiveness of design engineers. However, due to the complexity of many active ingredients, most property prediction models do not provide accurate results. Therefore, much design work is dominated by trial-and-error experimentation. In fact, industrial process studies groups spend as much as 30 % of their time on solubility problems. In an increasingly competitive climate reduction of this is necessary, so reliance on predicted phase equilibria based on minimum experiment is of great interest. Before complex solutes can be adequately studied, systematization of the whole area is necessary, in particular regarding the property data. In spite of its practical importance, solid-liquid equilibrium has not received as much attention in the thermodynamic community as vapor-liquid equilibrium. Nevertheless, many references especially to experimental work - exist for solid-liquid equilibria. The majority, however, are quite old. Since data generation continues to progress rapidly, new results are continuously accumulating in the literature. The time is therefore appropriate for a comprehensive presentation in which new (and older) results are made accessible. We have therefore, in collaboration begun systematically to develop a new data base of solid solubility data of binary mixtures where the solute is a mediumsized organic component and the solvent a component of lower molecular weight. The aims are to: 1. establish a comprehensive data base for solid-liquid equilibrium data with public access; 2. develop better models; 3. establish efficient data reduction procedures for solid-liquid equilibria; 4. demonstrate the usefulness of such a data compilation in formulation problems and research The paper provides a report covering the accumulated data and examples of related topics such as data reduction and applications to transport and distribution problems.",,"Binary mixtures; Data reduction; Drug products; Molecular weight; Phase equilibria; Thermodynamics; Agrochemical products; Solid solubility; Vapor-liquid equilibrium; Solubility",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748881185

As a result, the production of geothermal electricity will decrease foreign exchange expenditures, provide energy security, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The Government has established a conducive environment for Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and investors. It sees its role as bringing project opportunities to the point where private sector companies and investors will become involved, carry them through to completion and ensure long term operation and sustainability. Result of previous work carried out by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) of Eritrea and the US Geological Survey (with the financial support of USAID) at the Alid Volcanic area strongly suggested the presence of a hot upper crustal magmatic or plutonic body beneath the Alid Mountain. The MEM/USGS study determined that the overall temperature and permeability conditions of the area were favorable for the existence of an electrical grade geothermal resource. The Government of Eritrea wishes to pave the way for geothermal-based rural electrification through the installation of a pilot geothermal power plant at Alid and the identification of new prospects for additional geothermal plants in the future. The Government feels the best way to do this is to pursue a two pronged program that builds on the earlier work at Alid and includes: (A) siting, drilling between 1-3 geothermal exploration wells and carrying out the related resource analysis and modeling at Alid; and (B) implementing a geothermal reconnaissance survey to outline potential geothermal resources in the Nabro-Dubbi region in the eastern lowlands of Eritrea (along the Red Sea) where geothermal manifestations (fumaroles) have been identified. The regional survey should include appropriate geological, geochemical, and geophysical surveys.","Alid; Eritrea; Exploration opportunities; Geothermal; Investment opportunities; Nabro-dubbi","Electric power generation; Geological surveys; Geothermal energy; Geothermal power plants; Investments; Electrification; Energy security; Geothermal resources; Resource analysis; Geophysical prospecting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548173423

A comprehensive model for graphite nozzle erosion minimization (GNEM) and numerical code have been advanced to include three different kinetic schemes and reaction-rate data for heterogeneous surface reactions. It was found that recession rate increases almost linearly with respect to pressure due to higher rate of energy transfer, while the rate of increase depends on the choice of chemical kinetic scheme and propellant composition. For metallized propellant, the concentrations of major oxidizing species such as H 2O, OH, and CO2 are substantially reduced in comparison with non-metallized propellant. This effect reduces the thermochemical attack on graphite surface, resulting in significant reduction of the erosion rates. The overall throat recession rate of the graphite nozzle is found to be a function of both the species diffusion rate and the heterogeneous reaction rate at the surface. In order to substantially reduce the throat recession rates at high pressures, it is suggested that the boundary-layer control at the throat region must be considered. Introduction of oxidized scavenging species in the boundary layer at the throat can substantially reduce the thermochemical attack thereby reducing the nozzle throat erosion rate.",,"Chamber pressure; Erosion rate; Graphite nozzle erosion minimization (GNEM); Nozzle erosion rates; Boundary layers; Graphite; Nozzles; Numerical methods; Pressure effects; Rocket engines; Propellants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250721491

The ligands used (and the abbreviations for the resulting complexes) are 3-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole (Ru-pypz), 2,2′-bipyrimidine (Ru-bpym), 5,5′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (Ru-dmb), 1-ethyl-2-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazole (Ru-pbe), bidentate 2,2′:6′,2‴-terpyridine (Ru-tpy). The known complexes with NN = 2,2′-bipyridine (Ru-bpy) and 1,10-phenathroline (Ru-phen) were also included in this work. A series of crystallographic studies showed that the Ru(NN)(CN)42- complex anions form a range of elaborate coordination networks when crystallised with either K+ or Ln 3+ cations. The K+ salts are characterised by a combination of near-linear Ru-CN-K bridges, with the cyanides coordinating to K+ in the usual 'end-on' mode, and unusual side-on π-type coordination of cyanide ligands to K+ ions. With Ln3+ cations in contrast only Ru-CN-Ln near-linear bridges occurred, affording 1-dimensional helical or diamondoid chains, and 2-dimensional sheets constituted from linked metallamacrocyclic rings. All of the K2Ru(NN)(CN) 4 complexes show a reversible Ru(ii)/Ru(iii) couple (ca. +0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl in water), the exception being Ru-tpy whose oxidation is completely irreversible. Luminescence studies in water showed the presence of 3MLCT-based emission in all cases apart from Ru-bpym with lifetimes of tens/hundreds of nanoseconds. Time-resolved infrared studies showed that in the 3MLCT excited state the principal C-N stretching vibration shifts to positive energy by ca. 50 cm-1 as a consequence of the transient oxidation of the metal centre to Ru(iii) and the reduction in back-bonding to the cyanide ligands; measurement of transient decay rates allowed measurements of 3MLCT lifetimes for those complexes which could not be characterised by luminescence spectroscopy. A few complexes were also examined in different solvents (MeCN, dmf) and showed much weaker emission and shorter excited-state lifetimes in these solvents compared to water. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006.",,"Crystallography; Cyanides; Luminescence; Molecular structure; Organic compounds; Positive ions; Ruthenium compounds; Water; Ligands; Metallamacrocyclic rings; Photophysical properties; Pyrazole; Complexation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645544202

However, a strong increase of carbon monoxide emissions (CO) is frequently noted in combination with enhanced homogenization. Therefore, the current investigation focuses on a detailed analysis of the particulate - CO trade-off using a laser-optical and multidimensional CFD investigation of the combustion process of a swirl HSDI system. The CFD methodology involves reduced kinetics for soot formation and oxidation and a three-step CO model. These models are validated by a detailed comparison to optical measurements of flow, spray penetration and the spatial distribution of soot, temperature and oxygen concentration. The results obtained show that high concentrations of CO occur as an intermediate combustion reaction product. Subsequently, CO and soot are oxidized in large areas of the combustion chamber. In part load operation, CO emissions are mainly caused by dilution effects in the early phases of combustion. However, the engine's soot emissions are caused by insufficient oxidization. Soot generation and oxidation are found to be strongly impacted by the slight non-homogeneity of the swirl motion. The gaseous emissions are not affected by the small differences in local flow, which are outlined further in the text.

Although, much has been achieved for thermal NOx, which is caused mainly by the conversion of the nitrogen of the air in high temperature regions, less work has been devoted to the reduction of fuel NOx, which has as a main source the fuel bound nitrogen FBN, namely ammonia in case of biomass. Reducing the conversion of the FBN to NOx has been the main issue in recent research work. However, fuel NOx could be reduced significantly applying methods; like washing the gas in a scrubber prior its entrance to the combustor, and SNCR or SCR methods applied at the exhaust. But those solutions stay very expensive in terms of polluted waste water and catalyst cost. In this paper, the approach is to reduce the conversion of FBN to NOx inside a newly designed combustor. The idea is to optimize the combustion process ending up with the lowest possible conversion of FBN to NOx. The LCV gas used in the experiments described in this paper is made by mixing CO, CO2, H 2, natural gas and N2 with proportions comparable to those of the real LCV gas. This gas is then doped with NH3 to simulate the FBN. In this paper the conversion ratio of FBN to NOx versus the FBN concentration is presented. Furthermore, the system is investigated in terms of the effect of CH4 concentration on the conversion of FBN to NO x. And measurements along the combustor axis were performed with a traversing probe where temperature and important emissions along the axis were measured. In all the experiments described in the paper, The LCV gas has an HHV (High Calorific Value) ranging from 4 to 7Mj/nm3. The newly designed combustor contains an embedded inner cylinder. In these experiments, all the experiments presented are without that embedded cylinder. The purpose of the current experiments is to be compared to the later experiments with the insert in order to define clearly the effect of the inner cylinder. Furthermore, this arrangement, i.e. without the insert, gave us the opportunity to traverse the combustor by a probe and to measure temperature and species profiles, which is of a great importance in defining the key parameter controlling the conversion of NH3 to NOx.

This article analyses the impact of allocation to new entrants in the energy sector, and identifies options for improved regulation in this field. The point of departure for the discussion is a comparative analysis of the allocation in phase I and phase II of the EU ETS to two hypothetical energy installations located in different EU Member States. The study focuses on the Nordic countries due to their integrated energy market. The quantitative analysis was complemented by interviews with policy-makers and industry representatives. The results suggest that current allocation rules can significantly distort competition. The annual value of the allocation is comparable to the fixed investment costs for a new installation and is not insignificant compared to expected revenues from sales of electricity from the installation. The study finds that the preferred option would be that Nordic countries should not allocate free allowances to new entrants in the energy sector. This should be combined with adjusted rules on allocation to existing installations and closures in order to avoid putting new installations at a disadvantage. A second, less-preferred choice would involve harmonized benchmarks across the Nordic countries. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Allocation; Competitiveness; Emissions trading; New entrants","competitiveness; emissions trading; energy market; energy policy; environmental economics; European Union; incentive; quantitative analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249334635

After-treatment solutions are expensive and very complex to implement, while the NO x/PM trade-off is difficult to optimise for conventional Diesel engines. Therefore, in-cylinder pollutant production limitation by the HPC combustion mode (Highly Premixed Combustion) - including Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) - represents one of the most promising ways for new generation of CI engine. For this combustion technology, control based on torque estimation is crucial: the objectives are to accurately control the cylinder-individual fuel injected mass and to adapt the fuel injection parameters to the in-cylinder conditions (fresh air and burned gas masses and temperature). The main goal is to preserve a precise torque balance during all engine working modes. 1D engine models are an essential tool to improve controller development efficiency, as they allow to easily sweep a large amount of operating conditions and to access accurate information on engine behavior. As a matter of fact, extending the part of the numerical models into the control design process can reduce the algorithm development time and the risks of damaging the prototype hardware. The contribution of this paper is twofold: The design of a 4 cylinder HPC Diesel engine model: A specific validation of the combustion model is achieved for HCCI/conventional dual mode combustion by a study of model accuracy to reproduce the main combustion parameter variations such as SOI, injected fuel mass or burned gas rate. Then, a complete validation campaign on relevant steady state and transient operating conditions show good agreement between engine model behavior and testbed results. The use of this model as a crucial support tool for two control development purposes: The validation of an individual cylinder AFR estimator and control using the reliable and available λ-sensor located downstream the turbine as the only measurement is presented. The design of an EGR observer in the intake manifold based on typical vehicle sensors is also achieved.

The goal of this paper was to identify the typical combustion behaviour near LBO of the burner and to develop an effective actuator that will have the necessary control authority without having adverse effects such as increased emissions. Early detection and effective extension of lean blowout (LBO) are the keys to ensure flight safety and low emissions for aero engines, and are of importance to industrial gas turbines for operation below regulated NOx limits. In addition, efficient actuation are crucial for effective active LBO control. An experimental investigation of LBO was carried out using a swirl-stabilized atmospheric combustor with separate pilot and premix gaseous fuel (natural gas) injection systems. Systematic tests were performed including measurements of pressure, OH chemiluminescence and emissions for different combustor lengths, fuel split ratios, preheat temperatures and air flow rates. Operation near LBO may involve excitation of undesired thermoacoustic instabilities that have to be mitigated. LBO was approached by reducing the fuel flow rate while keeping the air flow rate, the preheat temperature and the other parameters constant. Control of the LBO and thermoacoustic instabilities was achieved by generating periodic flame balls. The LBO could be extended by 13% relative to the natural lean blowout limit at nearly 50% reduced NO emission in comparison to common pilot fuel modulation. A spark discharge system was installed at the pilot fuel injection location. The periodic spark discharge was synchronized with the puhedfuel injection at a phase, shift of 165° and an operating frequency of 22 Hz to produce flame balls that affected the main combustion region. The flame balls excitation provided an effective tool for controlling the premix combustion characteristics at the LBO.

Although this means a dramatic increase in energy efficiency, liquid or gaseous fossil fuels are used. At the same time, there is interest in using solid biomass for electricity production in a distributed generation scheme. Unfortunately, conventional gas turbines can not burn solid biomass. This paper presents a thermodynamic simulation of a pressurized gasification system integrated into a gas turbine Brayton cycle, in order to study the feasibility of using biomass. The critical process of burning the resulting low-calorific-value gas is experimentally scrutinized for feasibility using a LOWNOX-LPP combustor and a synthetic gas. The results are promising. The thermochemical processing of biomass gasification using air produces a fuel barely suitable for gas turbines. Biomass gasification using air with no cooling provides outlet temperatures in the range from 700 K to 900 K and heat values of around 6 MJ/kg, being the tar content low and in a gaseous state, especially with down-draft moving bed gasifiers. Fuel gas cleaning is possible in a cyclone particle separator without previous cooling. This system requires a special design to bear the high temperature and to separate the ash particles down to turbine tolerance, without causing too much pressure loss and clogging. Additional hot filtering using porous media is also feasible. Two benefits arise due to high temperature cleaning. Firstly, tars do not condense but burn in the combustor increasing the biogas calorific value. Secondly, the thermal enthalpy from gasification is recovered. Therefore, the whole biomass primary energy is injected in the working gases, except heat losses. On the other hand, the gasification reactor needs to work pressurized (at a slightly higher pressure than the combustor pressure) thus requiring an additional power to overcome the head loss caused by the biomass bed and the cyclone particle separator. Thermodynamic analysis shows that under favourable conditions, a fall of around 1 % of the overall efficiency appears. The heat value of gas and fuel-to-air ratio of the mixture affect flame stability inside the combustor. Nevertheless, with a swirl stabilized flame it has been demonstrated that it is possible to obtain stable flames down to 6 MJ/kg heating value with low CO and NO x emissions. For these preliminary experiments synthetic gases representing gasifiers output have been used. Using the integrated scheme here studied for feasibility, off-the-shelf gas turbines could be transformed into biomass burning micro-cogenerators, thus contributing to greenhouse gases emission reduction.

A significant component of this project included understanding the issues associated with distributed generation connected to the local utility grid and how this would impact both the customer and the grid. An added benefit would be to provide a fuel cell education site that is accessible to other Austin Energy customers and the general public. The site selected for the project is the city-owned Rebekah Baines Johnson Health Center, which houses the city health clinic. Because the Health Center had existing redundant 1,000,000 Btu per hour boilers for Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning, (HVAC) desiccant drying, and building heat along with a domestic hot water heater, the site presented an opportunity for using the waste heat generated by the fuel cell power plant in a combined heat and power application. Using a federal grant of $200,000 from the Climate Change Program administered by the U. S. Department of Defense, Austin Energy installed a 200-kW UTC Power Model PC25™C fuel cell. This fuel cell was the first in Texas to feed electric power into the utility grid. Commercial operation began July 2, 2002. The issues to be worked through in many areas proved to be difficult, but doable, and many lessons have been learned along the way. The performance results have been impressive proving that this technology is not only technically viable in commercial applications but reliable as well. The lessons learned from this project have proven valuable and a number of key issues will be shared in this paper.

The TBI system is configured from CFD studies to minimize cylinder-to-cylinder air-fuel variations, enabling the lean limit to be extended as far as lambda 1.6. An in-line, six-cylinder engine with a compression ratio of 11.7:1 (up from the standard 9.65:1) over a range of speed/torque conditions was utilized, with the air/fuel ratio varied from lambda 1.2 to 1.6. Additionally, cylinder-to- cylinder air-fuel variations were measured over a range of speeds and throttle positions representing most of the steady state parts in the Euro drive-cycle for light-duty vehicles. It is shown that mixing characteristics have a considerable effect on emissions and thermal efficiency. Comparisons of thermal efficiency and specific emissions of HC, NOx, CO 2 and CO against liquid and gaseous phase LPG multipoint port injection (MPI) systems tested on the same engine show superior mixing of the throttle-body system. Notable improvements in emissions and thermal efficiencies were achieved when compared with original gasoline sequential port injection system. At lambda 1.6, NOx is low enough to meet Euro 4 standards without the need of a reducing catalyst. Best emissions observed for the TBI system were reductions of 74% for HC, 98% for NOx, 91% for CO, 40% for CO2 and a rise of 19% in thermal efficiency.

These insults are racial and gender microaggressions (Pierce, 1995). Microaggressions are cumulative in nature and can cause undue stress to students of color while privileging whites. Any one stereotype or microaggression may contain various layers of discrimination. The stress related to deciphering these layers and responding or not responding to each microaggression falls on the student of color. Indeed, Chester Pierce (1995) states, ""In and of itself a microaggression may seem harmless, but the cumulative burden of a lifetime of microaggressions can theoretically contribute to diminished mortality, augmented morbidity, and flattened confidence."". Responses to Racial Incidents by Students of Color: Students indicate responding to racial incidents in and out of the classroom in various ways. Specifically, these responses include maintaining strategic silence, separating themselves from uncomfortable situations, working hard, being motivated to prove others wrong, and engaging in confrontation. A Black female viewed her silence as both comfort and protection from wasting her time with racial incidents in class:There were a lot of times when I would just talk to [student's name] in class. And, people say, 'You guys are always talking over there, why don't you say more stuff in class?' It's like, 'Why should I? 'Why should I waste my time? You've obviously made it very clear that this is your class and the rest of us are just allowed to be here.'. An Asian American female spoke of her silence in this way: ""In class, I definitely have felt the strong desire to say something and then I don't. I can safely say that I hardly ever speak about race issues."" An Asian American female mentioned the Asian Pacific American Law Student Association (APALSA) office as a space to separate or get away from others in the law school environment: ""But in reality, it's, it's like the only place that.... I can go where I feel totally comfortable with hanging out in the office, and with people of my own race."". A Latina addressed the choice to separate out of weariness of having to deal with negative racial talk: ""Even if they're saying that we isolate ourselves, it's just because we get tired of hearing the same things...their jokes or their comments."" Another Latina chose to seek out a space of comfort with friends of color: ""It's a lot of work, it's a lot of stress, and I'm just going to do the things that I enjoy and the things that make me happy while I'm here. And if that's going out with my minority students, my minority friends...that's what I choose to do."". Choosing silence can be safe, as it minimizes the chances of being admonished for one's comments. In choosing to be silent in class and separating themselves from racially uncomfortable situations, students of color are also creating their own spaces where questions and critiques can be expressed relatively safely. Strategic silence in response to certain racial incidents can also help students to conserve their energies for future situations. The concern remains that perhaps choosing silence comes from feelings of self-doubt and from being silenced. Students of color may doubt that their experiences are valid, that they have anything intelligent to add to the conversation, or that they could possibly bring new knowledge to others. Students' silence may also negatively affect their access to traditional forms of assistance, such as going to professors' during office hours. Students seemed to choose silence and separation in response to their position of marginality. Marginalized students are often familiar with being silenced in a classroom or having their personal experiences and beliefs discounted (Solórzano &amp; Villalpando, 1998). These experiences in the classroom are in addition to the cultural deficit discourse pervasive throughout the campus, characterizing people of color as stupid, lazy, and dependent on whites. Nonetheless, in maintaining silence and separating themselves from racially uncomfortable situations, students of color appeared to be utilizing silence on their own terms. Indeed, as these students navigate successfully through law school, they demonstrate that strategic silence can be strong - stronger than words many times. Students of color at the University of Michigan gave us numerous examples of being silenced in and out of the classroom, which led to their feelings of helplessness, feeling less confident about their ability to perform in law school, and disengaging generally and in the classroom in particular. They also described feelings of isolation and alienation from the mainstream culture and social networks of the law school. A Black female law student recalled this experience in her first year of law school: The first year and first semester is so intimidating...you feel that you really don't have a place in this classroom. It's obviously a classroom for white men.... But when the person you're talking to doesn't look like you and the people sitting around you haven't come from where you come from and don't look like you, it just makes the whole thing a little bit more intimidating. An Asian American female remarked on her feelings of being silenced and not speaking out on a topic when she probably should have: ""Now I kind of feel like I'm really just a coward."" A Latina female echoed that comment: ""You interact less because of those reasons. And then you're by yourself more often. And then you just feel alone."" A Black female spoke about the perceived value of her ideas and work: ""When you're writing an exam you know that your voice or the way that you write and think was never valued all along."". In some more examples of the effects of racial incidents on academic performance, a Latina expressed how a racially polarized classroom environment affects her participation: ""I skipped class last week because I knew what the conversation in the classroom discussion [on race] was going to be like and I was so upset by even the thought of it. I knew I couldn't go."" A Black male revealed how racial incidents act upon him: ""You often are kind of fearful that you have to carry the flag and defend things."" An Asian American female shared the larger picture of the effect of racial incidents on her participation and ultimate post-law school opportunities: I think that definitely white students are privileged in the clerkship process...because you have to get recommendations...but if you don't speak in class, how is the professor going to know you? How are they going to write you a letter of recommendation? If you don't have a recommendation, you can't get a clerkship. Students of color seem to be worn down by the need to engage in ongoing strategies in order to confront the inherent stresses that accompany a negative campus racial climate. Law school can be stressful all by itself. However, these students balance school and work responsibilities while also facing racialized notions of people of color being ""lazy"" and ""unintelligent"" (Rodríguez, 1997). So far, it seems that students are developing attitudes and searching for resources that assist them to be resilient in the face of stress. Indeed, despite the negative effects of working in a negative campus racial climate, these students demonstrate that they are survivors. They have become very adept at navigating their way through the law school by ""picking and choosing their battles"" wisely. In response to the constant strain of defending themselves in face of individual and institutional forms of racism, these students just work harder. Counter Spaces and Voices as a Result of the Campus Racial Climate33Some quotes are repeated here in order to exemplify a concept.: One of the ways in which students of color navigate their way through the law school is to seek out other students for emotional or instrumental support. They seek out others who are experiencing the same incidents or who can serve as allies in the struggle to overcome the negative racial climate. For instance, these students described certain classes where faculty was able to include and not be dismissive of issues related to race and where these issues were discussed in an open and constructive manner. An Asian American female recalled one such class: ""In [professor's] class...she said she'd never seen so many students of color in a class, and she'd never seen so many students of color speak up."". An Asian American male recalled a class incident and shared the following account:This female Korean American professor - I was in the class and it seemed like people really didn't respect her at all. People attacked her all the time, much more than other professors.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646132978

A sound understanding of the physics of OBM filtrate clean-up and identification of first-order impact parameters is of paramount importance for the design of new generation WFT probes that can operate in OBM filtrate environments with enhanced efficiency. Analytical as well as numerical models reported in the formation testing literature rely predominantly on simplifying assumptions in terms of the compositions of flowing fluid phases. These models characteristically assume single-component phases in the case of two-phase immiscible formulation, or a two-/three-component hydrocarbon phase in cases of black-oil/extended black-oil formulations. In turn, compositional interactions are entirely neglected or represented through simplistic empirical correlations. Such conventional models are deemed sufficient for pre-job planning and interpretation of measurements acquired in formations subject to water-base mud (WBM) filtrate contamination. Dynamics of flow in OBM filtrate contaminated formations is significantly more complex. A time-dependent coupling between fluid dynamics and phase behavior constitutes the governing physics of OBM filtrate clean-up process. Therefore, for OBM filtrate environments, accuracy of conventional formulations in representing the actual physics of flow is limited. We have constructed a numerical model for the OBM filtrate clean-up within the framework of an equation-of-state (EOS) compositional fluid-flow simulator. Our numerical framework simultaneously honors the physics of multi-component fluid flow and the thermodynamics of phase behavior. The numerical model was verified against analytical solutions for zeroth-order models for which analytical solutions exist Simulation results exhibited close agreement with the analytical predictions and with field data for the time dependence of contamination during sampling. A rapid approximate response surface based model, which can serve as a pre-job planning or real-time analysis tool, was derived from extensive simulations conducted with the compositional numerical model. Our simulation and rapid modeling results compare well with empirical observations made in the field. In particular, the rate of change of miscible contamination with time has been found empirically to vary as t 5/12. For the first time, modeling has been shown to give essentially the same results as empirical observations. The agreement between our model and common field observation motivates use of our model to analyze the more complex WFT probes, which have recently become available.

This has led the Ministry of Energy (MOE) to evaluate various practices to reduce national electricity consumption. Accordingly, the MOE financed several projects including this one aiming at increasing energy efficiency in buildings through energy auditing. Several buildings were selected including the Ministry of Energy (MOE) Headquarters building, Public Authority for Civil Information (PACI) building and Fanar commercial complex. Energy conservation opportunities (ECO) that included implementation of energy efficient operation and maintenance strategies (O&MS) and assessment and utilization of energy conservation measures (ECM) were identified for each building. As a result of implementing the identified ECOs, energy was reduced by 12,200 MWh/year amounting to KD. 158,000/year (549,000 $/year) assuming that the actual cost of the energy unit is 13 fils/kWh ($0.045 cents/kWh). Moreover, the environmental benefit of the project included annual power plant emissions mitigation of 5246 tons of CO2. In addition to achieving the financial and environmental benefits, the project realized additional achievements including the development of energy simulation models for MOE and PACI buildings and training of MOE engineers, buildings operators and facility managers. The personal interaction and training will guarantee the continuous implementation of the project recommendations.

In Kuwait, where energy prices are highly subsidized by the Ministry of Energy (MOE), efforts to rectify national energy consumption were sought by MOE. The work discussed in this article aims to achieve efficient utilization of lighting systems by retrofitting energy intensive domestically used incandescent lamps with energy efficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). The potential of a national retrofitting program is assessed in terms of its national benefits, including financial and environmental. This assessment evaluated the retrofitting option as if the CFLs will be distributed free of charge for all local residences, as subsidized energy prices cannot justify the purchase of CFLs by house owners. The assessment revealed that in around 3.7 years, MOE will save around million KD29 (million $97). In addition, lamp retrofitting will provide demand savings of 482 MW and 145 MW during off- and on peak hours respectively. The on-peak hour demand savings represent 1.6 percent of the total installed capacity. Additional environmental benefits can be realized by reducing power plant emissions by over 500 million kg of CO2. © 2006 Energy Engineering.

Combustion noise excitation and fuel consumption have to be decreased in parallel. All these goals can be met today due to the development of advanced combustion systems and the increased flexibility of fuel injection system and ECU. But hereby, combustion system development and vehicle application have become more complex in recent times. A precise and simple description of 'combustion noise' is not trivial in this context. The customer subjective impression of e.g. diesel knock intensity, at vehicle interior and exterior, is the relevant value for this. Combustion noise excitation today is described by using the in-cylinder pressure based FEV CSL. Full calibration NVH potential is explored hereby, while meeting the emission and fuel consumption targets. FEV CSL-CAL is the in-house developed tool for NVH related vehicle calibration. All important ECU parameters are optimized simultaneous under the customer-relevant driving conditions hereby. Additionally, sound quality objective parameters for judgment of subjective combustion noise impression - FEV SQO - are used to find the optimal calibration map, for steady state as well as for cold start and during acceleration. By all this, combustion noise is described well and can be optimized toward customer expectation.

When the same percent reductions were applied across the domain to the BY inventory, maximum 8-hour ozone concentrations at 53 key sites often did not differ substantially from those obtained with the FY inventories. Correlations coefficients between ozone concentrations simulated by CAMx with the two approaches were very high (i.e., over 99%). As such, uniform emission reductions across the domain represent an effective tool to obtain estimates of ozone levels when an appropriate FY emission inventory is unavailable, especially if the change in emissions relative to the base year is relatively small (less than about 20% for this episode). Ozone bias, defined as the difference in maximum 8hour ozone concentration simulated with UR and with FY inventories, was usually positive, indicating that, on average, uniform reductions gave conservative ozone estimates. However, in 2007 (i.e., one case out of three), uniform reductions across the domain were overall more effective at reducing maximum 8-hour ozone concentrations than FY inventories. In this case, the UR method was not conservative. Of the various sub-regions, in SAC, SFB, and the northern portion of SJV, FY inventories were always more effective than uniform emission reductions. As such, it appears that local emissions in these areas were projected to be reduced more than the domain average. In contrast, in central and southern SJV, uniform emission reductions were often more effective than FY inventories at reducing ozone maxima, which indicates that, in these areas, emissions were projected to be reduced less than the domain average.",,"8-hour ozone; California; Effective tool; Emission inventories; Local emissions; Ozone concentration; Ozone levels; Sub-regions; Uniform emission; Uniform reduction; Concentration (process); Emission control; Volatile organic compounds; Ozone",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949293823

In particular, changes in temperature of several tens of degrees centigrade between the seasons, and substantial precipitation as well as permafrost conditions are common. These environmental conditions result in significant damages to the infrastructure that requires extensive maintenance. Road damage is directly related to problems associated with the foundation, frequently resulting in differential settlements, Significant increase in these problems is expected as a result of changing climate, thus reducing the expected service life of various roads in arctic regions. The highway system within the permafrost region is extremely vulnerable to these climate changes because the mechanical property of the soil changes dramatically with temperature increases and as Ice within the frozen soil thaws. This paper presents a numerical investigation of a novel approach for an improvement of road foundations resulting from convective heat flow. The proposed foundation is capable of compensating for some of the expected warming of the permafrost by storing and maintaining the cold winter temperatures through the summer months.

A comparison between the performance of different shading devices like glazing materials, external and internal shading, is accomplished. The method is demonstrated on a case study for which diagonal shading devices were found to be the best solution. The problem of optimal window shading arises in regions with hot climates. In many cases, energy saving in summer is dominated by the shading parameter more than by other design parameters, due to the reduction of cooling load during the summer. On the other hand, window overshading reduces the amount of daylighting. Also, the additional artificial illumination may increase significantly the cooling load in summer. The present work analyses the climatic and light conditions of the different options in solar control devices for windows. Taking in consideration the consumption of energy and the comfort of the occupants, the variants used in the diagnosis are studied using scale models and comparative with computer available programs, with the principal aim to demonstrate in didactic way the concepts used to the students of the career of architecture.","Bioclimatic approach; Comfort; Daylighting; Shading devices","Bioclimatic approach; Comfort; Consumption of energy; Cooling load; Design parameters; Hot climate; Light conditions; Scale models; Shading coefficient; Shading devices; Solar control; Work analysis; Air conditioning; Computer architecture; Control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Optimization; Program diagnostics; Daylighting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865776376

The cumulative effects of gradual changes in hydrology due to climatic change are expected to alter the magnitude and frequency of peak flows over the service life of drainage infrastructure. Potential future changes in rainfall intensity are expected to alter the level of service of drainage infrastructure, with increased rainfall intensity likely resulting in more frequent flooding of storm sewers and surcharging of culverts. The expected effects of climate change necessitate a change in the approach used to plan for and design drainage infrastructure. New development should ideally be served by both a minor storm drainage system, such as a traditional storm sewer system, and a major overland storm drainage system designed to convey the excess runoff when the capacity of the minor system is exceeded. The planning and design of new drainage infrastructure should incorporate development features and sustainable urban drainage systems that provide multiple benefits (such as a reduction of localized urban flooding and harmful environmental impacts). Modifications to existing drainage infrastructure in existing development is complicated by the integration of the minor drainage system with other infrastructure and a lack of space for the construction of major drainage system components. © 2006 IEEE.","Climate change; Hydrology; Stormwater; Urban drainage","Drainage; Floods; Planning; Rain; Runoff; Sewers; Flooding; Infrastructure planning; Urban drainage; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549119368

In response to Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CTDEP) administrative orders and judgments, The District embarked on an ambitious program to evaluate new and emerging mercury removal technologies to address stricter mercury emissions limits planned by CTDEP for municipal sewage sludge (biosolids) incinerators. These administrative orders and judgments imposed targets of 180 and 150 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3): CTDEP's goal is 100 ug/m3. The District evaluated a number of technologies including: Sodium tetra sulfide injection into the incinerator emissions' air stream, which has been used in several power generation plants with success; the introduction of foul air containing hydrogen sulfide, which is believed to oxidize some of the mercury in the incinerator emissions into a more stable form, enhancing overall removal rates; a static carbon bed; and, the most novel and leading edge technology, a Ultra High Efficiency traveling filter cloth system. The Carbon Bed and Ultra High Efficiency filter manufacturer's experience were with other industries, and the Ultra High Efficiency filter manufacturer's experience was not even related to power generation or sewage sludge incinerators, let alone as an add on following a wet scrubber system. This evaluation demonstrated that the Ultra High Efficiency traveling filter cloth system will remove sub-micron particles as well as mercury, and the carbon canister will remove mercury. This study has value to the industry: Jeffery Holmstead, EPA assistant administrator for air and radiation, has been quoted stating, ""Mercury control technology is not available on a commercial scale, so the agency was unable to set a MACT standard.""

Sukachev Forest Institute, Akademgorodok, 660036 Krasnoyarsk, Russian Federation","We compare assimilation and respiration rates, and water use strategies in four divergent ecosystems located in cold-continental central Siberia and in semi-arid southern Africa. These seemingly unrelated systems have in common a harsh and highly seasonal environment with a very sharp transition between the dormant and the active season, with vegetation facing dry air and soil conditions for at least part of the year. Moreover, the northern high latitudes and the semi-arid tropics will likely experience changes in key environmental parameters (e.g., air temperature and precipitation) in the future; indeed, in some regions marked climate trends have already been observed over the last decade or so. The magnitude of instantaneous or daily assimilation and respiration rates, derived from one to two years of eddy covariance measurements in each of the four ecosystems, was not related to the growth environment. For instance, respiration rates were clearly highest in the two deciduous systems included in the analysis (a Mopane woodland in northern Botswana and a Downy birch forest in Siberia; &gt; 300 mmol m-2d-1), while assimilation rates in the Mopane woodland were relatively similar to a Siberian Scots pine canopy for a large part of the active season (ca. 420 mmol m -2 d-1). Acknowledging the limited number of ecosystems compared here, these data nevertheless demonstrate that factors like vegetation type, canopy phenology or ecosystem age can override larger-scale climate differences in terms of their effects on carbon assimilation and respiration rates. By far the highest rates of assimilation were observed in Downy birch, an early successional species. These were achieved at a rather conservative water use, as indicated by relatively low levels of λ, the marginal water cost of plant carbon gain. Surprisingly, the Mopane woodland growing in the semi-arid environment had significantly higher values of λ. However, its water use strategy included a very plastic response to intermittently dry periods, and values of λ were much more conservative overall during a rainy season with low precipitation and high air saturation deficits. Our comparison demonstrates that forest ecosystems can respond very dynamically in terms of water use strategy, both on interannual and much shorter time scales. But it remains to be evaluated whether and in which ecosystems this plasticity is mainly due to a short-term stomatal response, or alternatively goes hand in hand with changes in canopy photosynthetic capacity.",,"canopy; carbon dioxide; deciduous forest; eddy covariance; gas exchange; phenology; respiration; water use; Africa; Botswana; Eurasia; Siberia; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Betula pubescens; Colophospermum mopane; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749348253

This paper presents a conceptual approach to the development of sensor arrays system with instantaneous dose and dose rate readout. A dynamic selection of multiple sensors with various sensitivity and accuracy range is implemented by applying pattern recognition (PR) analysis, which maximizes measurement accuracy. A number of relevant PR methods are discussed. Design/methodology/approach - Thick films based on NiO, ZnO, In 2O3, CeO2, TiO2, CuO and CdO are the key sensing elements in the proposed approach. Pure and carbon-doped metal oxides were screen-printed on Si wafers to form pn-heterojunctions. All devices were exposed to a disc-type 137 Cs source with an activity of 370 kBq. The values of radiation damage of pn-junctions were estimated from changes in their current-voltage characteristics. Findings - Sensors showed an increase in the values of current with the increase in radiation dose up to certain levels, exceeding these levels results in unstable dosimetric characteristics. Originality/value - The sensitivity of metal oxide films to γ-radiation exposure depends on their composition and thickness. Mixing the oxides in different proportions and the addition of conducting particles, such as carbon, alters films susceptibility to radiation. In particular, sensors based on such films have dose response characteristics with certain level of sensitivity and working dose range, conditioned by particular sensing material properties and the device structure. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Films (states of matter); Gamma radiation; Oxides; Pattern recognition; Sensors","Gamma rays; Heterojunctions; Oxides; Pattern recognition; Pattern recognition systems; Thick films; Thin films; Carbon-doped metal oxides; Films (states of matter); Radiation dose; Sensors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644530079

This process provides a method for improving conformance of injected water and CO 2 in an absolutely environmentally friendly manner. Carbonic anhydrase enzyme accelerates the hydration reaction of CO: with water. Hence, in presence of carbon dioxide and divalent ions, such as calcium, this enzyme leads to rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate. The precipitation reaction causes reduction in the permeability of the flooded regions of the reservoir. Therefore, upon subsequent injection of CO 2 and water, injected fluids would flow through the unswept parts of reservoir, improving the conformance of the injected CO: and water. Experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of various enzyme concentrations, temperature and pH on the precipitation reaction. Enzyme concentrations at 2, 4 and 8 micro mole per litter were tested. Also, effect of temperature was studied by performing experiments at room temperature, 30 °C and 55 °C. A mathematical model was developed to predict the extent of precipitation of calcium carbonate. Subsequently, coreflood experiments, using Berea sandstone cores, were conducted and the degree of reduction in the permeability of the cores was measured. Also, in order to investigate the effect of injection scheme on permeability reduction, two different methods of injection were tested. For all sets of flow experiments, the permeability of the core was reduced to less than half of its initial value.

It consisted of an array of nine EUROGAM high-purity Ge detectors in close geometry, actively shielded individually with bismuth germanate crystals.

The depth profiles of the implanted carbon in the C12 targets were determined by Rutherford backscattering for purposes of cross-section normalization and absolute determination of the E1 and E2S factors. Angular distributions of the γ decay to the O16 ground state were measured in the energy range Ec.m.=1.30-2.78 MeV and in the angular range (lab.) 30°-130°. From these distributions, astrophysical E1 and E2S-factor functions vs energy were calculated, both of which are indispensable to the modeling of this reaction and the extrapolation toward lower energies.

A method was proposed for estimating leaching as a function of the liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio in a long-term perspective (L/S 5000 l/kg). Data for changes in residue pH as a function of L/S was used in combination with pH dependent leaching data to predict leachate concentrations of Al, Ca, Cd, Ba, Mg, Ni, Pb, S, Pb, V and Zn as a function of L/S. Mass balance calculations were used to determine the element fractions leached with respect to L/S. The estimated long-term leaching from a semi-dry residue and a fly ash was compared with short-term leaching determined by batch tests at L/S 10 l/kg, both carbonated and non-carbonated versions of the residues were investigated. Generally, very high L/S ratios above 2000 l/kg were required to leach 20-30% of the solid contents. However, Ca and S were depleted at L/S 200-900 l/kg. The long-term leachate concentrations were found to either remain at the same level as the initial leaching determined by the L/S 10 batch test, or to significantly decrease compared with the initial leaching. Only Al and Zn were found to show higher leachate concentrations at L/S ratios above 3000-5000 l/kg. Carbonation generally prolonged the time needed for depletion from the solid residues; however, Ca and S were depleted faster than in the case of non-carbonated residues. This study shows that uncritical use of batch leaching data for assessing the potential leaching is highly problematic, and evaluations of residue disposal should include scenario specific quantification of the long-term leaching. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing studies indicate that small increases in weather and climate extremes have the potential to bring large increases in damages to existing infrastructure. Almost all of today's infrastructure has been designed using climatic design values calculated from historical climate data on the assumption that past extremes will represent future conditions. Changes in climate will require changes to these climatic design values, as well as larger societal changes. Uncertainties in the climate change models and in the projections on the magnitudes and directions of future changes limit abilities to design infrastructure for future conditions. Until these uncertainties in the climate change projections are reduced, it will become critically important that climatic design values be calculated as accurately as possible and that values are regularly updated to reflect the changing climate. Since uncertainty is accepted as a part of construction codes and standards, it should be possible to deal with the growing uncertainty of future climate design values through measures such as increasing safety factors, forensic analyses of extreme events and use of climate trends and climate model projections based on surrogate climate variables. © 2006 IEEE.","Adaptation; Climate change; Engineering; Infrastructure failure; Uncertainty; Weather extremes","Social aspects; Uncertainty analysis; Weather modification; Adaptation; Infrastructure failure; Weather extremes; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549083261

Consumption of natural gas has been increasing rapidly making it one of the most important energy resources in the world. During the last decade the consumption of natural gas increased by almost 25%. By 2020 natural gas is predicted to increase its world energy share to as much as 50% from the present of 22%. The scale of its reserves and its environmental advantage favor its use, (the lower carbon emissions compared to oil and coal along with other reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulates) for fast growing activities such as the precision industries and the generation of electricity. During the twenty last years, natural gas reserves have increased about twice. Industry and academic have been pursuing the chemical conversion of natural gas to higher valued products.

In this study, mitigation of carbon emissions through carbon uptake and storage in forest biomass and the use of forest biofuel for fossil fuel substitution were considered. The analysis was performed for a 3.2 million hectare region in northern Sweden. The objective was to maximize net present value for harvested timber, biofuel production and carbon sequestration. A carbon price for build-up of carbon storage and for emissions from harvested forest products was introduced to achieve an economic value for carbon sequestration. Forest development was simulated using an optimizing stand-level planning model, and the solution for the whole region was found using linear programming. A range of carbon prices was used to study the effect on harvest levels and carbon sequestration. At a zero carbon price, the mean annual harvest level was 5.4 million m3, the mean annual carbon sequestration in forest biomass was 1.48 million tonnes and the mean annual replacement of carbon from fossil fuel with forest biofuel was 61 000 tonnes. Increasing the carbon price led to decreasing harvest levels of timber and decreasing harvest levels of forest biofuel. Also, thinning activities decreased more than clear-cut activities when the carbon prices increased. The level of carbon sequestration was governed by the harvest level and the site productivity.

These packages are typically installed in acoustic enclosures, which need to be ventilated for both removing the heat rejected from the engine and package components, and properly diluting explosive gasses in case of a leak. Considering importance of safety and reliability of gas turbine equipment operating in the offshore environment, and also near industrial and populated areas, authors of the paper emphasize the need for experimental validation of a CFD prediction practice for effective ventilation of the turbine package enclosures. In a properly designed acoustic enclosure, ventilation system has to prevent overheating of the electrical and engine control components, as well as, dilution of potential fuel leakages to eliminate stagnant zones that could cause an ignition within enclosure. Conversely, an excessive flow of the vent air may result in masking local fuel leakages, which might pass undetected through explosion protection devices. Therefore, the optimum enclosure ventilation design has to be based on proper vent flow distribution to ensure acceptable temperature distribution within the enclosure, proper flow distribution to ensure no stagnation area, combined with appropriate gas detection setting. In order to achieve an optimum enclosure design, rather complex flow and heat transfer phenomena have to be studied to select the optimal configuration of the vent system. Numerical analysis of the enclosures with commercially available CFD codes is usually based on a number of simplifying assumptions and approximations. Therefore, to satisfy critical safety requirements in the offshore environment, authors of the paper emphasize role of experimental validation of the CFD predictions. The presented paper provides details of the enclosure design validation using a CFD study based on an earlier experimental validation of the numerical predictions. A midsize gas turbine package model was selected to demonstrate this procedure. The main features from the actual engine package were included in the CFD model. Effectiveness of ventilation was studied for both cold and heated engine surfaces. CFD analyses were also carried out for local CO2 injection emulating natural gas leakage. Both scenarios with CO2 and natural gas (methane) leakages were considered reducing uncertainty of predictions due to the differences in the density and buoyancy between these gasses. Based on presented study certain improvements in design of the enclosure were recommended and described in the paper.

The European Union has concluded that waste-to-energy (WTE) is a valuable source of renewable energy that also provides positive environmental attributes such as recovery of ferrous materials and reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The ability of WTE to reduce GHGs has been determined by several independent evaluations including the USEPA's and RTI's co-developed Municipal Solid Waste Decision Support Tool (DST) which uses life-cycle assessment concepts and methods to quantify the energy and environmental attributes of different MSW management options. The paper considers how WTE is compatible with other MSW management strategies while also providing a consistent supply of clean renewable energy. The quantitative analysis uses the DST to establish the energy and environmental characteristics of WTE. The environmental analysis includes criteria pollutants (particulate, NOx, SO 2 and CO), air toxics, greenhouse gases (CO 2 and CH 4) and fine particulate (PM 2.5) precursors. Policy makers should be interested in having independent quantitative information for both energy and environmental parameters when developing a long range plan for MSW management and renewable energy. These independent results demonstrate that the WTE can be an important component when considering the goal of energy dependence.

At 1.2V steady state, the catalysation of carbon did not significantly increase the rate of carbon corrosion. However, corrosion rates of the low area carbon was 1/20th that of the high-area carbon. Under dynamic cycling, the stability of small Pt particles was found to be poor due to dissolution/sintering on the high-area carbon, however the PtCo alloy particles were found to be very stable on both the high-area and low-area carbons.

Sufficient climate adaptation efforts will require funding at two or three orders of magnitude above the current levels. For rapid-onset climate events, current ex-post disaster finance does not offer strong incentives for risk reduction. This article suggests that insurance-related instruments can be a tool to help in adapting to and ameliorating the negative impacts of climate change for those countries likely to be most negatively affected by climate change. One possibility for an insurance-related mechanism would be a scheme that allows countries (or regions in large developing countries) most affected by climate change to purchase insurance-like coverage for defined climate-related risks. This article refers to such a scheme as the Climate Change Finance Mechanism (CCFM). The attempt to design and implement such an insurance-related mechanism requires careful consideration of several issues, including technical and political challenges. We outline a way to indemnify countries that are likely to suffer most from global climate change and consider what the key design elements would be. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptation finance; Climate change; Developing countries; Insurance; Post-2012 negotiations; Risk reduction; Scheme design","adaptation; climate change; developing world; disaster management; extreme event; financial system; insurance system; risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447576976

While producing water is necessary in order to desorb the methane from the coal itself, the damage from the drilling fluids used is difficult to assess because the gas production follows weeks to months after the well is drilled. Commonly asked questions include: What are the important parameters for drilling an organic reservoir rock that is both the source and the trap for the methane? Has the drilling fluid affected the gas production? Are the cleats plugged? Does the ""filtercake"" have an impact on the flow of water and gas? Are stimulation techniques compatible with the drilling fluids used? This paper describes the development of a unique drilling fluid to drill coalbed methane wells, with a special emphasis on horizontal applications. The fluid design incorporates products to match the delicate surface chemistry on the coal, a matting system to provide both borehole stability and minimize fluid losses to the cleats, and a BREAKER method of removing the matting system once drilling is completed. Field results from three horizontal wells will be discussed, two of which were drilled with the new drilling fluid system. The wells have demonstrated exceptional stability in coal for lengths to 1000 m, controlled drilling rates and ease of running slotted liners. Methods for, and results of, placing the BREAKER in the horizontal wells are covered in depth. Copyright 2006.

In order to develop a light management for jundiá fingerlings during indoor maintenance and to understand the relationship between welfare and light colour in the jundiá, fingerlings were exposed to white, blue and green light. At the 10th day of light exposure an acute stressor was imposed. One hour after the application of the stressor, fish were sampled. Stress was assessed by means of cortisol determination. Our results show that green light seems to be the worst alternative to illuminate jundiá indoor experimentation facilities, or even fish transportation. The results also suggests that colour affects the stress response of jundia, and may be usefull for the management of this species.","Cortisol; Light spectrum; Rhamdia; Silver catfish; Stressors","Heptapteridae; Rhamdia quelen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745839232

Wouldn't it be great if this technology could give you instant and measurable reductions of 5 percent or more in fuel consumption? Well, in the modern era, this technology has arrived. A small Romanian company has developed a technology that treats combustion air that significantly increases fuel efficiency and lowers emissions on furnaces and boilers by interacting with the fuel at the combustion stage. This technology has the potential to reduce emissions of CO2 by 2-20%, NOX by 530%, SOX by 20-60% and emissions that negatively affect human health like acid mists (SO3), dioxins, benzenes, and VOC by as much as 90%. With over a million hours of testing on over 100 boilers and furnaces this economical technology holds great promise. The best part of the technology is that there is limited capital investment or operational costs, and use of the specialty aerosol injection will reduce wear and corrosion in your combustion box regardless of the fuel burned. It reduces costs across the board. Avogadro Environmental Corporation in Easton, PA is working with our partners, Opris Engineering and Kubik in Romania to make this technology available in the United States. The technology has a long proven record of performance and has been fully tested in the U.S. for efficiency improvements and emissions reductions. The technology has received the support of USEPA and state agencies. We are looking for plant operators interested in reducing their emissions and at the same time saving 5 -25% in operating and maintenance costs.

These extremely low-emitting vehicles are 98% to 99% cleaner than the catalyst-equipped vehicles produced in the mid-1980s. To understand better the emissions characteristics of these extremely low-emitting vehicles, as well as their potential impact on future air quality, researchers at the University of California, Riverside, have conducted a comprehensive study consisting of (a) an emissions measurement program, (b) the development of specific emissions models, and (c) the application of future emissions inventories to air quality models. Results have shown that in nearly all cases, these vehicles have emissions that are well below their stringent certification standards, and the vehicles continue to have low emissions as they age. On the basis of the measurement results, new modal emissions models have been created for both ultra-low-emission-certified vehicles and partial-zero-emission-certified vehicles. The model results compare well with actual measurements. With these models, it is possible to predict accurately future mobile source emissions inventories that will have an increasing number of these extremely low-emitting vehicles in the overall vehicle population. It is expected that the large penetration of these vehicles into the vehicle fleet will have a significant role in meeting ozone attainment levels in many regions.",,"Air quality; Gasoline; Ozone; Standards; Emissions measurement program; Ozone attainment; Ultra-low-emission-certified vehicles; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947578984

These pollutants often have detrimental effects, directly or indirectly, on human health and natural resources. Electricity generation is considered to be one of the main contributing sources to the air pollution problem. It is therefore important to develop and implement effective control strategies to prevent the expected abrupt increase in emissions from this sector. Any control strategy must be suitable for local implementation and must also be economically viable. The main objective of this paper is to present optimization models that can be used to determine the most cost effective strategy or combination of strategies to reduce CO2 emissions to a specific level. Optimization results for an existing network of power plants show that it may be possible to reduce CO2 emissions by increasing power plant efficiency through a variety of adjustments in the plants. These include fuel balancing, fuel switching, and the implementation of improvement technologies to existing power plants to increase their thermal efficiency.",,"Air pollutants; CO2 emissions; Control strategies; Cost effective strategies; Detrimental effects; Electricity generation; Fuel switching; Human health; Industrial development; Optimization models; Power plant efficiency; Thermal efficiency; Air quality; Atmospheric radiation; Cost reduction; Electric generators; Electric power generation; Industrial emissions; Optimization; Pollution; Power plants; Precipitation (meteorology); Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75149142914

Dependent almost exclusively on gasoline, this trend will further increase greenhouse gas emissions, as well as local pollution, unless alternative fuels and technologies are introduced. The promotion of CNG vehicles seems to be the quickest mitigation option and is already been accounted for. This is in addition to the previously adopted policy of substituting natural gas for fuel oil in the power sector and in industry to comply with environmental regulations. Alternative scenarios to 2030 were developed using the LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning) system of the Stockholm Environment Institute, Boston. Scenarios where diesel vehicles and a combination of hybrid and diesel vehicles are promoted were compared. This expectation was not fulfilled because of the larger energy intensity of CNG vehicles compared to gasoline, diesel and hybrid vehicles. This promoted an increase in energy demand that offsets an expected reduction in GHG emissions. The intensified use of natural gas increased the supply deficit leading to the need of larger imports than those arising from the policy of substitution of natural gas for fuel oil in the power sector. From the road transport point of view, diesel and hybrid vehicles are a better alternative.

These vehicles are the exclusive mode of delivery in over 75 percent of U.S. communities. Such utilization and dependency demand commercial vehicles be reliable, durable, and cost effective. The heart of these commercial vehicles (Classes 3-8) is the diesel engine. The widespread use of the diesel engine can be attributed to its reliability, durability, and cost effectiveness. However, the 2007 and 2010 EPA emissions regulations are creating significant challenges for diesel-powered commercial vehicles. Engine and vehicle manufacturers must strike a balance between emissions, performance, and affordability. A consequence of the evolution of the diesel engine to meet the increasingly stringent emissions regulations is that more effort to accommodate the associated changes is driven to the vehicle manufacturers. However, a result of this engine evolution is that commercial vehicles are now more environmentally-friendly as part of the vehicle evolution to become safer, more productive, ergonomic, and driver-friendly. The diesel engine touches many of the vehicle's systems, sub-systems, and components, all of which have to be analyzed for direct and indirect influence from associated engine changes. When these changes include new technologies at the vehicle level, as is the case for 2007 with active exhaust aftertreatment, implementation for the vehicle manufacturer becomes even greater. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive exposure to the numerous tasks and challenges associated with changes to diesel engines and related vehicle systems imposed by regulatory mandates. An historical perspective on the levels of effort associated with previous emissions regulations is offered to emphasize the level of effort required to support the 2007 Diesel Engine Emissions Regulations. Attaining the overall goal of implementing the 2007 changes in production requires a systematic engineering approach from assessing customer requirements to delivering products that meet these requirements. Elements of program management, product management, timing, overlapping programs, new considerations in trade-off decisions, higher levels of integration, higher levels of analysis, higher levels of verification, and collaboration of extended resource teams are examined as well as an exploration of potential implications for future emissions reduction technologies.

Successful implementation of the measurement technique introduced in this paper can be used to evaluate injectors and improve their designs. More consistent and precise fuel injectors have the potential to improve fuel efficiency, engine performance, and reduce emissions. The experiments for this study were conducted at the Michigan State University Automotive Research Experiment Station. The setup consists of a fuel supply vessel pressurized by compressed nitrogen, a Dantec laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) system to measure the centerline velocity of fuel, a quartz tube for optical access, and a Cosworth IC 5460 to control the injector. The detector on the LDA system is capable of resolving Doppler bursts as short as 6μs, depending on the level of seeding, thus giving a detailed time/velocity profile. From this profile, the mass injected for each injection event is then calculated using appropriate fluid mechanics equations for unsteady flows. These calculated values were compared with cycle-averaged measurements to validate the accuracy of this technique. Finally, profiles of the mass injected per cycle were generated and the variability calculated in terms of standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and probability density functions (PDFs).

A dispersion relation of the plasma perturbations in the case of a perfectly conducting ionosphere is obtained. Analyzing starting conditions of a flute instability in the disk, the ""threshold"" radial profile of the plasma density is determined. An application of the results obtained to the known data on the Jovian plasma disk is discussed.",,"aurora; electromagnetic field; ionosphere; Jupiter; magnetosphere; planetary atmosphere; plasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751117491

The 681 km offshore pipeline will carry eventually 450 million cu ft/day of gas to Benin, Togo, and Ghana contributing to their stable and secure supply of affordable natural gas and helping their power sector, deal more effectively with drought-ridden, unreliable hydro power or expensive solid or liquid fueled thermal power. The main sponsors of the project are private oil companies, lead by ChevronTexaco. The WAGP will also promote reforms including a modern institutional and regulatory framework for gas that will spread to the Energy Sector as a whole, thus facilitating private sector participation. The two systems would help create regional energy trade and cross-border exchanges between National Utilities and be the first major building block between the ECOWAS countries, and a major leap in improving access to clean energy under the NEPAD short term Action-Plan. It will also effectively contribute to the Nigeria 2008-Zero-Gas Flaring Policy, thus reducing greenhouse gas emission in Nigeria by 25% and enabling the four countries to reap additional benefits though enhanced fiscal revenues.

Against a background of tightened environmental limits on operation of large combustion plant, ageing of the existing nuclear stations and uncertainty regarding gas supplies, there are concerns as to whether the characteristics of wind farms lend themselves to providing adequate generation security. There are also concerns over the extent of the network reinforcements necessary to permit exports of power from wind farms. Finally, there is the risk that, without adequate and timely network investment, import capability and the normally available reserves of power will often be insufficient for demand within a region to be served. This paper discusses some of the main issues in respect of both medium to long-term generation security and, in particular, the capability of a transmission system to serve demand. The British context for these issues is discussed in detail where, on the one hand, it has been left to the market to determine the total provision of generation capacity and its location, and, on the other, the transmission licensees have been under an obligation to invest in additional network capacity in accordance, in the first instance, with a reliability based inter-area power transfer rule. It is questionable whether former paradigms for identification of necessary network reinforcements will be adequate in a system with a significant amount of wind generation. A number of the issues associated with revision of underlying paradigms are discussed. Given what is stake - the costs of major transmission upgrades, the efficiency of the electricity market, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the risks to electricity supply - and with the need for accountability to all stakeholders, it is concluded that it will be imperative that need for investment in additional transmission capacity is clearly identified so that it can be carried out in a timely manner. In Britain, a new transmission investment planning rule is likely to be required, and this will need to be based upon rigorous analysis.","Power system operation; Power system security; Renewables; Transmission system investment planning; Wind generation","Investment planning; Power system operations; Power system security; Renewables; Wind generation; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Gas supply; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Reinforcement; Wind power; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876775867

Lightweight components will improve ease of use, performance and structure of many applications, especially where mobility is essential. In transportation (bicycle, vehicle, spacecraft etc.) applications - for example, the steel in a chassis is strong and relatively cheap but is also very heavy. A reduction in vehicle weight will reduce fuel consumption and emission without degrading performance. Magnesium is an attractive material, primarily because of its light weight (Mg density ∼ 1.7 g/cm3) - it is 36% lighter per unit volume than Aluminum and 78% lighter than Iron. When alloyed, it has the highest strength-to-weight ratio of all the structural metals, about 65% of that of Aluminium. Furthermore, Mg is the eighth most abundant element; seawater, the main source of supply, contains 0.13% Mg, which represents a virtually unlimited supply. The objective of this research was to develop a method for the manufacturing of lightweight components from magnesium alloys, for all stages of manufacturing up to the semi-finished part, where the rest of the finishing can be done in conventional methods. Internal High Pressure forming (IHPF) is a well-known technique for the production of structure parts in the automotive industry. Especially in the body structure, weight saving is an important design issue, which can be realized by load optimized design and the use of lightweight materials, such as aluminum and magnesium. However, magnesium has a hexagonal lattice structure and shows a low formability at room temperature, as well as different tensile- and compression properties. Beside the strength properties, the formability of the extrusions plays a key role for potential applications. First investigations on hot extruded magnesium tubes show that a maximum hoop strain of 20% can be realized under plane strain condition, if the forming temperature is increased to 350°C. However, the tube does not expand uniformly, which leads to a non-uniform wall thickness reduction of the IHPF part. The reasons for the non-uniform expansion might be found in the hot extrusion technique as well as in differences of the grain size of hot extruded tubes. It was found that indirect hot extrusion or direct hot extrusion with moving or fixed mandrel, at a certain extrusion parameters, results in secondary forming suitable tubes. Some complex magnesium technological demonstrators were formed by Internal High Pressure forming, using hot indirect extruded Mg-tubes. These tubes showed a good formability in radial direction, as well as high strength properties, which are required for structure parts. The research was conducted in a collaboration of Rotem Industry (Israel), IFU - Stuttgart University, Institute for Metal Forming Technology (Germany), Technical University of Berlin, Ohio State University (Columbus, Ohio USA) as a joined venture lead by Magtech-Magnesium Technologies Ltd.","Bulging; Extrusion; Hydroforming; IHPF; Magnesium; Tube","Aluminum alloys; Extrusion; Fuel consumption; Lattice constants; Polymers; Steel; Tubes (components); Bulging; Hydroforming; IHPF; Tube; Magnesium alloys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646135996

Furthermore, acid-gas injection operations constitute a commercial-scale commercial analogue to CO2 injection in geological media as a climate change mitigation measure. Deep saline aquifers provide a very large capacity for the sequestration of acid and greenhouse gases, being ubiquitous in all sedimentary basins around the world. Proper understanding of the relative permeability character of such systems is essential in ascertaining gas injectivity and migration, and in assessing the suitability, containment and safety of prospective injection sites. Pure CO 2 and H2S represent the compositional end-members of acid and greenhouse gases, thus the interest in measuring their displacement properties. This paper presents the detailed experimental equipment and protocols, and the results of a series of relative permeability tests conducted at full reservoir conditions using supercritical pure CO2 and H 2S on samples of intercrystaline sandstone and carbonate rocks from the Wabamun Lake area in central Alberta, Canada, where large CO2 sources and several acid-gas injection operations exist. Results for both drainage and imbibition relative permeability experiments are presented for each fluid and rock type, as well as measurements of the interfacial tension (IFT) between brines and CO2 and H2S at in situ conditions, and correlations of these results with the IFT, measured rock capillary pressure, pore size distribution and mineralogical data. The results allow a comparison between the drainage and imbibition relative permeability character and performance of the two gases, and provide a valuable dataset for the evaluation and simulation of acid gas disposal and CO2 storage projects.

Three test conditions were investigated: 1) base case without additional electrical and electronic shredder residue, 2) addition of 11 weight percent ESR containing E&amp;E plastics, 3) addition of 26 weight percent ESR with E&amp;E plastics. The fact that some electrical and electronic equipment is already in the mixed MSW feed to many waste-to-energy plants made the testing important for the MHKW operator as well as for the local regulatory authorities (EPA). The tests investigated the effect of ESR on plant operations, air emissions (acids, organic, and metals), and ash characteristics, and on the destruction efficiencies for several chlorinated and brominated substances present in the ESR. The large scale test used 103 tons of ESR derived from 650 tons of a typical mix of information technology equipment, consumer electronics, small household appliances, and other products. The ESR was supplied by Electrocycling in Germany. The tests were successfully completed from an operational standpoint without long time delays and did not show any mechanical blockage during the test in spite of the high heating value, 23 GJ/t, of the ESR. The grate was operated at close to 90 percent throughput. Clean gas concentrations of chlorinated dioxins/furans were all well below the 0.1 ng ITE /m 3 regulatory limit.

However, this may not be the case since reductions of greenhouse gases generally will lead to changes in emissions of short-lived gases and aerosols. Abatement measures may be primarily targeted at reducing CO2, but may also simultaneously reduce emissions of NOx, CO, CH4 and SO2 and aerosols. Emissions of these species may cause significant additional radiative forcing. We have used a global 3-D chemical transport model and a radiative transfer model to study the impact on climate in terms of radiative forcing for a realistic change in location of the emissions from large-scale sources. Based on an assumed 10% reduction in CO2 emissions, reductions in the emissions of other species have been estimated. Climate impact for the SRES A1B scenario is compared to two reduction cases, with the main focus on a case with emission reductions between 2010 and 2030, but also a case with sustained emission reductions. The emission reductions are applied to four different regions (Europe, China, South Asia, and South America). In terms of integrated radiative forcing (over 100 yr), the total effect (including only the direct effect of aerosols) is always smaller than for CO2 alone. Large variations between the regions are found (53-86% of the CO2 effect). Inclusion of the indirect effects of sulphate aerosols reduces the net effect of measures towards zero. The global temperature responses, calculated with a simple energy balance model, show an initial additional warming of different magnitude between the regions followed by a more uniform reduction in the warming later. A major part of the regional differences can be attributed to differences related to aerosols, while ozone and changes in methane lifetime make relatively small contributions. Emission reductions in a different sector (e.g. transportation instead of large-scale sources) might change this conclusion since the NOx to SO2 ratio in the emissions is significantly higher for transportation than for large-scale sources. The total climate effect of abatement measures thus depends on (i) which gases and aerosols are affected by the measure, (ii) the lifetime of the measure implemented, (iii) time horizon over which the effects are considered, and (iv) the chemical, physical and meteorological conditions in the region. There are important policy implications of the results. Equal effects of a measure cannot be assumed if the measure is implemented in a different region and if several gases are affected. Thus, the design of emission reduction measures should be considered thoroughly before implementation. © Springer 2006.",,"Aerosols; Biodiversity; Climate change; Gas emissions; Meteorology; Ozone; Public policy; 3-D chemical transport; Abatement measures; Climate policy; Emissions reductions; Greenhouse effect; aerosol; carbon dioxide; emission control; environmental impact assessment; environmental legislation; global warming; greenhouse gas; radiative transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744965430

The basic idea is to determine the hazard zones by simulating the lava flows originated from a number of sample points localized in regions at high density of vents, called eruption zones. The key choice is the adoption of a probabilistic model for the simulation of the lava flow. In the paper we outline the characteristics of the model, called ELFM, and how it has been validated. On the other side, for the determination of the eruption zones, which likely contain the points of future lava flows emissions, we propose an approach based on data mining techniques.","Geological map; GIS; Lava flow invasion assessment; Probabilistic lava flow simulation model; Volcanic hazard map","Active volcanoes; Data mining techniques; Geological data; Geological map; Hazard map; Hazard zones; High density; Lava flows; Mount Etna; Number of samples; Probabilistic models; Volcanic hazards; Computer simulation; Geographic information systems; Hazards",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858637844

The shifting of cargo to other traffic routes is the result of the improvements made in port services, in the colleration and cooperation between ports and with the further development of inland waterways should help to reduce the road transport on the congested European transport network. Short sea shipping represents a very good alternative to road transport and it is an environmentally accepted service as it gives a contribution to the decongestion of the European motorways and to the reduction of air pollution and energy consumption. The creation of a sea motorway network is an excellent support to the short sea shipping. The implementation of sea motorways in the European Union might provide new opportunities for the regional development and for the development of the East Mediterranean countries. Slovenia and Croatia included, should take advantage of this concept. The European sea motorway network is still on a planning level, but the target of the European Commission is to have a complete network of sea motorways spread around Europe by the end of the year 2010. The infrastructure and equipment that support an efficient, rapid and low cost cargo shifting procedures in the East Mediterranean is a poor one. Therefore, major investments have to be made for the introduction of sea motorways. Leading an active transport policy all countries in the region, including Slovenia and Croatia, shoud benefit from the the introduction of this well-developed concept of sea motorways and short sea shipping.","Inland waterways transport; Ports; Sea motorways; Short sea shipping","cargo; maritime transportation; motorway; port operation; shipping; traffic congestion; traffic management; transportation policy; Eurasia; Europe; European Union; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (East); Slovenia; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745950826

While the EU-15 Member States (MS) intend to reduce emissions by about 8–11%, the implied excess allocation in the new Member States lies between 17% and 31%. Compared with a cost-efficient split of the required emission reductions, the ET budgets in the EU-15 MS are generally too large. Thus, in total, the burden for the non-trading sectors (households, tertiary and transport) is too high. Furthermore, the high shares of governments' intended and companies' possible use of Kyoto mechanisms challenge the supplementarity principle. Our detailed analyses of the allocation methods of these NAPs (across countries and phases) suggest that MS should adhere to the concepts and methodologies developed in phase I. This implies that only a little progress has been made towards achieving more efficient and more harmonized allocation rules across MS.

Ion beam energy correlations for operation in methane indicate that the dominant charge states on the detector are H+, C+4 and C+5. The correlation of ion beam intensity with filling gas pressure indicates that the beam emission maximizes at the optimum pressure for focus formation at peak current.

On a global basis, indoor air quality is one of the top three environmental issues facing all countries and all people. Toxic chemicals, inorganic gases, particles, and microbes that are released by products into the indoor environment can contribute to human irritation, discomfort, and long term health consequences to those exposed. These human effects can lead to excessive medical costs, significant loss of productivity, and undesirable litigation. Printing devices are known contributors of indoor pollution such as respirable particles, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as styrene and formaldehyde, and ozone. Sources of these include construction materials, electronic and heating processes, inks and toners, papers and transparencies, plastics, and cleaning solvents. Manufacturers of office equipment are proactively designing for the environment, including indoor air quality as an important part of their product stewardship. Eco-criteria have been established for acceptable levels of airborne contaminants released by operating equipment. This paper will review current international programs addressing allowable emissions from print devices (including Blue Angel, Greenguard, and the State of California), test procedures, and representative emissions data from printers, copier, and computers. Eco-criteria are based on the performance of operating office equipment and acceptable contributions of certain pollutants. Acceptable pollutant emissions of respirable particles, formaldehyde, styrene, benzene, and total volatile organic compounds are based on existing health and safety data with some consideration for protecting sensitive people from irritants and odorants. The primary measurement technique, environmental chamber technology, has been validated to test products under realistic use conditions and to determine emission rates of pollutant release. These data can be used in exposure models to predict and estimate potential human exposures, and to compare product data with prescribed eco-criteria. This measurement technology has been accepted on a global basis and ISO documentation is being prepared as a joint US/European effort. © 2006 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",,"Indoor air pollution; Pollution; Printing machinery; Solvents; Volatile organic compounds; Indoor environmental quality; Inorganic gases; Public facilities; Printing; Pollution; Printing Machines; Toners",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947252253

Although the average energy of the transmitted electrons drops a little, the thermoelectric figure of merit can be increased with a nonplanar barrier structure.

The Center's state-of-the-art laboratory facility and commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Software were used in the development of this technology. Following laboratory development and testing, this technology was successfully installed at four U.S. power plants with following characteristics: Stations A and B: 85 MW front-wall fired, two-way splitter junctions Station C: 190 MW front-wall fired, three-way splitter junctions Station D: 250 MW front-wall fired, three-way splitter junctions This paper focuses on the performance of the on-line coal flow controller at Station D, which has a unit equipped with two D-10D double-ended Foster Wheeler (FW) ball tube pulverizers. Pulverized coal from each mill end is supplied to one bumer row with three burners by an adjustable three-way distributor. The primary objective of this project was to improve plant performance and operating conditions, and reduce CO and NOx emissions through eliminating severe coal flow imbalances (as high as 50 percent) between burner lines. The coal flow control technology successfully reduced pipe-to-pipe coal flow imbalances from the +/- 50.0 percent to below the +/- 6.0 percent range without affecting the primary air flow distribution among the coal pipes. Test results showed improvements in unit performance, emissions and operations as a consequence of more uniform coal flow distribution between burners. Some of the improvements in plant performance include reduction in fly ash LOI level (from 24.90 to 20.34 percent), CO emissions (from 86.2 to 76.70 ppm), ammonia injection rate (from 106.84 to 88.04 gpm), and furnace excess O 2 level (from 3.68 to 3.09 percent). Based on reductions in fly ash LOI level from 24.90 to 20.34 percent, the financial benefit of coal flow balancing is estimated to be approximately $414,124 per year. Other financial benefits such as reduction in ammonia injection rate, additional unit generation capacity due to better CO emissions, increased SCR catalyst lifetime, fewer air pre-heater washes, and less coal pipe and burner maintenance expenses were not included in these calculations because longer term data are needed to quantify the financial aspects of these benefits.",,"Coal flow distribution; Injection rate; Plant performance; Splitter junction; Coal fired boilers; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer software; Flow control; Online systems; Steam piping systems; Electric power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750338705

Native Populus forests have declined, while the exotic Eurasian shrub, Tamarix, has proliferated and now dominates most floodplain ecosystems. Photographs from late 19th and early 20th centuries illustrate wide river channels with largely bare in-channel landforms and shrubby higher channel margin floodplains. However, by the mid-20th century, floodplains supporting dense Tamarix stands had expanded, and river channels had narrowed. Along the lower Green River in eastern Utah, the causal mechanism of channel and floodplain changes remains ambiguous due to the confounding effects of climatically driven reductions in flood magnitude, river regulation by Flaming Gorge Dam, and Tamarix invasion. This study addressed whether Tamarix establishment and spread followed climate- or dam-induced reductions in annual peak flows or whether Tamarix was potentially a driver of floodplain changes. We aged 235 Tamarix and 57 Populus individuals, determined the hydrologic and geomorphic processes that controlled recruitment, identified the spatial relationships of germination sites within floodplain stratigraphic transects, and mapped woody riparian vegetation cohorts along three segments of the lower Green River. The oldest Tamarix established along several sampling reaches in 1938, and 1.50-2.25 m of alluvium has accreted above their germination surfaces. Nearly 90% of the Tamarix and Populus samples established during flood years that exceeded the 2.5-year recurrence interval. Recruitment was most common when large floods were followed by years with smaller peak flows. The majority of Tamarix establishment and Green River channel narrowing occurred long before river regulation by Flaming Gorge Dam. Tamarix initially colonized bare instream sand deposits (e.g., islands and bars), and most channel and floodplain changes followed the establishment of Tamarix. Our results suggest that Tamarix recruitment was triggered by large annual floods that were followed by years with lower peak flows, not by periods of low flow alone.

In this work PLA fabrics containing variable concentrations of the d- and l-isomers have been studied to ascertain their dyeability, the characteristics of those dyed polymers, and their subsequent performance and properties. Comparison of poly(lactic acid) fabrics with varying d-isomer content revealed differences in melting temperature; by virtue of a higher d-isomer concentration, 'high d-' fibres have greater fibre entropy which causes a decrease in melting temperature. As a result of greater fibre entropy, high d- fibres have more amorphous and less crystalline regions in the polymer, with respect to low d- fibres, hence, high d- fabrics display greater dye exhaustion and colour strength in comparison with their low d- counterpart in all dyes and all concentrations. In application of a dye mixture for a black shade, high d- fibres are able to be dyed to an excellent black shade, whereas low d- fibres appear very brown, due to lower exhaustion of the blue component of the mix. In terms of wash fastness, there is very little difference between high d- fibres and low d- fibres; this is because the glass transition temperature for both fibres is very similar. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Some problems in developing practical laser-based detectors are also discussed. Analysis presented gives information on the expected levels of vapours concentration in the atmosphere for the most common explosives and suggests possible scenario of their detection. Comparison is made in the presentation of the main optical effects regarding the efficiency of interaction between the matter and radiation and potentialities of the laser-based detection methods are being assessed. A possibility is analyzed of using for this purpose the fluorescence and resonance Raman scattering at excitation in deep UV region. To improve the selectivity of the detection it is proposed to make use of the spectroscopic approach based on the method of time-resolved excitation-emission matrices. This approach is capable of improving the detection selectivity by use of four-dimensional spectroscopic images of the objects surveyed. The way of realizing a detection system based on this approach is proposed that assumes development of a multichannel spectrum analyzer possessing high time resolution. As an example some preliminary results are presented on detecting minor molecular species in the atmosphere with a 32-spectral channel lidar.

Storage of electrical energy is the most critical aspect of hybrid automobiles. Therefore, an exact knowledge of the behavior of the battery and further electrical storage elements is mandatory. Their nonlinear characteristics over wide ranges of current magnitude, transient period, temperature and state of charge must be evaluated. Battery aging is another matter of increasing importance. For this reason, an automated battery test bench has been developed which is capable of reproducing high dynamic loads in both charging and discharging direction. Pulse rise times are in the range of a few microseconds at maximum currents up to 1500 A. The quasi-static charge and discharge power can reach 20 kW. Optimized characterization programs enable a rapid extraction of battery behavior parameters as well as capacitor characteristics. With this equipment various types of automotive batteries such as lead-acid and nickel-metal hydride batteries and all types of double-layer capacitors can be characterized. For statistical analysis of several batteries in parallel, a compact version of the test bench with reduced current amplitudes and transient response times was developed. This stand-alone tester can be used for both stimulating aging effects and characterizing the most relevant battery parameters simultaneously. The battery measurement equipment was successfully used to characterize different types of batteries. Parameterization of a battery model with high transient and amplitude dynamics for automotive applications was reached. This paper will show the complex analog and power electronics as well as the flexible data acquisition and load profile generation. Furthermore, measured data and model responses will be presented together with aging effects of double-layer capacitors.

In the early 1990's the Pennsylvania Bituminous Mine Safety Association Committee developed a plan to bring the interested parties together to discuss the use of diesels in Pennsylvania. Talks were held between the Pennsylvania Coal Association PCA, the UMWA and equipment manufacturers. These discussions led to the involvement of various organizations such as NIOSH, Perm State and other lesser know groups. As a result of these talks, a law was crafted for the controlled use of diesel-powered equipment in Pennsylvania coalmines. This law was passed in 1996 as an amendment to the Bituminous Coal Mine Act. The Draft Federal Law was used as a guideline for the initial Pa law and in fact, the Pa law references the MSHA law in a number of areas. The Pa law was passed by the legislatures with an enactment date in the future. Meanwhile, the draft federal law was modified resulting in the requirement of changes to the final approved law. The changes were developed through the Pa Technical Advisory Committee for immediate implementation. The Pa diesel program regulates emission standards and utilizes carbon monoxide changes to monitor DPM emissions. Maintenance and training programs are the backbone of the regulation. Article II established a technical advisory committee to evaluate issues in the interpretation and implementation of the act. The current Pa diesel fleet has not been without problems but the TAC has worked with industry and labor to craft standards that are acceptable to all parties.

The results from lab-scale experimentation of MSW thermal treatment by using High Temperature Air Combustion (HTAC) technique were shown the saving of energy consumption and reduction of emission of toxic pollutants, especially NOx. Consequently, the 12 Tons Per Day (TPD) MSW combustor was built to assess its performance. The system consists of an automatic feeding machine to feed the waste into the primary combustion chamber (PCC) where the combustion takes place. The push ram is used to push the burning waste and fall down to the lower hearth. Primary combustion air is supplied into PCC at the amount lower than the stoichiometric requirement to produce the combustible gas which is flown into the Secondary Combustion Chamber (SCC) located above PCC. Secondary combustion air is injected to react with combustible gas to convert to the product of complete combustion.

Facts are that people spend more that 80 percent of their time indoors. Measurements have shown that levels of some indoor air contaminants can be many times higher than those outdoors. Known sources and factors for poor indoor air quality include tobacco smoke, radon, microbial contamination, dust, pet dander, fibers and particulates. But they seem to be secondary to public concern for chemical emissions from products. Concerns of health effects from certain chemical air pollutants at even very low concentrations (parts per billion or ""ppb"") in the workplace and the home have driven suppliers to test their products for emissions in order to assess the impact of those products on indoor air quality. Technology and methods to evaluate the indoor air performance of products have advanced over the past decade. State, federal and green building rating guidelines with health-based exposure limits have evolved both domestically and globally. At the same time, the use of vinyl as a replacement for traditional materials and products in the building and construction sector continues to grow. New uses such as vinyl decking and rail, vinyl moldings and trims, along with new flooring and wall covering designs, have increased the use of vinyl in both exterior and interiors of buildings. Product manufacturers' attention to impacts of products on indoor air quality has resulted in development of new innovative vinyl compounds and new installation methods. Taken together, these improvements allow vinyl products to meet and exceed even the evolving target for product performance from an indoor air quality perspective. Many of these products require less maintenance and cleaning, resulting in lowering of indoor pollutants.

Fossil-fuel fired electricity generation contributes to these emissions, and most western governments now recognise that their reduction offers the best hope of meeting international emission targets. Inevitably this will lead to closure of generating plant leaving a capacity shortfall unless alternative energy sources are developed. Renewables are commonly proposed as a partial solution, being both environmentally neutral and free from the safety concerns relating associated with nuclear energy. Electrical and thermal generation using biomass represents a positive environmental choice that can in most cases be considered effectively carbon neutral. This technology is mature, and does not suffer from problems of intermittency that characterise other renewables. However, considerable challenges remain for its successful development in the United Kingdom (UK). These exist in three principal domains; fuel supply, markets and market incentivisation, and regulation. These issues have already been overcome in the Nordic states, and it is not unreasonable that biomass could at least partially address the projected capacity gap in the UK.

The present article aims at cross-comparing emission paths derived by plausible short-term policies against those implied by long-term climate targets, comparing, for example, differences in peak periods. Short-term policies considered are, for instance, Kyoto-type targets with or without participation by the USA and/or by developing countries. Long-term targets focus instead on stabilization of CO2 concentrations, radiative forcing and the increase in atmospheric temperature relative to pre-industrial levels. In order to account for the uncertainty surrounding the climate cycle, for each long-term goal multiple paths of emission—the most probable, the optimistic and the pessimistic projections—are considered in the comparison exercise. Comparative analysis is performed using the FEEM-RICE model, a regional economy—climate model. The results suggest that some early policy action should take place for short-term emissions to be compatible with long-term targets. In particular, the Kyoto-type regimes appear to be on a compatible emission path, at least up to the second commitment period.

These caves are atypical in terms of origin, chemistry, and ecosystem properties. They prominently display sulfur minerals, characteristic cavity topologies, and notable biological diversity and biological productivity resulting directly from the conditions that produce the caves. Even long-inactive systems still harbor some of these indicators. The microbial and macroscopic ecosystems within sulfuric-acid speleogenetic caves are geologically mediated and maintained. This geological mediation is a theme connecting them with other sulfur-driven ecosystems on Earth, including deep-sea hydrothermal vents, sulfurous near-surface hydrothermal systems, and solfataras. Evidence exists for potentially significant microbial participation in the process of speleogenesis itself. Recent results confirming the high relative abundance of sulfur on Mars, an apparent sedimentary basin with high sulfate concentration, near-surface indicators of ice and water, and trace detection of reduced gases (especially methane) in the Martian atmosphere, possibly deriving from subsurface microbial sources, set the stage for suggesting that sulfuric-acid speleogenetic systems may be useful as astrobiological analogs for hypothetical Mars ecosystems. Unique speleogenetic mechanisms may occur on Mars and could provide subsurface void space suitable for habitationby such hypothetical microbial systems. © 2006 Geological Society of America.","Acid speleogenesis; Astrobiology; Extraterrestrial caves; Mars; Microorganisms; Sulfur","Astrobiology; Caves; Hot springs; Microorganisms; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Sulfuric acid; Trace analysis; Biological community; Biological productivity; Deep-sea hydrothermal vents; Hydrothermal system; Mars; Martian atmospheres; Microbial communities; Sulfate concentrations; Ecosystems; biological production; extraterrestrial matter; hydrothermal system; hydrothermal vent; Mars; microbial community; planetary landform; species diversity; speleology; sulfur; sulfuric acid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73949100786

If the propulsive performance have to be computed, optimised and if possible demonstrated, a major challenge is the capacity to build such an engine, and to estimate its robustness and its weight. System studies, technologies demonstration and computational techniques have been under concern at MBDA France from conventional ramjets to hypersonic engines. Aerodynamical, chemical, mechanical and thermal investigations of composite and metallic structures have been carried out, using both analytical tools and 3-D numerical simulations. Engineering tools for active cooling, based on experimental results, have already been presented in the last AIAA Hypersonic conferences in Kyoto, Orleans and Capua. Besides this state of the art, CFD analysis has been increasingly being used, bringing more detailed information. The Orleans 2001 paper evoked near-term possibilities and future works to enhance the efficiency of thermal analysis of hypersonic ramjet structures. The present paper will show significant achievements in this field. Step by step, news aspects have been taken into account such as transient behaviour, 3D hydraulics, material anisotropy, decomposition of the cooling fuel, flow through the hot porous wall, and two-phase flow (for bubbled kerosene). These modelling efforts are necessary to compute more and more complex structures, ideally up to the whole actively cooled combustor. Thus, particular emphasis has been done on the time reduction methods for use of 3D coupled computations , in a advanced study of a complete actual cooled engine structure. Results to be presented are including comparison between 1-D computations, 3-D computations and experimental results. This includes actively cooled panels with pin fins and inert gas, 2D constant channel with water or hydrocarbon , simple test cases , existing experimental tubes with heated hydrocarbon, complete duct with simple 3D thermal-hydraulic effects,... The current numerical approache is based mainly on the NANCY in-house semi empirical code and on the commercial CFD-ACE 3D fluid mechanics code. Effect of the physical modelling (for example turbulence or boundary layer model) is also investigated, sometimes in comparison with other numerical approaches and other CFD tools which incorporate the same physical models with other numerical aspects. This analysis is mainly devoted on the coupling between thermal (conductive, convective, transpirative, radiative) and hydraulic phenomena. External link with FEM mechanical tool is, up to now, preferred for the associated mechanical analysis of the cooled structure. Application of the 3D coupled methododology to other cooled systems is also possible, in cooperation with other end-users.",,"Dual-mode ramjets; Hypersonic engines; Reusable Space Launchers; Computation theory; Computational fluid dynamics; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Hydrocarbons; Launching; Two phase flow; Ramjet engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947225124

To develop efficient emission control strategies and demonstrate future attainment with the NAAQS, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GA EPD) used the MM5/SMOKE/CMAQ modeling system to perform episodic emission sensitivities. Regional sensitivities evaluated the response of ozone and PM2.5 to emission reductions of NOx, VOC, SO2, NH3, and primary organic and elemental carbon (PC) in Atlanta. Seasonal average PM2.5 sensitivities were calculated for the summer and winter episodes. For PM2.5 controls, the largest benefits were achieved from additional controls of regional PC from Atlanta. The benefits in the winter were almost double those of the summer due to higher PC emissions and lower mixing heights in the winter. Controls of regional SO2, NOx, NH3, and VOC have a much smaller benefit. The benefits of adding scrubbers were much more pronounced in the summertime when warmer temperatures foster photochemical formation of secondary sulfate. Unfortunately, the implementation of scrubbers and a realistic regional reduction in PC emissions across Atlanta likely will not be sufficient to bring Fire Station #8 into attainment. This was primarily due to the impact of significant local sources such as a large railyard and a couple of cement/asphalt recycling facilities in the immediate vicinity that need to be addressed.

A five-well pilot project was implemented in early 2005 to demonstrate the ability of intelligent well down-hole flow control valves to restrict or isolate the production of CO 2 from breakthrough zones in production wells and to control the distribution of CO2 injection in injection wells. The objective is to reduce unnecessary cycling of CO2 between injectors and producers, improve sweep efficiency, increase oil production and improve ultimate oil reserve recovery. This is done with cost effective, fit-for-purpose intelligent well systems. The intelligent well technologies and work processes described in this paper are applicable to all EOR/IOR field development plans, and in particular to CO2 WAG developments. The intelligent well technologies as used in this example are applicable to layered, compartmentalized and complex reservoirs, in particular for patterned secondary and tertiary flood processes. Initial results show the CO2 production can be significantly reduced while maintaining economic oil production.

The first was a 630 MWg rear-wall faced fired boiler with 30 burners equipped with an existing non-effective over-fire air (OFA) system and FGR. The second was a 125 MWg T-fired boiler with 16 burners capable of firing No. 6 fuel oil only. Objective The project goal was to achieve an excess of the guaranteed NOx reduction in a simple and cost-effective manner. Several technologies were proposed including SNCR, Reburn, OFA, and Burner Modifications. A combined OFA and Low NOx burner modification approach was selected based upon cost and guaranteed NOx reductions. The advantages of this technology approach are primarily the simplicity of its process and low capital-cost. Final Results For the 603 MWg boiler, baseline NOx emissions were 0.276 lbs./mmBtu, based upon the units load schedule. The NOx reduction technologies employed, achieve a reduction of 0.167 lbm/MMBtu, below the guaranteed level of 0.185 lbm/MMBtu. The overall NOx emission reduction was 40.8%. The lifecycle cost for this technology modification was less than $700/ton of NOx removed (based on a 5 year recovery period). NOx emissions for the 125 MW T-Fired unit was reduced from a baseline emission level of 0.240 lbm/MMBtu to 0.157 lbm/MMBtu that was below the guaranteed level of 0.173 lbm/MMBtu. The overall NOx emission reduction was 34.6%. The lifecycle cost for this technology modification was approximately $1,402/ton of NOx removed.

The Water module of the MKM is a tool to select the most cost-efficient emission reduction measures to obtain a given surface water quality. The optimization model determines by means of standard linear programming techniques the least-cost combination of abatement measures to satisfy multi-pollutant emission reduction targets. The basic model input is an extensive database of (point and diffuse) emission sources and potential emission reduction measures for several sectors including industry, households and agriculture.","Cost effectiveness analysis; Linear programming; Water framework directive; Water quality","conference proceeding; cost-benefit analysis; emission; environmental modeling; linear programing; policy making; river basin; surface water; water management; water quality; Belgium; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Flanders; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148954251

SABER is being used to measure earthlimb emissions and to characterize infrared radiation, allowing calculation of cooling rates and determination of composition and temperature profiles in the mesosphere, lower thermosphere, and ionosphere (60-180 km). The SABER telescope is an on-axis Cassegrain design with a picket-fence tuning fork chopper at the first focus and a clamshell re-imager to focus the image on the focal plane. The telescope was designed to reject stray light from the Earth and atmosphere outside the instrument's instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV). The baffle assembly contains a single-axis scan mirror, which permits the 2 km vertical IFOV of each detector to be scanned from the Earth to a 400 km tangent height. The telescope and baffle assembly are cooled to 220 K by a dedicated radiator. The focal plane assembly is cooled to 75 K by a miniature cryogenic refrigerator. Field programmable gate arrays are used to implement state machine algorithms for control and operation of the instrument and subsystems. Although originally designed for a two-year lifetime requirement, the SABER instrument has been in continuous operation since January 2002. This paper discusses the SABER instrument design and innovations developed to achieve the required performance, along with instrument performance and lessons learned from the program.","FiST; SABER; TIMED","FiST; Instantaneous field of view (IFOV); Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER); Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED); Broadband amplifiers; Product design; Radiometers; Radiometry; Satellites; Sensors; Upper atmosphere; Sounding apparatus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750572474

In single solution system, larger amounts of iron ion were adsorbed onto BC than onto CO and WB. Iron and lead ions were also found to compete in adsorption to BC in binary solution system. Furthermore, the amounts of the heavy metal ions adsorbed depended on the protein content of the vegetable biomass. However, because the vegetable biomass is rich in nutrients, they are likely to render drinking water treated with them liable to putrefaction.

The accurate understanding of its polarization properties is crucial to extract the cosmological information contained in the CMB polarization anisotropy. Radio surveys at n ∼ 1 GHz offer the unique opportunity to study Galactic synchrotron emission where it represents the dominant component, possibly except for regions close to the Galactic plane where free-free emission is also important. We review the observational status of Galactic radio surveys at scales θ ≳ 0.5°. Leiden surveys, thanks to their frequency coverage from 0.408 GHz to 1.411 GHz, still remain of fundamental importance for the comprehension of depolarization phenomena. Recent surveys at 1.42 GHz (in both total intensity and polarization) with a better sensitivity and sky sampling now cover both celestial hemispheres and allow to accurately map the correlation properties of the diffuse synchrotron emission. We present an analysis of these surveys in terms of angular power spectrum. A comparison of a simple frequency extrapolation of these results with the recent WMAP results shows that we are close to map the bulk of the diffuse synchrotron polarization fluctuations and to understand the corresponding implications for CMB experiments. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Licence.",,"Anisotropy; Cosmology; Polarization; Synchrotron radiation; Angular power spectrum; CMB polarization; Correlation properties; Cosmic microwave backgrounds; Galactic plane; Polarization fluctuations; Polarization properties; Synchrotron emission; Surveys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055680649

Accurate quantifications of pollutant emissions from AFOs, including commercial broiler (meat-bird) production systems, are needed to develop improved emissions inventories and emission factors and determine if regulatory emission reporting requirements are exceeded. Collection of air emissions data proposed to be used as representative data for southeastern U.S. broiler operations in the national Air Compliance Agreement is currently being conducted cooperatively by Iowa State University and The University of Kentucky. Two mechanically ventilated commercial broiler houses located in western Kentucky are being monitored for a period of one year. This study includes the quantification of building emissions for ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), total suspended particulates (TSP), particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10) and particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). Two mobile air emission monitoring units were designed and fabricated at Iowa State University during the summer of 2005. Monitoring system installation was completed in fall 2005, and monitoring for all pollutants was initiated in January 2006. The mobile air emission monitoring units include a system to quantify pollutant concentrations within the broiler houses and a system to quantify the volume of air exhausted from each broiler house by the ventilation fans. Ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane and total hydrocarbon concentrations are measured using INNOVA 1412 photoacoustic multi-gas monitors. Hydrogen sulfide concentrations are measured using Teledyne API 101E pulsed fluorescence analyzers. Total hydrocarbons, non-methane hydrocarbons and methane are also measured using a VIG-200 gas chromatograph. Continuous measurement of air flow from each house is accomplished by measuring building static pressure and the operational status of each ventilation fan. The fan operation status in conjunction with building static pressure is applied to in situ calibration fan curves developed for each fan using FANS (FAN Assessment Numeration System) units built at the University of Kentucky. Compact Field Point data acquisition hardware is utilized in conjunction with a custom data acquisition program written in Labview 7.

Solar thermal absorption cooling systems use chillers powered by solar energy rather than natural gas or electricity. The following factors may position solar thermal absorption cooling systems as a competitive alternative to conventional electric- or natural gas-driven air conditioning: •Recent technology advances have occurred in concentrating solar thermal direct flow vacuum tube-type collectors. •The Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes a non-capped 30% Investment Tax Credit for solar thermal cooling systems on commercial buildings. •Natural gas retail prices are near record highs, increasing peak electricity rates. •Use of renewable energy powered cooling systems can lead to lower electric demand and reduced power plant emissions. Initial assessment results show that solar thermal cooling systems are feasible in areas with a confluence of high solar insolation, high cooling demand, and high electric rates, achieving payback of less than 8 years in typical five-story buildings. In smaller commercial and institutional buildings, solar thermal absorption cooling system life-cycle costs are also favorable in comparison to conventional cooling systems.

The City needs a tool to quantify the environmental effects of planned transportation control and urban development measures. The CALMOB6 program calculates emissions and fuel consumption effects of proposed developments or regulations before they are implemented, aiding in selecting the most suitable project. The program handles the criteria air pollutants (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and particulates) and greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and methane), as well as fuel consumption rates for vehicles operating in an urban region. CALMOB6 uses the output of urban travel forecasting models (such as EMME/2 or VISSIM) to describe vehicle movements. With this as a base, the model develops a second-by-second speed trace for each vehicle type in a particular traffic situation based on both the traffic model output and local parameters such as road grade and ambient weather conditions. The vehicle speed trace matches the specified average speed while incorporating stops, idling times, permissible speeds and realistic acceleration rates for each vehicle class. A class-specific vehicle dynamic model is applied to this speed trace to calculate a tractive power trace which is then applied to emissions and fuel consumption functions developed at the University of Alberta. The emissions functions for each vehicle class are calibrated against emission rates embodied in the US EPA's MOBILE6, (hence CALMOB6) as a standard for vehicles driving EPA test cycles. Similarly, fuel consumption is calibrated against past fleet fuel economy and extended with future fuel economy trends obtained from technical literature.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Environmental Protection Agency; Fuel economy; Greenhouse gases; MATLAB; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Speed; Tools; Transportation; Urban growth; Consumption modeling; Criteria air pollutants; Fuel consumption rates; Technical literature; Traffic situations; Transportation control; Transportation planners; Vehicle dynamic model; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898402129

Accordingly, advancements are needed not only in clean-up and control technologies, but also in the monitoring of mercury emissions. To meet the need for a real-time, speciating mercury analyzer, we are developing laser-based techniques for stand-off, sensitive detection of the two forms of vapor-phase mercury emitted by coal-fired power plants, Hg0 and HgCl2. The approach for measuring HgCl2 concentration in combustion flue gas is to detect emission at 254 nm from Hg(6 3p1) fragments produced by the photodissociation of HgCl2 at 210 nm. Selection of a laser wavelength that is not resonant with ground state transitions of Hg0 ensures that the laser photofragment emission (PFE) technique is selective for HgCl 2, even in the presence of large quantities of Hg0. The PFE method was characterized and quantified by evaluating the potential impact of interference gases, determining the dependence of the HgCl2 PFE signal on laser irradiance, and examining the effects of collisional quenching by flue gas constituents N2, O2, and CO2. In addition, time-resolved measurements of the atomic emission provide insight into both the preparation and decay of the Hg (6 3p1) state. Extension of the PFE technique to a fieldable instrument requires a UV laser source that is not subject to the physical limitations of conventional laboratory laser systems. In addition to producing high average and peak powers with excellent beam quality, the laser source must be compact, rugged, and light weight. Frequency conversion of pulsed, rare-earth-doped fiber lasers has the potential to meet these requirements for a practical laser source. Recent experiments in our laboratory using the frequency-quintupled output of a Sandia-built fiber laser at 213 nm have demonstrated the ability to detect trace amounts of HgCl2 in an environment characteristic of flue gas. Using this source, we achieved a detection limit of 0.5 ppb for a signal acquisition time of 5 minutes. While this detection sensitivity meets the requirements for real-time monitoring of the HgCl2 concentration in a flue gas environment, ongoing efforts to increase the output power of fiber lasers will enable the realization of equivalent detection limits with decreased signal acquisition times and/or greater stand-off distances.",,"Activated carbon; Adsorption; Coal fired boilers; Flue gases; Gas emissions; Petroleum coke; Thermodynamic stability; Laser photofragment emission (PFE); Mercury analyzers; Mercury emissions; Mercury exposure; Mercury (metal)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748910597

To test this hypothesis, historical, museum-archived shells, collected live on known dates prior to AD 1950 from coastal locations in NW Scotland, were 14C dated to provide a means of determining R(t) and hence the regional deviation (ΔR) from the modeled global surface ocean reservoir age (R). The sea loch data, when combined with 14C dates from the Scottish west coast (Harkness 1983), yield a regional ΔR value of -26 ±14 yr. The ΔR of sea loch (fjordic) and coastal waters of NW Scotland are statistically different (at a confidence level &gt;95%) from the ΔR value of 17 ±14 yr reported for UK coastal waters (Reimer 2005; data after Harkness 1983) and are in good agreement with the coastal ΔR value of-33 ± 93 yr reported by Reimer et al.

In this paper, we present results of time-resolved photoluminescence from samples grown using two different approaches to achieve green emission from InGaN/GaN MQWs. In one approach, samples, with high indium incorporation, were grown on a high quality AlN substrate to achieve green emission. The resulting photoluminescence decay of the green luminescence is long-lived and non-exponential. Quantitative analysis showed that the decay has a stretched-exponential characteristic, typical of InGaN/GaN MQW with potential fluctuation along the growth plane. This carrier localization, in a structure with low defect density, proves to be an effective means to achieve green emission. In another approach, a piezoelectric Stark-like ladder effect is used. In this case, a methodical layer-by-layer growth homogeneity optimization process was adopted to achieve an optical transition below the electron to heavy-hole (e1hh1) transition when the quantum well is subjected to the strong piezoelectric polarization dipole. This approach has proven to be successful in achieving green luminescence on conventional sapphire substrates. The resulting photoluminescence decay at 14 K, of a sample grown by this approach, is single exponential and shorter in duration than the decay observed in the first approach. This exponential decay is consistent with previous AFM studies that revealed a homogeneous active region. © 2006 Materials Research Society.",,"Chemical analysis; Heterojunctions; Light emitting diodes; Luminescence; Optimization; Piezoelectric devices; Polarization; Ultrafast phenomena; Green emitting InGaN MQW LED; Green luminescence; Photoluminescence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750057019

The contributions of private cars, public cars, buses and delivery trucks were examined at a sampling site located downtown. The aerosol monitor was operated from September 2001 to September 2002. The study employed an IMPROVE PM10 sampler with Anderson inlet at 3 meters above ground collecting PM10 on Teflon membrane filter, nylon and quartz filter. Sulfate concentrations were lower than soil, nitrate, elemental and organic carbon, which contributed significantly to PM10 mass. Soil accounted for 25% of the PM10 mass and carbon particles accounted for just over 50%. Transportation sources appear to be primary sources of the carbon and soil particles. The remaining mass was mostly secondary ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate. Some metals, such as V, Ni, Br, and Pb, were measured frequently at the downtown site. They did not contribute appreciably to the PM10 mass, but underscore the importance of transportation sources to measured particulate matter.","Aerosol speciation; Elemental concentrations; Nitrate; Organic and elemental carbon; PM10; Soil; Sulfate","Aerosols; Buses; Nitrates; Organic carbon; Soils; Transportation; Trucks; Urban planning; Aerosol speciation; Elemental carbon; Elemental concentrations; Sulfates; Air pollution; aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; conference proceeding; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; public transport; seasonal variation; urban transport; Bio-Bio; Chile; Chillan; South America; Chilia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148955090

Ranging from the early identification and framing of this problem in the mid 1980s through the Kyoto Protocol's entry into force in 2005, Cass focuses on two normative debates that were critical to the development of climate policy-who should bear primary responsibility for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and what principles would guide these reductions. He examines why some nations, but not others, have met their commitments, and concludes that while many states affirmed the international norms, most did not fully translate them into domestic policy.

They contribute to a high amplitude of variation on the time scale of one day. This has significant impacts on the climate of the earth. Current cloud parameterization schemes have significant deficiency to predict the diurnal cycle of cloud cover a few days in advance. The present study addresses this issue utilizing a two fold approach. We used four versions of the Florida State University (FSU) global spectral model (GSM) including four different cloud parameterization schemes in order to construct ensemble/superensemble forecasts of cloud covers. The results show that it is possible to substantially reduce the 1-5 days forecast errors of phase and amplitude of the diurnal cycle of clouds with this methodology. Further, a unified cloud parameterization scheme is developed for climate models, which, when implemented in the FSU GSM, carries a higher skill compared to those of the individual cloud schemes. This study shows that while the multimodel superensemble is still the best product in forecasting the diurnal cycle of clouds, a unified cloud parameterization scheme, used in a single model, also provides higher skills compared to the individual cloud models. Moreover, since this unified scheme is an integral part of the model, the overall forecast skill improves both in terms of radiative fluxes and precipitation and thus has a greater impact on both weather and climate time scales.",,"Climate models; Cloud covers; Diurnal cycle; Global spectral model (GSM); Data reduction; Earth atmosphere; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); Weather forecasting; Clouds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846984996

The influential factors on volatilization mass were primarily related to the affinity of the VOCs to the soils and to the surfactant solutions. The results show that the VOC emissions are a function of Koc, the surfactant properties and the Sw and P of the VOC. Nonionic surfactants could more effectively wash the VOCs away from the soil, leading to relatively higher emissions. When the surfactant concentrations exceeded the critical micelle concentrations (CMCs), VOC partitioning into the surfactant sorbed on the soil surface to reduce the VOC emissions. Whether the VOC can freely dissolve in the solution is the key point in determining the volatilization parameters. The emission of dissolved VOC is dependent on KOL and Sw. The P is the major parameter governing the emission of VOCs in an insoluble state. The solution properties can strongly affect the emissions of low Sw compounds due to solubility enhancement effects.

Proponents of coal-burning power plants assert that methylmercury is not a hazard at the current environmental levels, that current technologies for limiting emissions are unreliable, and that reducing mercury emissions from power plants in the United States will have little impact on environmental levels. Opponents of coal-burning plants assert that current methylmercury exposures from fish are damaging to the developing nervous system of infants, children, and the fetus; that current technology can significantly limit emissions; and that reducing emissions will reduce exposure and risk. One concern is that local mercury emissions from power plants may contribute to higher local exposure levels, or ""hot spots."" The impact of the Mercury Rule on potential hot spots is uncertain due to the highly site-specific nature of the relationship between plant emissions and local fish methylmercury levels. The impact on the primary source of exposure in the United States, ocean fish, is likely to be negligible due to the contribution of natural sources and industrial sources outside the United States. Another debate centers on the toxic potency of methylmercury, with the scientific basis of the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) recommended exposure limit questioned by some and defended by others. It is likely that the EPA's exposure limit may be appropriate for combined exposure to methylmercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), but may be lower than the available data suggest is necessary to protect children from methylmercury alone. Mercury emissions from power plants are a global problem. Without a global approach to developing and implementing clean coal technologies, limiting US power plant emissions alone will have little impact. © 2006 Medscape.",,"methylmercury; polychlorinated biphenyl; methylmercury derivative; air monitoring; air pollution; air pollution control; article; electric power plant; environmental exposure; environmental health; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; fish; food contamination; geographic distribution; health hazard; human; ischemic heart disease; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; prenatal exposure; public health; risk assessment; risk reduction; United States; air pollution; electric power plant; environmental exposure; review; risk management; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Methylmercury Compounds; Power Plants; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644837281

The introduction of computer controlled electro-mechanical valves, radiator fans, and coolant pumps require mathematic models and real time algorithms to implement intelligent thermal control strategies for prescribed engine temperature tracking. Smart butterfly valves can replace the traditional wax-based thermostat to control the coolant flow based on both engine temperature and operating conditions. The electric water pump and radiator fan replace the mechanically driven components to reduce unnecessary engine loads at high speeds and provide better cooling at low speeds. However, implementation of electro-mechanical actuators including the alternator and electrical storage devices introduces inefficiencies in mechanical to electrical energy conversion (and electrical to mechanical energy conversion), which may require increased fuel consumption over pure mechanical components. Empirical models can provide realistic component data used in simulation tools during the development process, and also define the basis for cooling system control algorithms. In this paper, a general framework to derive these empirical models is investigated for thermal management systems where the engine temperature must be accurately controlled in both steady state and transient operation. The evolution of automotive cooling systems also requires a paradigm shift in the engine block design. The design changes include isolated cylinder water jackets, temperature sensor arrays, and distributed smart valves to enable distinct cylinder-by-cylinder temperature maintenance for optimum combustion. This paper explores the introduction of a 'coolant rail' to accommodate specific cylinder temperature control defined by an on-demand cylinder dependent cooling strategy.

Two key events made it a significant year for air quality management in Europe. Firstly, the European limit value for PM10 came into force at the beginning of the year (followed later by widespread failure to comply with it). Later in 2005, after considerable debate, the European Commission launched its Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution, setting out its vision for air quality management up to 2020. In the context of these events, this paper looks at the state of air quality management in the UK, Europe and further a field and asks whether the nature of the current frameworks for air quality management and their implementation are any longer sufficient for tackling air pollution problems at a local, national and European scale. Air pollution, in the UK at least, is largely a symptom of the country's transport problems with over 90% of Air Quality Management Areas in the UK being declared in relation to transport related sources. Despite the evidence of the strong relationship between transport, air pollution and AQMAs the government has 'revised' its 10-year transport plan, removing its commitment to a reduction in traffic and instead has committed itself to planning for considerable increases in road traffic. Given the predicted increases of traffic and its associated emissions is there any evidence to suggest that the air quality management regime is able to deliver the intended outcome of improved air quality?","Air quality management; LAQM; Planning policy; Pollution; Thematic strategy; Transport","air quality; atmospheric pollution; conference proceeding; emission control; environmental management; pollution control; traffic emission; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148993596

It emphasizes particularly on confirming the relation of data in different fields. It tries to find out the dependence of data in multi-fields. As we know, in GIS the spatial database is often separated into several layers or tables according the type of the spatial object such as road layer, building layer, plant layer etc. In the relational database we often separate it into several tables which be associated by the primary key and foreign key according the normal form theory. Consequently, the spatial data is stored in different layers and tables. It is necessary and meaning to mining the knowledge and rules in multi-layer and multi-tables. And, It is inevitable to mining spatial association rules in multi-layer in some application. There is a problem in it, that is the number of the rules are magnitude. So, we point a new way by using the cell pattern of the rules which the user interested to reduce and simplify the operation. In this paper the concept of multi_layer spatial association rule is put forward. Then an algorithm of mining multi_layer spatial association rule is presented which based on cell pattern and spatial concept relation. It was called AP_MLSAM in the paper. Last, an example in GIS is given. In AP_MLSAM, Fisrt,it confirms the patterns and rules that the user interested. Second it counts the large itemsets according with the cell pattern in each data layer. Last,the spatial association rules are gained by the itemsets which be counted in the second step. From the experiment, it proved that AP_MLSAM is effective. It improved the efficiency by reducing the time of finding the large itemsets. It is a significance research field for mining multi_layer spatial association rules .There are many applications based on multi_layer spatial association analyse. For example : traffic flux analyse in city, weather pattern analyse, trend analyse for climate and plant. All these applications request mining the association rules in the mass data. It is necessary to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. And this paper offers a new way to mine multi_layer spatial association rule based on concept relation using cell pattern.","Cell pattern; GIS; Spatial association rule; Spatial data mining","Cell pattern; Spatial association rule; Spatial data mining; Data mining; Database systems; Geographic information systems; Knowledge based systems; Problem solving; Algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846818533

These aspects are studied using fluorescence microscopy, profilometry, and optical absorption and emission spectroscopies. Room temperature analysis of the poly(di- n -octylfluorene) indicates that the combination of high-speed deposition and rapid drying process traps the polymer into a metastable conformational state. Optical spectroscopy at reduced temperature identifies emission from at least two distinct conformational chromophores. At elevated temperature there is an abrupt, irreversible transition to a more conventional structural form.

The 2007 government standards for emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) will also become more restrictive. There is the additional concern that crankcase emissions from present day trucks and buses may impact the quality of air inside the vehicle. This paper presents data to characterize crankcase emissions and examines a crankcase emissions abatement system (CEAS), the New Condensator®, manufactured by World NCI. Rather than allowing crankcase emissions to leave via a vent tube, a CEAS re-circulates the emissions to the intake of the engine. In this study, crankcase and tailpipe emissions were measured from a 1996 Peterbilt tractor truck powered by a Caterpillar 3406, 550hp engine with approximately 400,000 accumulated miles, to quantify the emissions benefits of closing the crankcase with the CEAS. Emissions were measured while the vehicle was exercised through the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) at a test weight of 56,000 lbs. Crankcase emissions were directed to a dilution system for measurement of regulated species. The total diluted crankcase flow was passed through filters which served to measure total crankcase PM and the filters were subsequently analyzed for hopanes and stearanes as markers for lubricating oil to determine the source of the collected PM. From the overall analysis, crankcase total PM was the highest species relative to tailpipe emissions at 5.66%. Crankcase HC, CO and NOx were 3.68%, 1.25% and 0.09% of the tailpipe emissions, respectively. The tailpipe emissions were also measured after closing the crankcase with the installation of the CEAS. Then, to condition the CEAS, the tractor was operated for a total of 13,400 miles with the CEAS installed. After this mileage accumulation, the tailpipe emissions were again measured on the chassis dynamometer with and without the CEAS installed. In addition to measuring PM mass, the researchers characterized the size distribution of the dilute crankcase PM with a Cambustion DMS 500. The total particle number concentrations were in the order of 107 per cm3, and the mean size of the particles was approximately 70nm.

The objective of this study was to provide data that may enable ambient emissions investigators to m,odel the air quality more accurately. The 25 vehicles reported in this paper are from the first phase of a program to determine representative regulated emissions from Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Trucks (HHDDT) operating in Southern California. Emissions data were gathered using a chassis dynamometer, full flow dilution tunnel, and research grade analyzers. The subject program employed two truck test weights and four new test modes (one was idle operation), in addition to the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), and the AC50/80 cycle. The reason for such a broad test cycle scope was to determine thoroughly how HHDDT emissions are influenced by operating cycle to improve accuracy of models. Overall, it was determined from these Phase 1 data that oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions did not decrease in relation to the HHDDT Model Year (MY) and all MY bins produced about 20 g/mile of NO x on the UDDS. However, particulate matter (PM) emissions decreased in relation to MY and hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions showed a slight decrease in relation to MY for some of the test schedules. For idle operation, NOx emissions were lowest for the pre-1990 MY group of HHDDT. After reading results of this study, readers are likely to appreciate the challenges that have been faced by air quality investigators as they attempt to incorporate emissions inventory data into ambient models.

Box 1, Chester, CH1 3SH, United Kingdom","Worldwide concern about air quality has led to ever-tougher emissions legislation for vehicles and a concomitant tightening of fuel specifications. However, not all countries or regions will move at the same rate. For example, parts of Europe and the US have already seen the introduction of the so-called ""sulphur-free"" fuels (i.e. <10 and <15ppm S). However, in many developing countries there are fuel specifications with sulphur limits in higher range of 1500 - 2500ppm, and other properties are also more relaxed, such as distillation or density. For a future world where larger volumes of GTL Fuel are available (2010 and beyond), it is essential to know the environmental impact of using both neat GTL and GTL blends, when compared to conventional market diesel. Moreover it is important to take into account the significant variation still anticipated for specifications of diesel between different countries. Thus, two light-duty vehicle studies have been performed covering both a wide range of engine technologies and fuel quality, in anticipation of the expected future scenarios in 2010 and beyond. The first test sequence focused on vehicles with Euro 2 and 3 emissions levels, with reference fuels representing a relaxed specification. The second test exercise was aimed at vehicles complying with Euro 4 emission standards, in conjunction with reference fuels representative of a stringent specification.

We show that the measure of the charge displaced during CO adsorption allows the determination of the potential of zero total charge (PZTC). The estimation of the potential of zero free charge (PZFC) is discussed, with different degrees of approximation. The application of this methodology to the study of the PZTC of platinum stepped surfaces vicinal to Pt(111) reveals a marked decrease of the PZTC due to the introduction of surface steps. This effect is interpreted as the result of the existence of markedly smaller surface potentials localized on step sites. The importance of considering local aspects of the interface is emphasized with the use of N2O reduction as a sensitive probe to the local structure of the surface. It is proposed that the different local maxima observed in the absolute value of the reduction current correspond to the local values of PZTC. It is shown that there is, in general, good agreement between the overall PZTC, obtained from the CO displacement, and that calculated from the local values inferred from the N2O reduction. Further insight is obtained with the application of the laser-induced temperature jump method. This technique is useful to calculate the potential of maximum entropy of the double-layer formation. The resulting value of this potential for Pt(111) is discussed in the light of the PZFC value obtained from different approaches. For stepped surfaces vicinal to Pt(111), two local maxima in the entropy of the double layer are observed that are close to the local PZTC values estimated from the N2O reduction. This result suggests the existence of cooperative effects in the organization of the water dipoles close to the electrode surface. © Nauka/Interperiodica 2006.","Potential of zero total charge; Single-crystal platinum","Electric potential; Electrochemical electrodes; Entropy; Interfaces (materials); Platinum; Reduction; Laser- nduced temperature jump method; Potential of zero total charge (PZTC); Single crystal platinum; Surfaces vicinal; Single crystals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751275263

Subsequent 24-hr time-integrated VOC canister sampling found that concentrations of benzene exceeded the State guidelines. While this type of sampling was able to determine guidelines were being exceeded, the frequency and time-resolution of sampling were not sufficient to identify the primary sources of benzene emissions. Surrounding industry joined together to conduct supplemental air monitoring to identify benzene emissions sources affecting concentrations measured at the State monitoring site. A two-phase monitoring approach was proposed and implemented. A benzene air monitoring survey was conducted within and along plant boundaries using passive dosimeters and portable handheld instruments. A real-time automated GC (auto-GC), capable of measuring sub-part-per-billion (ppb) levels of benzene, was installed adjacent to the States existing monitoring site. In general, 24-hr average benzene concentrations calculated from 5-min auto-GC data showed very good agreement with 24-hr benzene concentrations from canister data. Monitoring conducted during the survey was able to discover previously unidentified benzene source areas, while the ongoing auto-GC monitoring effort has been instrumental in tracking the progress of benzene emission reduction efforts, identifying benzene source areas, and providing industry members with near real-time notification when unexpectedly high benzene concentrations occur.

The project goal is to address the need to detect and ultimately quantify the presence of mercury in power plant flue gas emissions. An optical technique known as Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is being evaluated for this purpose. LIBS makes use of a tightly-focused laser beam to spark, or ablate, a chemical sample in either solid, liquid, or gaseous form. The emitted light is then analyzed by a spectrometer to determine constituent elements. Whereas the technique involved in LIBS has been demonstrated time and again in a variety of applications, the challenge at hand is the integration of the technique to on-line power plant flue gas analysis. Current work involves a sample acquisition means by which flue gas might be collected on a substrate, then subjected to LIBS analysis. Challenges to be addressed include exposing the substrate to the appropriate environment and ensuring sufficient elemental concentration for detection. Initial LIBS results with coal and coal ash, in lieu of flue gas, will be presented. Furthermore, pedagogical issues, such as employing a juniorlevel design course to perform real-world engineering on environmental and other problems, will be discussed.","Coal; Engineering pedagogy; Flue gas; LIBS; Mercury; Power plant","Atomic emission spectroscopy; Coal; Coal ash; Curricula; Engineering education; Flue gases; Flues; Gas emissions; Laser beams; Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy; Mercury (metal); Power plants; Spectrometers; Teaching; Coal-fired power plant; Constituent elements; Electrical engineering curriculum; Elemental concentrations; Environmental issues; Laserinduced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS); LIBS; Western Kentucky University; Fossil fuel power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84915821045

In the Antarctic terrestrial environment, the severe stresses experienced combined with geographical isolation and the relative youth of most habitats are generally accepted to underlie the low contemporary terrestrial biodiversity that is found. Currently faced with rates of regional climate change that are amongst the most rapid seen on the planet (Quayle et al. 2002, Vaughan et al. 2003), Antarctic terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems are expected to show particular sensitivity and rapid responses (Freckman and Virginia 1997, Quayle et al. 2002, 2003). The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment (IPCC 2001) has singled out the polar regions as areas of special concern. Climate change is not a new challenge for Antarctic biota. During the Pleistocene and Holocene, systematic variations in climate and ice cover are well documented (eg Hjort et al. 2003). During recent centuries there is evidence of glacial advances analogous to those of the Little Ice Age experienced in Europe while, over the last 1-10 000 years, there have also been considerable fluctuations in glacial and ice shelf extent and thickness (Clapperton and Sugden 1982, 1988, Lorius et al. 1985, Smith 1990, Pudsey and Evans 2001).

Vertical lithofacies successions, which have recurrent stacking patterns, fit within high-frequency cycles. We define three ideal high-frequency cycles as: (1) upward-shallowing subtidal cycles, (2) upward-shallowing paralic cycles, and (3) aggradational subtidal cycles. Digital optical borehole images, tracers, and flow meters indicate that there is a predictable vertical pattern of porosity and permeability within the three ideal cycles, because the distribution of porosity and permeability is related to lithofacies. Stratiform zones of high permeability commonly occur just above flooding surfaces in the lower part of upward-shallowing subtidal and paralic cycles, forming preferential groundwater flow zones. Aggradational subtidal cycles are either mostly high-permeability zones or leaky, low-permeability units. In the study area, groundwater flow within stratiform high-permeability zones is through a secondary pore system of touching-vug porosity principally related to molds of burrows and pelecypods and to interburrow vugs. Movement of a dye-tracer pulse observed using a borehole fluid-temperature tool during a conservative tracer test indicates heterogeneous permeability. Advective movement of the tracer appears to be most concentrated within a thin stratiform flow zone contained within the lower part of a high-frequency cycle, indicating a distinctly high relative permeability for this zone. Borehole flow-meter measurements corroborate the relatively high permeability of the flow zone. Identification and mapping of such high-permeability flow zones is crucial to conceptualization of karst groundwater flow within a cyclostratigraphic framework. Many karst aquifers are included in cyclic platform carbonates. Clearly, a cyclostratigraphic approach that translates carbonate aquifer heterogeneity into a consistent framework of correlative units will improve simulation of karst groundwater flow. © 2006 Geological Society of America.","Borehole geophysics; Carbonate cyclostratigraphy; Florida; Hydrogeology; Karst","Aquifers; Boreholes; Carbonation; Flow measurement; Groundwater flow; Groundwater geochemistry; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Landforms; Lime; Limestone; Porosity; Well logging; Borehole geophysics; Conservative tracers; Cyclostratigraphy; Florida; High permeability zone; High-frequency cycles; Karst; Relative permeability; Flowmeters; aquifer; borehole geophysics; carbonate; cyclostratigraphy; flooding; flow; groundwater flow; heterogeneity; karst; limestone; lithofacies; permeability; porosity; preferential flow; simulation; tracer; Biscayne Aquifer; Florida [United States]; United States; Bivalvia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73949107423

Small scooters, which are very much used in the congested centers of several cities are a remarkable source of air pollution. Therefore every effort to reduce the emissions is an important contribution to improve the air quality in urban centers. In the present work detailed investigations of particle emissions of different 2-stroke scooters with direct injection and with carburetor were performed. The nanoparticulate emissions with different lube oils and fuels were measured by means of SMPS, (CPC) and NanoMet). Also the particle mass emission (PM) was measured with the same method as for Diesel engines. Extensive analyses of PM-residuum for PAH &amp; SOF/INSOF, as well as for VOC were carried out in an international project network. It can be stated, that the oil and fuel quality have a considerable influence on the particle emissions, which are mainly oil condensates. The engine technology influences the (nano)particle emissions by: mixture preparation, mixture tuning, oil consumption, postoxidation, quality, condition and temperature of the catalyst. Since the particulate emission of the 2-S consists mainly of lube oil condensates the minimization of oil consumption stays always an important goal. The amount of total PAH, as well as the toxicity equivalence factor TEQ correlate roughly with the total particle mass PM.

The lack of a hydrogen distribution infrastructure and the lack of dense hydrogen storage technology are fundamental roadblocks along this path. One alternative approach is to use a high energy-density liquid fuel (natural or synthetic, such as methanol) as an intermediate hydrogen carrier, and generate the hydrogen on demand in an onboard fuel processor. This demands, however, development of technologies for on-board CO2 capture, storage, and recycling to eliminate direct emission into the atmosphere. This paper presents a thermodynamic analysis of feasibility of on-board carbon dioxide sequestration as well as various process/design schemes for the hybrid power generation-CO2 sequestration system. The primary difficulty in capturing CO2 from small-scale power plants (such as the internal combustion engine) is the extremely diluted state of CO2 in the exhaust gases. In contrast, onboard fuel processors have the potential to provide a highly concentrated CO2 exhaust stream, which could be separated, liquefied, and stored onboard at ambient temperatures with a minimal energy penalty. Current research efforts in small scale fuel processing are focused on producing a hydrogen-rich (or pure) stream from liquid hydrocarbon fuel with high yield and at a sufficient rate to provide the necessary vehicle power. Very few efforts reported in the open literature also address the need to capture the byproduct CO2 that is produced. The additional requirement of CO2 capture calls for fundamental change in the fuel processing strategy and reformer design. Several process or design schemes for fuel processing are identified, which produce hydrogen while allowing for CO2 capture. For example, in autothermal reforming of hydrocarbon or alcohol fuels, catalytic reactions of the fuel with air yield a product stream (hydrogen and CO2) that is diluted with nitrogen. Under the added constraint of CO2 capture, advanced oxygen membranes could be used to supply pure oxygen rather than air to the reaction, resulting in a more concentrated, nitrogen-free product stream which is favorable for CO2 capture. Simultaneously, this improves the efficiency of downstream hydrogen purification and utilization processes; thus, the penalties associated with CO2 capture are partially offset. In a similar manner, steam reforming of liquid fuels may not be the most attractive fuel processing option for automotive applications without consideration of CO 2 capture. However, because the product stream is never diluted with air, it becomes a very attractive option for integrated fuel processing/CO 2 sequestration systems. Consideration of CO2 capture early in the design stages of the fuel processing system allows a portion of the energetic penalty for CO2 sequestration to be recovered. While the design, analysis, and demonstration of an integrated onboard fuel processor with CO2 capture and storage is the ultimate goal, this technology is relevant to all small-scale, distributed power generation applications and should be an integral part of future CO2 abatement strategies.

In addition, the computed results are compared with the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) results and are also validated against the experimental data. The LDI combustors are a new generation of liquid fuel combustors developed to reduce aircraft NOx emission to 70% below the 1996 International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards and to maintain carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons at their current low levels at low power conditions. The concern in the stratosphere is that NOx would react with the ozone and deplete the ozone layer. This paper investigates the non-reacting aerodynamics characteristics of the flow associated with these new combustors using a RANS computational method. For the single-element LDI combustor, the experimental model consists of a cylindrical air passage with air swirlers and a converging-diverging venturi section, extending to a confined 50.8-mm square flame tube. The air swirlers have helical, axial vanes with vane angles of 60 degree. The air is highly swirled as it passes through the 60 degree swirlers and enters the flame tube. The nine-element LDI combustor is comprised of 9 elements that are designed to fit within a 76 mm 76 mm flame-tube combustor. In the experimental work, the jet-A liquid fuel is supplied through a small diameter fuel injector tube and is atomized as it exits the tip and enters the flame tube. The swirling and mixing of the fuel and air induces recirculation zone that anchors the combustion process, which is maintained as long as a flammable mixture of fuel and air is supplied. It should be noted that in the numerical simulation reported in this paper, only the non-reacting flow is considered. The numerical model encompasses the whole experimental flow passage, including the flow development sections for the air swirlers, and the flame tube. A low Reynolds number K-e turbulence model is used to model turbulence. Several RANS calculations are performed to determine the effects of the grid resolution on the flow field. The grid is refined several times until no noticeable change in the computed flow field occurred; the final refined grid is used for the detailed computations. The results presented are for the final refined grid. The final grids are all hexahedron grids containing approximately 861,823 cells for the single-element and 1,567,296 cells for the nine-element configuration. Fine details of the complex flow structure such as helical-ring vortices, re-circulation zones and vortex cores are well captured by the simulation. Consistent with the non-reacting experimental results, the computation model predicts a major re-circulation zone in the central region, immediately downstream of the fuel nozzle, and a second, recirculation zone in the upstream corner of the combustion chamber.

However, inhalable particulate and ozone still are a serious problem. Ozone levels have remained constant and have frequently exceeded air quality standards. Levels of ozone depend on the presence of organic compounds and nitrogen oxides in the air, which emissions are still increasing in the region. Besides ozone formation, organic compounds can be toxic, several of them with proven carcinogenic effect. In this work, measurements, levels and sources of dioxins, furans and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were reviewed. The results show that air levels and emissions of vehicles have importance, but industry emissions in urban areas and open burning in rural areas should also be addressed; measures should be taken to reduce them. Moreover, a wider program involving these toxic substances should be implemented, and it should contain an emission inventory and an emission reduction scheme, aiming at the prevention of health effects, especially neoplasias.","Atmosphere; Brazil; Dioxins; Furans; PAH; São Paul; Toxic pollutants","air quality; atmospheric pollution; conference proceeding; emission inventory; industrial emission; metropolitan area; organic pollutant; ozone; PAH; suspended particulate matter; toxic substance; urban area; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148935596

In this work, an experimental characterization of methane oxidation in mild conditions was carried out in a simple laboratory-scale system as a function of dilution level, C/O ratio, and inlet temperature. The framework outlined by the experimental analyses underlines that extreme working conditions, very different from the ones used in traditional combustion processes, can lead to a very complex system behavior. Several thermokinetic regimes corresponding to static and dynamic conditions were recognized. An accurate characterization of the dynamic region was performed, identifying several temperature oscillation typologies. On the basis of the obtained results, the range of reliability of mild combustion processes were defined. It was pointed out that the range of dynamic behavior can be overcome by splitting the whole combustion process into two stages, where the first one evolves in diluted rich conditions.

The determination of these optimal control strategies, subject to limitations imposed by production and injection constraints, is an area of much active research and generally involves coupling some form of control logic to a reservoir simulator. Some of these strategies are reactive: interventions are made when conditions are met at particular wells or valves, with no account taken for the effect on the future lifetime of the reservoir. Moreover, it may be too late to prevent unwanted breakthrough when the intervention is applied. Alternative proactive strategies may be applied to the lifetime of the field and fluid flow controlled early enough to delay breakthrough. This paper presents a proactive, gradient-based method to optimize production throughout the field life. This method requires the formulation of a constrained optimization problem, where bottom-hole pressure or target flow rates of wells, or flow rates of groups, represent the controllable parameters. To control a large number of wells or groups at a reasonably high frequency, efficient calculation of accurate well sensitivities (gradients) is required. Hence, the ad-joint method has been implemented in a commercial reservoir simulator to compute these gradients. Once these have been calculated, the simulator can be run in optimization mode to find a locally optimal objective function (e.g., cumulative production). This optimization procedure usually involves progressively activating constraints, with each new constraint representing a significant improvement in the objective. Proper management of degrees of freedom of the parameters is essential when calculating the constrained optimization search direction. Ad-joint methods have already been used for production optimization within reservoir simulation; however, an accurate analysis of optimal management of active and inactive constraints for different type of recovery processes in field-like cases has not been discussed to our knowledge.",,"Constrained optimization; Flow rate; Simulators; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Controllable parameters; Cumulative production; Gradient-based method; Optimal control strategy; Optimization procedures; Production optimization; Reservoir simulation; Petroleum reservoirs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896307244

Many countries, including the United States, wrestle with balancing economic development and meeting critical near-term environmental goals while minimizing longterm environmental risks. One promising solution to the buildup of GHGs in the atmosphere, being pursued by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and its industrial and academic partners, is carbon sequestration - a process of permanent storage of CO 2 emissions in underground geologic formations, thus avoiding CO 2 release to the atmosphere. This option looks particularly attractive for point source emissions of GHGs, such as fossil fuel fired power plants. CO 2 would be captured, transported to a sequestration site, and injected into an appropriate geologic formation. However, sequestration in geologic formations cannot achieve a significant role in reducing GHG emissions unless it is acceptable to stakeholders, regulators, and the general public, i.e., unless the risks involved are judged to be acceptable. One tool that can be used to achieve acceptance of geologic sequestration of CO 2 is risk assessment, which is a proven method to objectively manage hazards in facilities such as oil and natural gas fields, pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants. Although probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) has been applied in many areas, its application to geologic CO 2 sequestration is still in its infancy. The most significant risk from geologic carbon sequestration is leakage of CO 2 Two types of CO 2 releases are possible - atmospheric and subsurface. High concentrations of CO 2 caused by a release to the atmosphere would pose health risks to humans and animals, and any leakage of CO 2 back into the atmosphere negates the effort expended to sequester the CO 2. Subsurface risks, attributable to subsurface releases, arise from the displacement of fluids by the injected CO 2 that could damage nearby hydrocarbon resources or trigger small seismic events. There is also the potential for sequestered CO 2 to leak into non-saline formations, which could cause problems with potable uses of this water. However, overall, risks from CO 2 sequestration are believed to be small. Implementation of CO 2 sequestration is being approached in phases. The DOE is currently sponsoring a series of pilot tests to generate important data that will elucidate the risks involved in geologic sequestration and lead to the development of risk management protocols. This phased approach should ensure that potential sources of leakage are identified, consequences are quantified, events with the potential to cause harm are analyzed to estimate their frequency and associated risk, and safeguards are put in place to further reduce risks for an operation for which risks already appear to be low.","Carbon dioxide sequestration; Geologic sequestration; Risk assessment; Risk management","Atmospheric concentration; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Carbon sequestration; Earth's climate; Economic development; Environmental risks; Fossil fuel fired power plants; General publics; Geologic formations; Geologic sequestrations; GHG emission; High concentration; Hydrocarbon resources; Long-term storage; Management protocols; National Energy Technology Laboratory; Pilot tests; Point source emissions; Potential sources; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Risk assessment and managements; Seismic event; Subsurface release; U.S. Department of Energy; United states department of energies; Chemical plants; Cybernetics; Digital storage; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Industrial emissions; Information science; Information systems; Management information systems; Natural gas fields; Potable water; Public risks; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Saline water; Systems analysis; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867254871

Soil organic C variation was assessed at various scales within a small (40 ha; 98 ac), mixed-use watershed in central Pennsylvania to determine sampling requirement for possible C credit programs. Composite soil samples (0 to 5 cm; 0 to 2 in deep) were collected on 30-m (98-ft) grid intervals across the watershed and at 10- and 0.6-m (33- and 2-ft) intervals at selected locations, and descriptive- and geo-statistical analysis utilized. Concentrations of soil organic C in pasture and forest soils were approximately two times greater than cultivated fields, where means ranged from 15 to 24 g C kg-1 (1.5 to 2.4 percent) and coefficients of variation were typically 15 to 20 percent. Soil organic C was spatially dependent over a range of approximately 200 m (66ï ft) when sampled at 30-m (98-ft) intervals, and high nugget variances indicated spatially-dependent variability over lag distances shorter than 30 m (98ft). However, sampling at 10-m (33 ft) intervals appeared to adequately describe variation. Estimates of sample size requirement showed that, with the observed coefficient variances for individual fields, two- to five-fold increases in sample numbers would be required to verify statistically significant soil organic C changes ≤ 10 percent. Given the large number of samples required to provide representative measurements and the concurrent cost for labor and analysis, participation by farmers in a C credit program could be low if measured verification of soil organic C increases are required. Basing payments on modeled, rather than measured C sequestration rates, should be considered.","Geostatistics; Soil carbon sequestration; Spatial variability","organic carbon; soil carbon; soil organic matter; spatial variation; watershed; North America; Pennsylvania; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845343593

This article analyses how production and profits in the European cement industry may be affected by different approaches to the allocation of emissions allowances. We analyse two contrasting methods for the allocation of free allowances. With ‘grandfathering’, the number of allowances a firm gets is independent of its current behaviour. With ‘output-based allocation’, the number of allowances is proportional to the firm's current production level. Whereas almost all the quantitative assessments of the EU ETS assume grandfathering, the real allocation methods used by Member States, notably because of the updating every 5 years and of the special provisions for new plants and plant closings, stand somewhere between these two polar extremes. We study the impacts of these two contrasting allocation methods by linking a detailed trade model of homogeneous products with high transportation costs (GEO) with a bottom-up model of the cement industry (CEMSIM). The two allocation approaches have very different impacts on competitiveness and emissions abatements. Grandfathering 50% of past emissions to cement producers is enough to maintain aggregate profitability (EBITDA) at its business-as-usual level, but with significant production losses and CO2 leakage. For an output-based allocation over 75% of historic unitary (tCO2/tonnecement) emissions, the impact on production levels and EBITDA is insignificant, abatement in the EU is much lower, but there is almost no leakage. Policy makers need to recognize to what extent different allocation approaches may change the impacts of emissions trading, and adopt approaches accordingly. © 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Competitiveness; Grandfathering; Leakage; Output-based allocation","abatement cost; competitiveness; economic impact; emissions trading; environmental economics; industrial production; profitability; Eurasia; Europe; European Union",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747798346

For achieving the 2°C target with a probability of more than 60%, greenhouse gas concentrations need to be stabilized at 450 ppm CO2-equivalent or below, if the 90% uncertainty range for climate sensitivity is believed to be 1.5–4.5°C. A stabilization at 450 ppm CO2-equivalent or below (400 ppm) requires global emissions to peak around 2015, followed by substantial overall reductions of as much as 25% (45% for 400 ppm) compared to 1990 levels in 2050. In 2020, Annex I emissions need to be approximately 15% (30%) below 1990 levels, and non-Annex I emissions also need to be reduced by 15–20% compared to their baseline emissions. A further delay in peaking of global emissions by 10 years doubles maximum reduction rates to about 5% per year, and very probably leads to high costs. In order to keep the option open of stabilizing at 400 and 450 ppm CO2-equivalent, the USA and major advanced non-Annex I countries will have to participate in the reductions within the next 10–15 years. © 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Climate target; Multi-gas emission pathway; Post-2012 commitments","carbon dioxide; emission control; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249824264

The well documented climatic modification of the city is urban heat island. The present paper discusses the nature and intensity of heat islands at Visakhapatnam, the tropical coastal city of South India. A detailed study was carried out with regard to urban heat islands for the last ten years. The study reveals that the intensity of heat island varies from 2°C to 4°C and intensity is high during winter season compared to summer and monsoon seasons. At Visakhapatnam the formation of heat island is controlled by topography and urban morphology. The land and sea breeze circulation also interacts with the heat island. It has been found that cooling at night time is less inside the builtup area than the suburban. Urban cooling rates are compared with the sub-urban and rural environment. The urban heat island helps in setting up of the recirculation of pollutants thus making the pollution problems more serious. Heat island coupled with heat wave conditions during summer season causes human discomfort and higher death rates. At Visakhapatnam, summer months of April, May and June with maximum temperatures of 35°C to 40°C are uncomfortable with oppressive heat. There is a record of 94 heat waves during 1951-2000. Prevalence of heat wave conditions and heat island deteriorate the situation further and residents experience thermal stress and heat deaths. Thermal comfort can be improved by developing green belts which control temperature and reduce heat island effect. Cities must be planned with climate input to make the environments more pleasant and healthier places and to reduce undesirable effects.",,"Built-up areas; Coastal cities; Control temperatures; Cooling rates; Death rates; Green belts; Heat island; Heat island effect; Heat waves; Maximum temperature; Monsoon season; Night time; Pollution problems; Recirculations; Rural environment; Sea breeze circulation; South India; Summer months; Summer season; Thermal structure; Undesirable effects; Urban heat island; Urban morphology; Visakhapatnam; Winter seasons; Climatology; Environmental impact; Heat flux; Landforms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949289643

This means not only that more people than ever before will be living and working in cities, but also that more people and more goods will be making more and longer trips in urban areas. The costs of increasing dependence on cars is resulting in expensive road building and maintenance, clogged and congested roads, high levels of energy consumption along with its economic and environmental costs, worsening air and noise pollution, traffic accidents and social inequities that arise when the poor find transportation services increasingly unaffordable. The most widely used mode of conveyance of public transport in Delhi is ""buses"". Thus buses form a backbone of the transportation system in Delhi and serve about half of the travel demand while it constitutes less than 1 % of the total vehicle fleet of Delhi. In spite of this, it does not receive any preferential treatment in terms of traffic management, dedicated lanes, and better upkeep/ maintenance of vehicles resulting in that common man who can afford even slightly is shifting from buses to their own vehicles. It may be two-wheelers or four wheelers or even bicycles because of which the number of vehicles on the roads are increasing which is leading to further lowering of speed, congestion, increase in pollution level etc. Strategies to combat these problems would include reducing the emissions per vehicle kilometer traveled and the total number of kilometers traveled. Road congestion may be reduced by the use of good public transport management, traffic management and car pools etc. In this paper, we have conducted a survey based on a structured questionnaire for carpooling. By the analysis of the data collected, we found that if there is no carpooling, the amount required for 968316 Kilolitre petrol for 1289231 cars is Rs. 4213.14crores per annum while by carpooling, this amount reduces to Rs. 4213.14-1310.98 =2902.16 crores. Thus, a revenue of Rs. 1310.98 crores can be saved by saving 301307 Kilolitre petrol by carpooling in Delhi.","Carpooling; Congestion; Motor Vehicles; Public Transportation System","Carpooling; Congestion; Motor vehicle; Public transport management; Public transportation systems; Rapid urbanizations; Transportation services; Transportation system; Buses; Computer science; Energy utilization; Gasoline; Maintenance; Mass transportation; Military vehicles; Motor transportation; Noise pollution; Surveys; Traffic congestion; Accidents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862916332

Industrialized nations have adopted flue gas desulfurization (FGD) technologies to reduce SO2 emissions. FGD technologies will generate increased amounts of product in the future as more utilities install scrubbers for SO 2 control. These FGD products raise economic and environmental issues for which satisfactory solutions still need to be found. The type of coal and desulfurization process used influences the chemical composition and properties of an FGD product. The properties of the FGD material have a direct impact on potential land application uses. FGD properties most commonly captured for beneficial purposes are (1) ability to neutralize acid, (2) high amounts of soluble calcium and sulfate, (3) source of plant nutrients, and (4) uniform particle size. Land application uses of FGD materials are identified by matching the properties of the FGD material with improvement in some ecosystem function (or functions). For beneficial use, the change in ecosystem function is assumed to be positive. FGD use must be considered in terms of recommended application rates, environmental impact and economic return. Beneficial land application implies the applied FGD material will improve the soil (primarily) and also the total environment. Often, the intended benefit relates to plant growth, but there may be other benefits to soil or water such as reduction of erosion, improved quality of runoff and/or leachate water, or improved internal drainage. The application rate must be sufficient to cause soil improvement, but not so great as to constitute disposal of the FGD material. Although there is recognition of the potential of using FGD materials in agriculture, there is also uncertainty whether this use is sustainable. Currently, there is a general lack of acceptance in the agricultural community for using FGD materials. This barrier can only be overcome by research and sound knowledge that sometimes already exists in the scientific and technical literature. To promote use of FGD products, especially FGD gypsum, a national network of agricultural demonstration and research sites has been established.

The direct GHG emissions from natural gas are far below the ones from other fossil fuels like coal and oil. A measurement campaign at the Russian Northern and Central export pipelines was carried out by Wuppertal Institute in cooperation with Max-Planck Institute for Chemistry in 2003/2004, to close the existing gaps in available data and to improve the knowledge of the situation in the gas export grid in Russia. Five compressor stations in four different regions were investigated. Using a new approach, a complete GHG inventory of the gas export system was subsequently established, using the comprehensive Gazprom data set on planned emissions and energy use for compressor drives. The CH4 emissions from the Russian natural gas export network were below 1% of throughput. Emissions during production, processing, transport and storage were below the level found by previous measurements. Emissions fell within the range of 0.4-1.6% of the exported gas with 95% certainty. The main sources of emissions were primarily leaks or discharges from machines and valves at compressor stations and to a lesser extent, leaks from pipeline valves.

Extensive coastal swamps and an ever-wet, tropical climate supported lush growth of pteridosperm, marattialean fern, lycopsid, and calamite trees, and a wide array of ground cover and vines. As the Pennsylvanian passed into the Permian, the climate of the area became drier and more seasonal, the great swamps disappeared regionally, and aridity spread. The climatic inferences are based on changes in sedimentary patterns and paleosols as well as the general paleobotanical trends. The lithological patterns include a change from a diverse array of paleosols, including Histosols (ever-wet waterlogged soils), in the late Pennsylvanian to greatly diminished paleosol diversity with poorly developed Vertisols by the Early-Middle Permian transition. In addition, coal seams were present with wide areal distribution in the late Pennsylvanian whereas beds of evaporates were common by the end of the Early Permian. During this climatic transition, wetland plants were confi ned to shrinking ""wet spots"" found along permanent streams where the vegetation they constituted remained distinct if increasingly depauperate in terms of species richness. By Leonardian (late Early Permian) time, most of the landscape was dominated by plants adapted to seasonal drought and a deep water table. Wetland elements were reduced to scattered pockets, dominated primarily by weedy forms and riparian specialists tolerant of flooding and burial. By the Middle Permian, even these small wetland pockets had disappeared from the region. © 2006 Geological Society of America.","Climate change; Paleosols; Permian; Tropics; Wetlands","Climate change; Coal deposits; Groundwater; Lithology; Soils; Tropics; Vegetation; Areal distribution; Environmental tracking; Paleosols; Permian; Seasonal droughts; Tropical climates; Waterlogged soils; Wetland vegetation; Wetlands; aridity; Carboniferous; deep water; flooding; ground cover; paleosol; Permian; species richness; tracking; vegetation; water table; wetland; Midland Basin; Permian Basin; Texas; United States; Filicophyta; Lycopodiopsida; Marattiales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73949151251

Given that hydrogen can be produced from a variety of energy sources, it is considered by most to be the ultimate energy carrier for relieving the U.S. of its dependence on imported oil. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles operate via an electro-chemical process that converts pure hydrogen into water and electricity, producing zero emissions and potentially doubling the energy efficiency seen in today's gasoline-powered vehicles. This paper describes the USPS experiences gained during operational testing and evaluation of a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.

This matter becomes even more critical in rural areas where fewer facilities are present than in the city: lower life condition, lack of professionals, relative distance, and accessibility problems to city facilities are some factors which necessitate rural energy conservation. In this context, the Enghelab-e Eslami Housing Foundation introduced a research project to define climate-compatible design guidelines for rural housing that would reduce consumption of fossil fuels. Since no weather stations were located in these villages, the main obstacle to the researchers meant acquiring the required climatic information. The methodology relies first on regional geographic and climatic conditions, and second on observation of environmental strategies already applied in vernacular architecture of the region, namely residential architecture which has empirically evolved over the years to retain an energy-efficient design. This article covers the results of studying Ardebil Province, which has been divided into four climatic classes, and three architectural classes.

Both of these programs are specifically focused on the reduction or mitigation of CO2 equivalent emissions for new and expanded fossil fuel power plants located in these states. This paper provides a detailed description of both these programs, including an analysis of how the reduction/mitigation requirements will impact the siting of new generation in these states. In addition, this paper provides a comparison of this type of CO2 regulation to other approaches being implemented or proposed in other states or regions. For example, the Oregon and Washington laws both provide ""command-and- control"" type programs, which are focused on one industry and require the plant owner to provide funds to ""offset"" CO2 emissions. These programs are in contrast to efforts by certain states in the northeastern United States to regulate CO2 emissions on a regional level with a ""cap-and-trade"" regulatory scheme. Also, the state of Maine has passed a law that sets goals for greenhouse gas reductions across the transportation, commercial, industrial, government, and residential sectors, versus a focus on the power generation industry.

It treats the interaction of the plasma ions, atoms and of the impurities with the plasma facing components (PFC). ERO modelling for ITER estimates the lifetime of the inner target (erosion of 0.5 cm) to about 7000 shots with a shot length of 400s. The maximum allowed tritium retention due to eroded carbon not redeposited locally on the target plates would be already reached after 380-440 shots. Strike point sweeping might increase the target life time by a factor of about 4 while tritium retention seems not to be influenced. Apart from transient events especially material mixing effects of the elements foreseen for ITER as PFC (carbon, beryllium and tungsten) introduce uncertainties in the prediction. The injection of hydrocarbon (13CH4) through spherical shaped limiters (one made of tungsten, one of graphite) in TEXTOR reveal that carbon has a reduced deposition efficiency on tungsten compared to graphite. This effect has not been taken into account until now in the modelling by the ERO code. The surface model of the code has therefore been substituted by a customized version of the Monte Carlo Code SDTrimSP which will help to clarify the effects of material mixing. A first successful test simulation shows that the depth distributed concentration of PFC influences sputtering yields. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

In this concluding chapter, I explore beyond that boundary, and consider the implications of settlement options based on resource fluctuations in terms of their accessible distribution. Among the advantages of recognizing times when prehistoric options were limited in some ways while remaining abundant in others, is the opportunity to more accurately predict techno-environmental behaviors and how those behaviors might be reflected within geographic land use activity spheres. Building on the rich record at Page-Ladson which spans some six millennia of human prehistory from latest Pleistocene into early Holocene, I attempt more accurately to understand the constraints placed on populations who lived during the various late glacial and postglacial climatic intervals. This approach is based on presumed vital resource availability, but not all resources may have been vital or available. For example, potable water is a vital resource, but the fish that live in the water may not be a vital resource. Expending energy for fishing when surface water and fish are scarce is less efficient than the pursuit of other, more abundant sources of protein. Resources needed for maintenance and/or adapting a culture's techno-environmental repertoire of tools represent other candidates likely to be vital for continued exploitation during times of limited availability. In the Southeast, potable water is a vital resource of archaeological significance because its availability can expand or contract settlement options, particularly during the time of Paleoindian hunter-gatherer societies. A study investigating the influences of water availability on large mammal communities in the semi-arid savannahs of Africa, documents game animal dispersal patterns. ""The carrying capacity of the [East African savanna] country as a whole is closely related to the carrying capacity of land within 'cruising range' of the dry season water supplies"" (Lamprey, 1964). Three categories of large herbivores species are recognized: (1) migratory, (2) dispersal, and (3) resident. Migratory and dispersal species are waterdependent (obligatory drinkers) where as resident species are water-independent and can obtain sufficient moisture from the local browse they consume. The habits of dispersal species are worth considering here. During dry times, dispersal species gradually migrate into confined range areas surrounding water holes. Their range is therefore limited by potable water. Unless there is a mass die-off during extreme conditions, predators, including human hunters, are afforded the luxury of finding their prey confined in small range areas. Conversely, following rains and the onset of the wet seasons, game animals undertake a sudden migration, dispersing from water holes to occupy a much larger, unified range (Western, 1975). The late Pleistocene transgressions and regressions of inland water tables not only affected the availability of potable surface water, but also affected the availability of other resources. Protein resources are vital to humans and are likely to have varied through time in the proportion of upland, wetland, and underwater species exploited. Bone was another vital resource important to Paleoindian technology and was largely derived from the long bones and tusks of large Pleistocene mammals (Dunbar and Webb, 1996; Webb and Hemmings, 2001; Hemmings, 2004). The availability of lithic resources for stone tool manufacture varied inversely with that of potable water. When water tables were high, chert outcrops in lowland basins and channels were drowned and when the local water tables dropped many outcrops became exposed and were available for exploitation (Dunbar, 1981).",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890187252

In this paper, a unit-level data base of emissions by nearly 2000 electric generating units from 1985 through 2002 is used to analyze the contribution of these two factors in accomplishing the significant reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions from these sources in the United States. The effect on SO2 emissions of the new naturalgas-fired, combined-cycle capacity that has been introduced since 1998 is also examined. The results indicate that cleaning up the old plants has made by far the greatest contribution to reducing SO2 emissions, and that this contribution has been especially large since the introduction of the SO2 cap-and-trade program in 1995. The new natural-gas-fired, combined cycle units have displaced conventional generation that would have emitted about 800.000 tons of SO2; however, the effect has not been to reduce total SO2 emissions since the 9.0 million ton cap is unchanged, but to reduce the quantity of abatement required of other units in meeting the cap and thereby the cost of doing so. © 2006 Physica-Verlag Heidelberg.","clean aircraft; combined cycle generation; effectiveness of cleaning up vs. replacing; electricity generation; US SO2 emission reductions",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895259661

The SiGe substrates were fabricated with a thin buffer-layer scheme, using a carbon-doped layer to induce a high relaxation degree of the virtual substrate. Threading dislocations, carbon-induced defects, and residual implantation damage each have a distinct effect on the junction leakage, generation lifetime, and high-temperature behavior of the diodes. It is shown that threading dislocations degrade the junction quality at room temperature. However, the high-temperature behavior of these junctions is diffusion-dominated. When present in the depletion region, carbon-induced defects cause a large generation current inside the SiGe diodes, a behavior that is dominant in the full temperature range investigated (20° C< Tmeasure <250°C). Implantation damage influences the leakage in silicon junctions but is of minor importance in SiGe junctions with a large amount of threading dislocations or carbon-induced defects.

Deeper-water carbonates and silici - clastics accumulated to comparable thickness in the Nanpanjiang Basin southeast of the platform. After the demise of the platform, an additional 2500 m of mostly siliciclastics spread across the platform in Late Triassic. Deposition of platform carbonates was also widespread in the Permian of south China, but a transgression in perhaps the last 2 m.y. of the Permian combined with differential subsidence to reconfigure the Yangtze Platform in the Triassic. The margin retreated ∼100 km northward in the Guiyang (eastern) sector, and a low-relief ramp developed over the flat top of thePermian platform, whereas the Early Triassic margin mimicked the Permian location in the Zhenfeng sector to the southwest. Nevertheless, deposition was essentially continuous from the Permian into the Triassic in most localities in Guizhou. Triassic deposition began with widespread terrigenous mud bearing thin-shelled bivalves or ammonoids. Renewed carbonate deposition within the Induan produced thin-bedded, laminated, dark-gray lime mudstone with planktonic biota in the basin interspersed with carbonate breccias. Thin-bedded lime mudstones with prominent burrows formed farther updip to the north and west. Thick intervals of oolite and of shallow - water lime mudstone interbedded with terrigenous clastic wedges that thicken and merge to the west mark the updip limit of deposition on a carbonate ramp. Platform - interior carbonates are more than three times as thick as their basinal equivalents. The ramp configuration evolved into a flat-topped platform with a slight rim in the Olenekian, recorded by peritidal carbonate cycles at the platform margin and subtidal lagoonal muds and ultimately evaporites in the interior. Carbonate deposition spread farther westward to cover the terrigenous siliciclastics of the Induan. A major deepening event within the Olenekian is marked by black, ammonoid-bearing, nodular limestone and fissile shale. The patchy distribution of this facies indicates differential warping of the platform rather than purely eustatic causes. The basin received a starvation diet of siliciclastic and carbonate mud with minor silty turbidites and carbonate debris flows. At the end of Early Triassic, platform-interior deposits averaged 1175 m thick and basinal equivalents only 250 m. Acidic volcanic ash spread across the Yangtze Platform at the Olenekian-Anisian transition. Anisian deposits in the Nanpanjiang Basin are dominantly siliciclastics that thicken dramatically in southwestern Guizhou and adjacent Guangxi. Biogenic frame - stones constructed by organisms of questionable origins, Tubiphytes and Plexoramea, assisted by sponges, arborescent corals, skeletal stromatolites, and copious encrusters, rimmed the Anisian platform. This rim collapsed along most of the Guiyang sector to form a basin-margin wedge 175 km long deposited by turbidity currents, debris flows, and rock fall. Collapse led to retreat of the margin by ∼2.7 km; exceptionally by 10 km. In contrast the reef margin advanced slightly in parts of the Zhenfeng sector. Muddominated peritidal cycles formed in the lee of the reefs. Deposition in the platform interior was entirely subtidal with alternating episodes of normal marine water, hypersalinity, and siliciclastic influx. An increase in siliciclastic content eastward throughout the Middle Triassic signals the emergence of the Jiangnan Massif, which had been covered throughout the Permian and at least the Induan. Platform sedimentation in the Ladinian features peritidal cycles that extended far into the interior to define a flat - topped platform. High depositional energy is reflected in grainstones and packstones composed of grapestone, bioclasts, and ooids. Barriers other than sand shoals appear to have been absent. Biogenic facies are confined to small outcrops of Tubiphytes and coral boundstone, interpreted as patch reefs. Tepee structures cap many cycles or disrupt successive cycles, indicating extended subaerial exposure. At the beginning of the Ladinian, the platform margin of the Guiyang sector prograded at least 0.6 km. In the Zhenfeng sector the margin retreated slightly, further indication of more rapid subsidence of the western part of the platform. The Nanpanjiang Basin apparently starved early in the Ladinian, but filled to overflowing with siliciclastic turbidites and mud in the later Ladinian or the early Carnian. Transport direction of the very fine sand of the turbidites was from the east, pointing to the Jiangnan Massif as a continued source of sediment, both by land onto the platform and by sea into the basin. East and west sectors of the Yangtze Platform in Guizhou present stark contrasts during the Carnian and Norian. Shallow-water carbonate deposition continued into the Carnian in the Guiyang sector, but tongues of terrigenous mud and sand from the northeast reached to the platform margin and damped out carbonate deposition by the end of the Carnian. Erosion prevailed in the Norian, truncating formations toward the north down to the level of the Anisian. Shallow-water carbonate deposition ended dramatically with the beginning of the Carnian in the Zhenfeng sector. Nodular-bedded, dark-gray lime mudstone with ammonoids overlies peritidal deposits, documenting the drowning of the Yangtze Platform. A very condensed sequence of black shale with concentrations of manganese, reduced iron, and organic carbon followed. Siliciclastic flysch and shallow-water sandstone totaling 1265 m thick filled the accommodation space resulting from the drowning by the end of the Carnian. Norian deposits are cross-bedded sandstones and conglomerates that form thinning- and fining-upward cycles attributed to braided streams that encroached on coastal swamps represented by commercial coal and by mudrocks containing fresh-water, brackish, or marine fossils. The braided streams were rejuvenated and apparently reversed in the Rhaetian to form a coarse-grained clastic wedge that thins and fines toward the north and east across an erosion surface that cuts as deep as Anisian rocks in northern Guizhou. Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks overlie the Rhaetian rocks concordantly, contradicting prevalent interpretations of a major orogeny (Indosinian) in the Late Triassic in Guizhou. The angular unconformity underlying Upper Cretaceous conglomerates dates major deformation in Guizhou as mid-Cretaceous.

Several major utilities and developers recently announced plans to build IGCC plants and other major utilities are evaluating IGCC's suitability for base-load capacity additions. This recent surge of attention to IGCC power generation Is creating a growing demand for experience with the analysis, operation, and control of commercial-scale IGCC plants. To meet this need, the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) has launched a project to develop a generic, full-scope, IGCC dynamic plant simulator for use in establishing a state-ofthe-art simulator training center at West Virginia University's (WVU) National Research Center for Coal and Energy (NRCCE). The IGCC Dynamic Simulator & Training (DS&T) Center will be established under the auspices of the Collaboratory for Process & Dynamic Systems Modeling (""Collaboratory"") organized between NETL, WVU, the University of Pittsburgh, and Carnegie Mellon University. In a recently completed scoping study, the authors defined the requirements and features for an IGCC simulator, and identified potential operator training simulator (OTS) suppliers, R&D technology collaborators, and members of an industry experts group for the project. Key simulator requirements and features identified included: High-fidelity, real-time dynamic models of both process (gasification) and power sides Full-scope OTS capabilities including startup, shutdown, load following and shedding, response to fuel and ambient variations, control strategy analysis, malfunctions/trips, alarms, scenarios, trending and snapshots Unified software modeling platform for engineering analysis and training Maintainable, flexible, extendable and easy-to-use software and model libraries Full distributed control system (DCS) emulation Leverage existing NETL equipment/process models and software technology Extendable to FutureGen and zero-emission poly-generation plants The project consists of five phases including: I) Project scoping, II) Detailed planning, III) Simulator development, IV) Simulator deployment, and V) Establishment and support of an IGCC Dynamic Simulator & Training DS&T Center. The project length from simulator planning through deployment is about three years. The IGCC DS&T Center will offer much-needed demonstration, education, and training services such as IGCC plant operation and control demonstrations, technology familiarization, computer-based training and on-site ""train the trainer"" programs. Potential users include utilities, engineering firms, technology suppliers, Department of Energy system analysts and engineers, university engineering and training R&D community, and others interested in learning more about IGCC plant operations and control. Because the simulator will be based on a generic IGCC plant design, it Is not intended for training actual plant operators, but IGCC operators may benefit from training on the generic simulator before moving on to plant-specific simulators. The IGCC Dynamic Simulator & Training Center project will build on and reach beyond existing combined-cycle and conventional-coal power plant simulators to combine for the first time a ""process/gasification"" simulator and a ""combined-cycle"" simulator together in a single dynamic simulator framework for use in training applications as well as engineering studies.",,"Coal combustion; Computer simulation; Dynamic analysis; Energy efficiency; Gasification; Base-load capacity additions; Commercial-scale IGCC plants; Power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748905599

All are consumable and their availability influences the structure and composition of the whole ecosystem. Nutrients may play an important role in the competition between algae or cyanobacteria directly adjacent to each other (Keating, 1999) and in the composition and succession of phytoplankton communities (Keating, 1977, 1978). CO2 is often limited in macrophyte stands due to high photosynthetic activity and due to its extremely reduced diffusion in water. Among all resources, light is the most important one because all photoautotrophs depend on it. The growth of submersed macrophytes for example is mainly limited by the availability of light (Phillips et al. 1978) and not by nutrients, since macrophytes obtain their major nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) mainly from the (nutrient rich) sediments (Bristow and Whitcombe, 1971; Toetz, 1974; Carignan and Kalff, 1980)1. Light is always reduced under water and can not be substituted. This means that it can not be replaced by another resource, as it is the case for e.g., CO2, which can be replaced through HCO3- by some plants, like Elodea and Hydrilla, when it becomes limited. Light can furthermore not be stored (like some algae and cyanobacteria can store phosphorus) and used when it is not present in the surrounding water. Light conditions under water are very peculiar and differ extremely from those ashore. First, the intensity of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) decreases exponentially with increasing water depth. This is a normal process and means that light conditions at low depths are already significantly worse than on the water surface, even in clear water bodies. Besides this reduction in light quantity, also light quality (i.e. the wavelength) changes. Both phenomena lead to a vertical zonation and many submersed photoautotrophs have thus evolved morphological and physiological adaptations to low light conditions. Algae and cyanobacteria bear special pigments; typical adaptations in macrophytes are finely dissected leaves, a thin cuticle or an increased number of chloroplasts in the epidermal layer. Low light compensation points and/or low respiration rates permit an efficient photosynthesis at only 1 to 3% of the surface irradiation (Wetzel, 2001). However, these adaptations may not be sufficient when light is further reduced by its consumption through competing photoautotrophs. Light competition may have severe, negative consequences for submersed living primary producers. Phytoplankton in the water column and epiphytes on the leaves of macrophytes further reduce the inherently low light conditions under water. The decrease of the macrophyte Potamogeton filiformis in Loch Leven during the summer months has been traced back to the high phytoplankton abundance in this lake (Jupp and Spence, 1977). In fact, phytoplankton at its maximum density can cause up to 70% of the vertical light attenuation (Tilzer, 1983). Lemnids that freely float on the water surface cause immense shading of the vegetation below and according to Den Hartog and Van der Velde (1988), only few plants (Potamogeton pectinatus, Elodea nuttallii, Ceratophyllum and Utricularia) are able to tolerate this situation for a considerable time. Epiphytes can account for up to 86% of the total light attenuation (Sand-Jensen and Sndergaard, 1981) und thus cause light limitation for underwater vegetation. To prevent this limitation and their detrimental consequences, adaptations beyond low light adaptation are necessary. Fast growth, as observed for the eelgrass Zostera marina, is a counteracting strategy to avoid light limitation. The leaves of Z. marina grow up to 6 cm per day and remain uncovered for nearly one week which enables maximum photosynthetic activity (Wium-Andersen and Borum, 1980). Several plants form so called canopies that lead to severe shading of phytoplankton, competing plants and benthic algae and cyanobacteria (Barko and Smart, 1981). However, canopy formation is not only induced by low light intensities but also by an increase in water temperature. A powerful strategy against competing primary producers is the secretion of chemicals that inhibit growth of algae, cyanobacteria or higher plants. Whereas fast growth should only be possible at excellent conditions, allelopathy could act alternatively or at least supplementary (Wium-Andersen, 1987). Allelopathy in aquatic systems Although from this background allelopathy should be considered important in aquatic ecosystems, it has been neglected for long time. However, hints for allelopathic interactions between aquatic organisms exist for nearly 100 years and at the beginning, mostly autotoxic interactions were described. The first report of biochemical interactions between aquatic primary producers was that of Harder (1917) who noticed a putative negative interaction between cells of the blue-green alga, Nostoc punctiforme. Similar observations of autoinhibition were made with Chlorella cultures (Pratt and Fong, 1940). During that time also negative relations between submersed macrophytes and phytoplankton were observed (Schreiter, 1928; cited in Rice, 1984). This was confirmed by the mesocosm experiments performed by (Hasler and Jones, 1949) who noticed, that ponds containing Elodea plants had lower phytoplankton densities than ponds without the plants. Low phytoplankton densities are often found in lakes dominated by macrophytic vegetation (Jeppesen, 1998; Wetzel, 2001), not only by Elodea, and some plants are less covered with epiphytes than others (Wium-Andersen, 1987). In recent years, aquatic allelopathy has attracted more and more attention among scientists which is reflected by the increasing number of articles that review or at least mention allelopathy in the different types of micro- and macrophytes present in aquatic systems (e.g., Rice, 1984; Gopal and Goel, 1993; Inderjit and Dakshini, 1994; Elakovich and Wooten, 1995; Gross, 1999; Neori et al. 2000; Gross, 2003). Allelopathy is now even subject in ecological and mathematical models (Scheffer et al. 1993; Mukhopadhyay et al. 1998). However, the reason for this raise in attention might be the possible application of allelopathic plants or allelochemicals in the control of undesired weeds and algal blooms. Accordingly, a lot of aquatic primary producers have yet been investigated for their allelopathic potential and many were found to be allelopathically active. The trend is thereby shifting from descriptive studies (e.g., Hasler and Jones, 1949; McNaughton, 1968; Fitzgerald, 1969) to analytical studies that focus on the isolation and identification of active compounds (e.g., Della Greca et al. 1989; Aliotta et al. 1991; Aliotta et al. 1992). Allelochemicals are identified for some algae and macrophytes and they exhibit a broad spectrum of different chemical characteristics. Among them are sulfur compounds, fatty acid derivatives, polyacetylenes and polyphenols (summarized in Gross, 1999). Since allelopathy studies might become more frequent in the future, it is likely that more types of allelopathically active secondary metabolites will be discovered. The intention of this article is to give an overview on the current knowledge on allelopathy in freshwater ecosystems with focus on submersed macrophytes-and to discuss it under an ecological point of view. Furthermore, other possible functions of plant secondary metabolites besides allelopathic effects are presented. © 2006 Springer.

The European Community and the industry have set a number of very ambitious objectives, to be fulfilled by 2020. In order to achieve the 3 main objectives of reducing the emissions of CO2, NOX and noise, while reducing costs, Snecma develops several technologies in the short - medium - and the long-term. The emissions of CO2, and hence consumptions, will be reduced through ever higher dilution rates. This is made possible with lighter technologies, and particularly with composite materials: woven structural materials for FAN blades and the cold parts of the engine, ceramic matrix composite materials for hot parts of the engine and metallic titanium matrix composite materials for compressors. The emissions of NOX will first be reduced with Lean Premixed concentric-staged injection, and then with Lean Premixed Prevaporized injections, when combustor operability issues will have been settled. The noise will be reduced naturally as the dilution rates increase and also with betteroptimized shapes, using new acoustic methods. But to go further, it might be useful to use new architectures at engine level, like the Contrarotating FAN, and/or new positions of engines on the aircraft. Acoustic control - in terms of prediction using better calculation codes and of attenuation using active devices - certainly is an area for research on which efforts should be focus. Snecma is preparing all these new concepts and new technologies under a number of in house and national programs and within the European frame work programs, in particular with SILENCER, VITAL and NEWAC. With all this R&T investment, major progress will be achieved on aircraft engines in terms of the emissions of CO2, NOX and noise, in line with the Vision for 2020.",,"Aerospace industry; Carbon dioxide; Civil aviation; Composite materials; Cost reduction; Nitrogen oxides; Sustainable development; Acoustic control; Acoustic methods; Betteroptimized shapes; Dilution rates; Air transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249281626

Portugal is not an exception. However, the need for economic development and an higher quality of life induced more energy consumption and increasing the GGE. Transportation economic sector will be, at 2010, the most important GGE responsible in Portugal, representing 29.0 % of all CO2 emissions. The main fraction of those emissions, 84.6 %, corresponds to road transport activity. Paper demonstrates that the implementation of alternative vehicle drivetrains, like HEV and PHEV, in the Portuguese automobile fleet could be a credible solution to the needed GGE reduction and can also contribute for attenuating the imported energy dependency of Portugal.

Many mobile applications have been successfully addressed with passively regenerating wall flow filters. However stationary engines, locomotives and other large constant speed engines often require a different approach to particulate filtration. Flow-through filter technologies have merit for these applications due to their low maintenance requirements, tolerance to misfueling and suitability for engines with high specific PM emissions. When considering the application of a particulate filter to any diesel engine the means of regeneration, or combustion of the accumulated soot, is of critical importance. In the case of filters which are regenerated through the use of a catalytic coating the duty cycle of the engine, and characteristics of the exhaust gas itself dictate the potential success or failure of the system. In many cases interruption of operation, whether due to insufficient regeneration rates, or for scheduled service to remove accumulated ash, is relatively more difficult to accept for locomotive and non-mobile engine operations. Locomotives, power generators and the like often accumulate large number of service hours between scheduled maintenance events and perform tasks where interruption of service can have costly consequences. Details of an investigation into the suitability of a flow-through filter for heavy-duty constant speed engines are presented. Aspects of the design, including materials selection, catalyst coating and performance under various conditions are discussed. Results from CFD and micro-dilution tunnel particulate sampling of full-scale devices support the progressive refinement of the design.

Multibeam bathymetry reveals two prominent, northeast trending ridges, parallel to subduction along the margin, that are steep sided and extensively slumped. Elevated concentrations of methane (up to 10 nM, 10× background) within the water column are associated with a slump structure at the southern end of Eastern Rock Garden. The anomalous methane concentrations were detected by a methane sensor (METS) attached to a conductivity-temperature-depth-optical backscatter device (CTDO) and are associated with elevated light scattering and flare-shaped backscatter signals revealed by the ship's echo sounder. Increased particulate matter in the water column, possibly related to the seepage and/or higher rates of erosion near slump structures, is considered to be the cause of the increased light scattering, rather than bubbles in the water column. Methane concentrations calculated from the METS are in good agreement with concentrations measured by gas chromatography in water samples collected at the same time. However, there is a c. 20 min (c. 900 m) delay in the METS signal reaching maximum CH4 concentrations. The maximum methane concentration occurs near the plateau of Eastern Rock Garden close to the edge of a slump, at 610 m below sea level (mbsl). This is close to the depth (c. 630 mbsl) where a bottom simulating reflector (BSR) pinches out at the seafloor. Fluctuating water temperatures observed in previous studies indicate that the stability zone for pure methane hydrate in the ocean varies between 630 and 710 mbsl. However, based on calculations of the geothermal gradients from BSRs, we suggest gas hydrate in the study area to be more stable than hydrate from pure methane in sea water, moving the phase boundary in the ocean upward. Small fractions of additional higher order hydrocarbon gases are the most likely cause for increased hydrate stability. Relatively high methane concentrations have been measured down to c. 1000 mbsl, most likely in response to sediment slumping caused by gas hydrate destabilisation of the sediments and/or marking seepage through the gas hydrate zone. © 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Hikurangi margin; Hydrate; Methane; Multibeam bathymetry; Ritchie Ridge; Slumping","bathymetric survey; continental margin; gas hydrate; gas seepage; methane; mid-ocean ridge; slumping; subduction; Hikurangi Margin; Pacific Ocean; Ritchie Ridge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846366423

In the United States, coal-fired power plants emit about 48 tons of mercury and are the largest point source of emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency determined the need to control mercury emissions from power plants and issued regulations on March 15, 2005 under the Clean Air Mercury Rule. In addition, several states have proposed mercury regulations more aggressive than the Federal rule. Recognizing the potential for mercury regulations, the U.S. Department of Energy/National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE/NETL) has been carrying out a comprehensive mercury research and development program since the early 1990s. Working collaboratively with EPRI, industry, academia, and EPA, DOE/NETL has helped to advance the understanding of the formation, distribution, and capture of mercury. However, uncertainty remains, particularly related to the overall cost and effectiveness of controlling mercury from a diverse population of coal-fired boilers, as well as the ultimate fate of mercury once it is removed from the flue gas. This presentation will provide an update on DOE/NETL s Phase II mercury field testing program directed at full-scale and slip-stream evaluation of sorbent injection (e.g., activated carbon) and oxidation processes that have the capability to achieve 50 to 70 percent capture of mercury from operating pulverized-coal-fired power plants.

The aim of the study was to delineate highly contaminated areas and to discriminate them from areas relatively unaffected by this source. An enhancement in the concentration of magnetic particles in topsoil through this area has been observed. This fact is originated by anthropogenic magnetite transported through the atmosphere in a form of a plume which travels down-wind along the valley of the Llobregat River.

One of the most important, but often neglected, issues which needs to be addressed in this ongoing discussion concerns the relationship between emission (noise source) and immission (noise receiver) noise policy concepts. Some of the initial approaches being proposed for a Global Noise Policy focus predominantly on noise emission policy concepts and incorrectly minimize or ignore the important role of the noise immission approach. This is particularly true for the combined noise environment because people in communities around the world are almost always exposed to noise from multiple, combined noise sources. Although it is true that control of noise at the source should continue to be the primary approach for minimizing exposure to workplace, community and broader environmental noises, this paper argues for a more balanced and integrated approach between noise emission and noise immission concepts and tools. Specifically, land use planning and the environmental noise impact analysis and mitigation process are crucial to controlling and managing the global noise environment in the future.

Some features, such as greater technological detail, seem less significant. Understanding the importance of key modeling assumptions, as well as the way the models are used to estimate abatement costs, can help guide the development of consistent modeling practices for policy evaluation.

The Turlock Irrigation District Almond Power plant had recently installed an upgraded gas turbine (GT), and replaced both CO oxidation and selective catalytic control (SCR) NOx control catalysts in order to withstand the higher exhaust temperatures of the new gas turbine. After the retrofits, both NOx and CO emissions were within Permitted limits, but were above expected values, and operators found that overspray of ammonia was required to meet required NOx values of 3.0 ppmv at 15% O2. The need to overspray also resulted in unacceptably high levels of ammonia slip at the stack. Following investigations which included physical flow modeling of the ductwork, TID opted to have the exhaust gas flow numerically modeled to confirm the origin of the emissions problem and identify and implement a long-term resolution. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses confirmed that the cause of the poor emissions performance was highly biased gas flow distributions at the entrance to the CO catalyst modules and the ammonia injection grid (AIG). Using multiple models to evaluate alternate configurations of flow control devices, a single distribution grid located upstream of the CO catalyst modules was designed to provide improved flow distributions at both the CO catalyst, AIG, and SCR catalysts. Field tests of the plant with the installed distribution grid confirmed that the retrofit significantly improved emissions performance while reducing both required ammonia injection flows and ammonia slip values eight-fold. This not only allowed the plant to meet and exceed required emissions levels, but also reduced ammonia injection flow rates by a minimum of 40%. Additionally, the facility has seen an improvement in the plant's effective operating range. This is the range at which the plant can operate and still maintain emissions compliance. Prior to the installation of the distribution grid the plant had an effective operating range of 30 - 50 MW. The plant now has an effective operating range of 20 - 50 MW. This is beneficial at times when the plant is operated in ""load following"" mode.

As the power generation industry continues to adjust, an unprecedented number of coal-fired powerplants (assets) and ownership positions will change hands over the next several years. Both prospective buyers and sellers seek to fully understand all economic risks to the financial proforma of the asset. Caution - the term Environmental Due Diligence means different things to different people. Traditional due diligence services have focused on historical and existing conditions. In practice, few material ""surprises"" emerge from these reviews - the issues typically have been studied for years and are well documented. Similarly, an EHS compliance audit only documents existing management practices, unlikely to identify material issues that can not be easily corrected. The single largest risk to a coal-fired powerplant is the potential impact of new and emerging future regulatory initiatives. These issues drive the entire valuation of the asset. The ""Coal Asset Environmental Survey"" is a forward looking environmental due diligence assessment, that seeks to characterize potential capital and operating cost impacts of new and emerging environmental initiatives including multi-pollutant legislation, mercury control, NSR reform, 316 (a) and (b), PM 2.5, BART and greenhouse gas regulations. At a minimum, a given coal asset may be faced with conversion to PRB, addition of active mercury control and annual purchase of emission credits. In the extreme, some facilities may require an entire new APC train or even replacement of older, smaller boilers with a new state-of-the-art supercritical PC Unit or CFBs.

The invasion of European earthworms into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests of North America dominated by Acer, Quercus, Betula, Pinus and Populus has provided ample opportunity to observe how earthworms engineer ecosystems. Impacts vary with soil parent material, land use history, and assemblage of invading earthworm species. Earthworms reduce the thickness of organic layers, increase the bulk density of soils and incorporate litter and humus materials into deeper horizons of the soil profile, thereby affecting the whole soil food web and the above ground plant community. Mixing of organic and mineral materials turns mor into mull humus which significantly changes the distribution and community composition of the soil microflora and seedbed conditions for vascular plants. In some forests earthworm invasion leads to reduced availability and increased leaching of N and P in soil horizons where most fine roots are concentrated. Earthworms can contribute to a forest decline syndrome, and forest herbs in the genera Aralia, Botrychium, Osmorhiza, Trillium, Uvularia, and Viola are reduced in abundance during earthworm invasion. The degree of plant recovery after invasion varies greatly among sites and depends on complex interactions with soil processes and herbivores. These changes are likely to alter competitive relationships among plant species, possibly facilitating invasion of exotic plant species such as Rhamnus cathartica into North American forests, leading to as yet unknown changes in successional trajectory. © 2006 Springer.","Aporrectodea; Dendrobaena; Exotic earthworm invasion; Keystone species; Lumbricus rubellus; Lumbricus terrestris; Minnesota forests; New York forests",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900584031

As a result, fuel cell technology is now moving from a laboratory existence to niche markets for near-term commercial applications. Light urban buses are an interesting early application of fuel cells. Today, several hundred battery-powered light urban buses operate in European communities to reduce harmful emissions typically associated with the operation of diesel buses. Using batteries to power these electric vehicles offers many strengths, however their excessive weight and size leads to certain disadvantages such as restricted payloads and operating ranges. Over the course of nine months in 2004, Hydrogenics converted a mid-size battery-powered bus to a Fuel Cell Hybrid Midibus (FCH Midibus). The aim of the project, enabled through an investment from the European Union (EU) and the State of North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW), Germany, was to develop a bus to demonstrate and advance commercialization of fuel cell transportation to benefit European cities. The resulting hybrid power train, based on hydrogen fuel cells as the energy conversion component and batteries as a source of temporary electrical storage, significantly reduced the weight of the overall power train and as much as tripled the bus's range, making it an attractive alternative for transit operators. The Midibus was first road tested in July, 2005 and received full road approvals in November, 2005. The paper discusses the general design concept of the fuel cell hybrid power train of the FCH Midibus and the resulting performance of the bus in the field. © EVS-22 Yokohama, Japan.",,"Commercial applications; European community; Fuel cell system; Fuel cell technologies; Harmful emissions; Niche applications; Operating ranges; Transit operators; Buses; Electric vehicles; Energy conversion; Hybrid powertrains; Roads and streets; Fuel cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880464951

Two sets of samples were collected in 2001 (winter and summer campaigns) in representative zones of an industrial city of Argentina. The leaching scheme was applied to PM-10 particles and consisted in extracting the elements in four fractions, namely soluble and exchangeable elements; carbonates, oxides and reducible elements; bound to organic matter and sulfidic metals; and residual elements. Metals and metalloids at μg g-1 level were determined in each fraction by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). Analyte concentration varied from 14 μg g-1 (equivalent to 1.0 ng m-3) for As to 11.8 mg g-1 (equivalent to 2089 ng m-3) for Al. Seven elements, namely Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Pb, Ti and Zn showed similar distributions in both seasons while As was distributed in a significantly different manner in each season. The results exhibited low As contents in the first and second fractions that could be associated with routine coal combustion and a high content in the third and fourth fractions of the summer samples that could be linked to the use of pesticides. Aluminium, As, Cu, Mn, Ni, Ti, V and Zn were found in different percentages in the more bioavailable aqueous fraction with As, Mn, V and Zn exhibiting solubilities greater than 1% while Cr and Pb being insoluble. The content of Al, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the residual fraction was, in average, higher than 50%. A comparative assessment of the use of the underlying information available from fractionation studies compared to that obtained from total element content was done for Fe and Mn. It showed that the results obtained using chemical sequential extraction procedures allowed further discrimination of the potential air pollution sources. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006.",,"aluminum; arsenic; carbonic acid derivative; chromium; copper; glass fiber; iron; magnesium; manganese; metal; oxide; thallium; zinc; air pollution; airborne particle; Argentina; article; chemical binding; fractionation; nonhuman; priority journal; spectrometry; Air Pollutants; Argentina; Chemical Fractionation; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Industry; Metals, Heavy; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Solubility; Trace Elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748304356

Environmental financial markets in 2005 are accelerating their market maturation process for SO2, NOX, and carbon dioxide. They are also being driven by regulatory changes, increased coal burning, higher prices and more volatility for fossil fuels, and a knock effect from the launch of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for carbon dioxide and the five other greenhouse gases.

In other words, the basic principles of bio-climatic architecture are also used for work in city centres, whereby the architects who design the houses are expected to pay more attention to the microclimate and use local materials, rather than create identical buildings for all climates and latitudes using artificial conditioning/heating systems that cause pollution to ensure the comfort of indoor environments. The most cost-effective technological options for the civil sector to help reduce CO 2 emissions between now and 2020 in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol are passive solar systems, thermal insulation for buildings, high-efficiency heating systems, etc. A large number of ""historical"" buildings comprise materials with a high level of thermal inertia, internal courtyards and staircases that provide natural ventilation, windows orientated in accordance with the direction of winds that prevail in that particular microclimate and comfortable outdoor spaces such as porticos, etc. A large number of buildings lead to teleheating which consequently leads to large savings in primary energy, especially when combined with the co-generation of heat and electricity. The need to use traditional materials, to be aware of the techniques used to create ""historical"" buildings and to respect historical and artistic materials requires particular expertise and training courses to create the specialists.

The trapping may occur at channel margins, onlap surfaces and when turbidite sandbodies exhibit lateral variations in sand quality and/or bed thickness. The range of geometries occurring at these sandbody terminations has been the subject of detailed previous research and a number of classification schemes have been proposed. A single classification scheme, based only on the geometry of the sandbody and individual sandstone beds, is proposed here. The different geometries of sandbody termination or pinchout will have an impact on both the static and dynamic behaviour of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Dynamic simulation of a range of models of sandbody pinchout by onlap indicates that the recovery factor of stratigraphically trapped fields will be influenced by a range of geological and engineering parameters. Producing wells positioned too far from the sandbody termination run the risk of leaving behind significant volumes of up-dip oil. If wells are moved closer to the sandbody termination, they may intersect the onlap surface, and so not penetrate the lowest sandstone beds. In systems with a low effective vertical permeability, oil from these lower beds may not be efficiently produced. In this case, the optimum well location, in terms of recovery factor, is close to the initiation of onlap. Unfortunately, this position may be difficult to identify in the subsurface without the drilling of many appraisal wells. Variation in a range of parameters has been modelled, in order to examine their impact on hydrocarbon recovery. For layered sand/shale successions, with low effective vertical permeability, the initiation of onlap, and therefore the optimum well location, moves further from the onlap termination as the angle of onlap decreases. The maximum recovery factor is also lower for the lower onlap dips, as a greater volume of the reservoir lies up-dip of the producer at its optimum location. If individual sandstone beds thin towards the onlap, the volume of oil which might be left up-dip of producing wells is reduced, so that the risk in placing a well away from the sandbody termination is lower. The degree of trapping of hydrocarbons in the lower layers, as the producing well location moves onto the onlap surface, depends on the effective vertical permeability of the sandbody. If the vertical permeability is zero (as would be the case for a perfectly layered system with continuous sealing shales) no oil will be produced from the lower layers. As the vertical permeability is increased, fluids are able to flow vertically from these beds into higher beds and thence to the producer. The trapping potential is significantly reduced for kv:kh ratios of 2 × 10-5 or more, which is equivalent to an effective kv of 0.01 mD for a kh of 500 mD. In layered turbidites, this effective kv could be produced by 2 m thick sandstone beds, with a kv of 400 mD, interbedded with thin, non-sealing siltstones or silty shales, with permeabilities of the order of 10-4 mD. In practice, the effective kv:kh ratio of interbedded turbidite sandstones and shales is greatly influenced by the local erosion of the shales. Flow simulation through models representing various proportions of shale removal indicates that significant trapping of hydrocarbons in the lower layers may occur for proportions of shale removal below 15%. Above this value of shale removal, little trapping occurs, as fluids are able to move sufficiently easily between the individual sandstone layers. These results suggest that the risk of reduced hydrocarbon recovery, as producing wells are moved closer to the onlap termination, are significant only in the case of well-layered reservoirs with low proportions of shale removal and sand-bed amalgamation. Examination of available core should enable the proportion of bed amalgamation, and therefore the risk of reduced recovery, to be evaluated for a stratigraphically trapped reservoir of this type. © The Geological Society of London 2006.",,"hydrocarbon reserve; hydrocarbon reservoir; sand; stratigraphy; trap (geological structure); turbidite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646564391

Another critical point is that mixing and combustion should be sufficiently fast in order to avoid long combustion chamber caused by supersonic internal flow and short residence time. Cryogenic fuels are a logical choice but their lack of storability and low density make them second choice compared to liquid hydrocarbons for small vehicle application. Researches are currently conducted in order to optimize the cooling by the endothermic thermal decomposition of the fuel itself circulating trough the engine. The other benefit of this decomposition is the expected shift in the fuel mole fraction, from heavy hydrocarbons (with long induction delays), to light species (mainly H2, CH4 and C 2H4). MBDA-F launched with Orleans University a collaborative project named COMPARER, focusing on system analysis to identify one or two characteristic parameters (able to be measured) needed to understand and control the complex phenomena involved in the presented cooling technology and to evaluate some associated sensors. COMPARER is the French acronym for ""COntrol and Measure of PArameters in a REacting stReam"". The aim of this project is to identify one or two characteristic parameters (able to be measured) needed to understand and control the complex phenomena involved in the presented cooling technology and to evaluate some associated sensors. Computations are first performed, leading to the design of a specific well-documented test bench where the ""innovative"" techniques will be tested in an realistic environment in steady state and in unsteady computations. Many measurements techniques to be applied to measure the decomposed fuel features in flight were scanned, on the principle basis, then with the help of existing numerical simulations and models (NANCY, CHEMKIN, HITRAN, ...). A specific test bench has been designed, with some characterization methods (not to be used in flight) on another hand and a place to test ""COMPARER"" systems planned to be possibly used in flight for actual regulation of a hydrocarbon-fuel-regeneratively-cooled engine. The paper shows results obtained at this test bench up to full C12H26 decomposition up to 6 MPa pressure as well as three examples of possible ""simple"" measurement techniques to be used on an actual system.",,"Combustion optimization; Fuel reforming; Scramjet; Aircraft fuels; Combustion; Optimization; Project management; Temperature control; Thermal load; Reforming reactions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947224080

We apply a 3-D chemical transport model that includes comprehensive chemistry for both the troposphere and the stratosphere and uses various aircraft emission scenarios developed during TRADEOFF for the year 2000. The environmental effects of enhanced air traffic along polar routes and of possible changes in cruising altitude are investigated, taking into account effects of flight route changes on fuel consumption and emissions. In a reference case including both civil and military aircraft the model predicts aircraft-induced maximum increases of zonal-mean NOy (=total reactive nitrogen) between 156 pptv (August) and 322 pptv (May) in the tropopause region of the Northern Hemisphere. Resulting maximum increases in zonal-mean ozone vary between 3.1 ppbv in September and 7.7 ppbv in June. Enhanced use of polar routes implies substantially larger zonal-mean ozone increases in high Northern latitudes during summer, while the effect is negligible in winter. Lowering the flight altitude leads to smaller ozone increases in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere, and to larger ozone increases at altitudes below. Regarding total ozone change, the degree of cancellation between these two effects depends on latitude and season, but annually and globally averaged the contribution from higher altitudes dominates, mainly due to washout of NOy in the troposphere, which weakens the tropospheric increase. Raising flight altitudes increases the ozone burden both in the troposphere and the lower stratosphere, primarily due to a more efficient accumulation of pollutants in the stratosphere.",,"air traffic control; aircraft emission; chemical composition; environmental effect; fuel consumption; nitrous oxide; Northern Hemisphere; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746874138

These Power-Spar™ systems are capable of economically displacing up to 70% of the thermal requirements for most Canadian building envelopes. The Power-Spar also uses high efficiency photovoltaic cells positioned inside the system's concentrated light zone to co-produce electricity as well as heat at a fraction of the cost per watt when compared to conventional one sun photovoltaic modules. Because concentrators have a small heat loss area compared to a large optical capture area, systems such as the Power-Spar experience only a fraction of the winter heat loss when compared to other solar thermal systems presently on the market. This means that concentrators are ideally suited to cost-effectively provide a large fraction of the total building energy requirement directly from the sun. This efficient thermal capture in northern climates combined with low-cost electricity production make the concentrator a system worthy of study from a Canadian perspective. Approximately 80% of residential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions come from space and domestic hot water heating. For an average Canadian household, this portion of GHG emission totals to approximate 5.87 tonnes of GHG per year. If this technology becomes commercialized, the GHG emissions reduction realized in residential, commercial and industrial sectors, could be an important contribution towards helping Canada reach its national GHG emissions reduction target. Applied to the average home for space and domestic hot water heating, approximately 4.1 tonnes of GHG emissions reduction could be achieved annually. Together, the solar systems installed under this project will reduce GHG emissions by approximately 0.5 kT annually. If the technology achieves the market acceptance projected by the proponent, the total annual GHG emissions reductions will be 3800 kT by 2012.

By the 1980s, western water law seemed outmoded, and states promised reform to satisfy changing public demands and values. The 1990s brought change, but it came largely through initiatives of the federal government and local communities. Meanwhile, state water law and policy evolved haltingly at best. During the last quarter of the twentieth century, urbanization and society's aroused environmental consciousness put new demands on an old, unyielding system. The water distribution regime was dominated by unadorned notions of legal rights rooted in prior appropriation and by physical facilities, consisting mostly of federal dams and reservoirs, astride the West's waterways. These utilitarian laws and water projects left a legacy of environ-mental insult, and their inertia impeded dynamic new expressions of public values. New attempts by water developers to meet expanding demand were continually frustrated as they collided with a suite of federal environmental protection legislation passed in the 1970s. When federal subsidies for water projects collapsed in response to public sentiment and economic constraints, the states met change with outrage, arguing that the dual impediments of regulation and a shift away from subsidized development undermined their control over their future. Some leaders in the West called for the states to take a pivotal role in responding to emerging public values concerning water. This was a bright new recognition of how the West was changing and how the response of states must change, as well as an attempt to prevent federal domination. The agenda for a new western water policy included greater efficiency and conservation, conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water, protection of stream flows, more comprehensive planning, and inclusive public participation at the level closest to the resource. This chapter surveys the developments in state water law and policy during the 1990s. Although significant changes have occurred in the way important water decisions were made, the most impressive innovations were largely the products of federal regulatory pressure and flexibility and of locally based problem-solving efforts. The past teaches us that state water law furnished an administrative framework with little consciously articulated policy; the framework yielded whenever there was a promise of federal largess. Western water law and policy are likely to evolve further in response to new public demands. Major stresses on the system-demographics, competing policy demands, climate variability or change-will create crises. Experts, including state officials, may use nontraditional, place-specific problem-solving efforts as laboratories for incubating systemic reform. © 2003 by the University Press of Colorado.

Variables included age, gender, number and type of operations, visual acuity before and after the procedures and surgical success rate. Results: Overall, 28 eyes of 27 patients (26 female and one male) with mean age of 59.8±11 years were included. Mean follow-up was 17.3 (range 3-72) months. Mean axial length was 29±2.74mm (range: 24 to 35mm) and mean degree of myopia was -16.4±3.1 D (range -10 to -22 D). Posterior staphyloma was present in 20 eyes (71%).

For the first time we have analyzed the in situ carbon by a suite of micro-analytical techniques in order to identify and characterize the reduced carbonaceous matter. Optical analysis of the Nakhla perographicthin-section revealed the existence of a dark brown/red vein-filling material appearing as a series of bifurcating intrusions into a fine (<300 nm width) crack / fissure system within an olivine/augite groundmass. Micro-analytical analyses utilizing Focus Ion Beam (FIB) extraction techniques, FESEM/EDX, STEM/EDX, NanoSIMS Ion Microprobe, Laser Raman Spectroscopy, Stepped-Combustion Isotopic Mass Spectrometry have been utilized. The structure of the carbonaceous phase in Nakhla indicates it could not have been introduced allochthonously in its current physical form. The close association to a region of secondary mineralization (i.e., iddingsite) implies, although certainly does not confirm, a connection with the period of Martian aqueous alteration experienced by the rock. This carbonaceous material has similarities to macromolecular carbonaceous matter and yet possesses a complex structural and textural morphology that is not observed in carbonaceous or ordinary chondrite meteoritic kerogen. One of the possible origins for the carbonaceous matter is from biogenic processes operating on Mars.","Indigenous carbonaceous matter; Martian meteorite; Nakhla","Indigenous carbonaceous matters; Indigenous reduced carbon; Martian meteorites; Carbon; Macromolecules; Minerals; Optical systems; Raman spectroscopy; Rocks; Martian surface analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750717281

Rapid data acquisition of photoluminescence is made possible with a specially configured spectrofluorometer which uses a liquid nitrogen-cooled InGaAs array detector, imaging spectrograph, excitation reference photodiode and tunable xenon excitation source to collect seamless, instrument-corrected, excitation-emission quantum maps. The preferred instrument configuration with the InGaAs array can generate a quantum map with both high S/N levels and spectral resolution in only seconds to minutes; previous single-channel InGaAs photodiode and photomultiplier detector measurements took hours to days. The standard spectral range for excitation and emission is from 250 nm to 1700 nm with an option to extend to 2200 nm. Robust analysis of the quantum maps is facilitated by a custom global analysis program (US Patent Pending) which incorporates a powerful 'double-convolution integral' DCI algorithm to simultaneously model the excitation and emission spectral bands for each SWNT species. The patented DCI algorithm reduces the number of free fitting parameters for the spectral simulation by up to a factor of 1000 compared to conventional 2 D spectral simulators. The global analysis yields quantitative information on the chirality and diameter parameters of SWNT species in a given mixture. Together the acquisition hardware and analysis software constitute significant developments with respect to enhanced sensitivity and statistical significance for quantifying the components of complex SWNT mixtures. Raman maps of SWNTs were collected from dispersions plated onto substrates such as silicon plates using multiple excitation wavelengths. Identification of the chirality of the tubes was made using the Kataura plot. In many instances single lines in the radial breathing mode region were recorded indicating the presence of a single tube. The implication for this observation is that there is more than adequate sensitivity to detect and identify single-walled tubes. More recently Raman excitation on an AFM using a gold-coated tip to induce surface enhancement has been achieved. In this configuration it will be possible to map the topology of the tubes using detailed information on their structural composition. © 2007 Materials Research Society.",,"Algorithms; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Photoluminescence; Quantum theory; Raman spectroscopy; Array detector; Excitation-emission; Raman microscopy; Spectrofluorometer; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40949116693

Awareness programs, especially on energy use and health targeted to the remote villages have very little successes as they are proved to be very expensive and are most of the time ignored. This has become of the people of Dahachowk village in Kathmandu valley, especially of the women as regard to their exposure to the indoor air pollution since they are the ones that spend most of their time in the ill managed firewood burning kitchen feeding their family. The village having approximately 300 households with about 1800 people living in use 2.4 tones of firewood each day (about 8 Kg of firewood per family per day). The paper reveals the systematic approach based on PDCA cycle used to implement the outlined Action Plan for decreasing the exposure time for the kitchen users as a result of continual improvement in indoor air quality. The paper portrays before and after situation that has prevailed among the women of Dahachowk village who are the part of the system now. Productivity increase and economic gain among the women is measured in terms of their income generated through their indulgence in different economic activities due to decrease in exposure time and their family's health costs. This approach is practically proven so as to be comfortably replicated in developing countries having similar social conditions like Nepal's. Social acceptance in terms of delegation of responsibilities has been highly focused for making the implementation process a success.","Biomass combustion; Dahachowk; Economic gain; Firewood; Household women; Ignorant; Implementation process; Indicators; Indoor air pollution; Indoor air quality; PDCA cycle; PM10 concentration; Productivity; Replicated; Social acceptance; Targets","Environmental impact; Health care; Particles (particulate matter); Productivity; Rural areas; Biomass combustion; Dahachowk; Economic gain; Household women; Implementation process; Indoor air quality; Social acceptance; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247237159

The structural results confirm that the majority of the macrocyclic C-S linkages adopt gauche conformations with all sulfur atoms being exo-orientated with respect to the macrocyclic ring, while the oxygen atoms, when present, are endo-orientated. The pendant arms, formed by reaction of the parent macrocycle with acyl isocyanates, are twisted from co-planarity and typically form a distorted U-shape with angles between planes formed around the carbonyl units varying from 50.81° to 68.05°. The dominant motif in these structures involves dimeric units linked through hydrogen-bonds: however, such a network is disrupted in [12]aneS3N-CSNHCOPh by the substitution of a carbonyl unit for a thiocarbonyl unit. When more than one amide unit is present in the pendant arm, intramolecular hydrogen-bond networks are observed resulting in coplanar pendant arms and highly directional hydrogen-bonding. Inclusion of a methylene linker between the macrocycle and carbonyl function in the pendant arm inhibits intermolecular hydrogen-bond formation resulting in interaction of the amide proton with the macrocyclic nitrogen centres. A single crystal X-ray structure of [Ag([12]aneS 3N-CH2CONH-tBu)(NO3)] confirms binding of Ag(i) to the macrocyclic moiety with additional hydrogen-bonding [N-H⋯O 2.901(3) Å] between the macrocyclic pendant arm amide unit and the nitrate anion demonstrating that in the solid-state these ligands can act as heteroditopic receptors for metal salts. Overall, the solid-state structure of this complex is a one-dimensional polymer in which the Ag(i) cation is in a distorted square-pyramidal geometry with the apical sulfur donor emanating from an adjacent macrocyclic molecule. The efficacy of these ligands in competitive membrane transport and liquid-liquid metal ion extraction of Co(ii), Ni(ii), Cu(ii), Zn(ii), Cd(ii), Ag(i) and Pb(ii) has been assessed using selected ligands. In preliminary experiments, clear extraction and transport selectivity for Ag(i) was observed in all systems investigated, while only modest extraction of TcO4- was identified. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.",,"amide; cadmium; carbene; carbonyl derivative; cobalt; copper; heterocyclic compound; isocyanic acid derivative; lead; macrocyclic compound; nickel; nitrate; silver; sulfide; sulfur; zinc; article; crystal structure; hydrogen bond; liquid liquid extraction; membrane transport; metal extraction; priority journal; solid state; synthesis; X ray crystallography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846231835

The ions collide with neutral air molecules, exchanging momentum, causing the neutral molecules to move. Continued collisions and momentum exchanges generate a net flow called an ionic wind [1]. Ionic winds formed near flat plates can produce local boundary layer distortion in the presence of a bulk flow. This concept has been studied experimentally at the macroscale as a method for drag reduction [2] and has been suggested at the microscale for convective cooling enhancement [3]. Specifically, microfabricated ion wind engines can be integrated onto electronic chips to provide additional local cooling at ""hot-spot"" locations. In our previous work, continuum modeling of the ionic wind phenomena showed an approximately 50% increase in the local heat transfer coefficient at the location of the ion wind engine [3]. However, in that work, ionization physics were not modeled, rather assumptions for ion current and concentrations were used as a basis for modeling ion transport. At the microscale, ionization occurs when field-emitted electrons from closely spaced electrodes collide with neutral air molecules, stripping away electrons and forming molecular ions. Geometric enhancement of the electrodes using nanostructured materials enables low ionization voltages conducive to microelectronic devices. Understanding the microscale ionization process is necessary to accurately predict the ensuing ionic wind and cooling. Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) is used in the present work to predict field emission between two planar electrodes and the consequent ionization of the interstitial air.

The ensuing heat from combustion is then used to melt the solid aluminum and heat the liquid metal. Of increasing concern to the industry are the more stringent regulations in regard to NOx emissions from these plants. The formation of NOx mainly depends on the concentration of nitrogen and the temperature of the gas. One problem that affects this formation that has not been adequately addressed is the variability of the local natural gas supply. Natural gas has molecular nitrogen as a portion of its composition. This percentage ranges from approximately one to seven percent of the total mass fraction. In addition, the aluminum industry is investigating methods to reduce NOx emissions. One method is to replace some of the combustion air with pure oxygen. This reduces the amount of nitrogen coming into the furnace, but also raises the combustion temperature which could promote NOx production. This paper details a systematic computational fluid dynamics study on how the variability of the nitrogen concentration coupled with the partial replacement of air with pure oxygen affects heat transfer and pollutant formation in an aluminum furnace.

Luraghi snc, 20020 Arese (MI), Italy","In order to comply with current emissions regulations, a detailed analysis of the combustion and emission formation processes in the Diesel engines accounting for the effect of the main operating parameters is required. The present study is based both on OD and 3D numerical simulations by compiling OD chemical kinetics calculations for Diesel oil surrogate combustion and emission (soot, NOx) formation mechanisms to construct a φ-T (equivalence ratio - temperature) parametric map. In this map, the regions of emissions formation are depicted defining a possible optimal path between the regions by placing on the same map the engine operation conditions represented by the computational cells, whose parameters (equivalence ratio and temperature) are calculated by means of 3D engine modelling. Unlike previous approaches based on static parametric φ-T maps to analyze different combustion regimes and emission formations in Diesel engines, the present paper focuses on a construction of dynamic φ-T maps, in which the pressures and the elapsed times were taken in compliance with those calculated in the 3D engine simulations. The 0D chemical kinetics calculations have been performed by the SENKIN code of the Chemkin-2 library. In-cylinder conditions represented by computational cells with known φ and T are predicted using KIVA-3V code. When cells are plotted on the map, they identify the trajectories helping to navigate between the emissions regions by varying hardware and injection parameters. Sub-models of the KIVA-3V, rel. 2 code has been modified including spray atomization, droplet collision and evaporation, accounting for multi-component fuel vapor coupled with the improved versions of the chemistry/ turbulence interaction model and new formulation of the combustion kinetics for the diesel oil surrogate (consisting in 70 species participating in 310 reactions). Simulations were performed for the HSDI 1.300 Fiat Diesel engine at optimized engine operating conditions and pilot injections. Finally, numerical results are compared with the experimental data on in-cylinder pressure, Rate of Heat Release, RoHR, and selected species distributions.

Most of these buildings are based on design patterns of developed countries and they do not consider the local climate and elemental design strategies for improving their thermal behavior in cooling periods of the year. Due to this, office buildings show overheating problems and a high cooling energy demand. For two buildings of Santiago, preliminary studies through simulations made with TRNSYS, allowed to conclude that some free cooling design strategies -such as nocturnal natural ventilation- are highly effective. Through TRNSYS, it is not possible to study the effect of wind on natural ventilation of buildings, nor can either quantify the effect caused by the opening of windows in ventilation. In this work we have used TAS, software that allows the indicated studies. This paper shows the feasibility of reaching the necessary ventilation through windows, for an efficient cooling of two buildings already constructed in Santiago. It is observed that using this strategy, energy saving is possible to be obtained. More than 50% of energy saving respecting to the two studied buildings of Santiago, may be reached when using this effective design strategy.","Cooling; Natural ventilation","Cooling designs; Cooling energy; Design Patterns; Design strategies; Developed countries; Local climate; Mediterranean climates; Natural ventilation; Thermal behaviors; Climatology; Cooling; Energy conservation; Energy management; Office buildings; Ventilation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865752371

It has proved to be superior to other processes because of its low fuel consumption, reduced fugitive-emissions and high production rate. Despite of all these advantages, Flash Smelting presents some operational problems, the most important being the control of magnetite formation and dust loss in the off-gases. The control of these variables is difficult due to poor understanding of the complex interactions between the processes involved, such as thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, mass and heat transfer, local distribution of oxygen concentration, and fluid-flow conditions. One practical tool to understand these complex interactions is the study of flame propagation in the Copper Concentrate (CC) cloud. In this work we developed an experimental method to estimate the velocity of the flame propagation in a CC cloud. We performed measurements in a vertical burner using rich mixtures, which showed that flame speed is inversely proportional to particle size and CC concentration. Also, the flame speed is mainly a function CC/oxygen mass ratio, independent of the oxygen dilution in the gas. In this moment, as a second part of this investigation, we are developing a mathematical model to predict flame speeds of the same order of magnitude and trend as the ones measured experimentally. The model includes heat generation and all modes of heat transfer i.e. conduction, convection, and radiation. © 2006 Sociedad Chilena de Química.","Copper concentrate combustion; Flame speed; Particle combustion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745929064

In order to achieve this, a modeling architecture is developed based on a state-vector platform where component sub-models can be easily developed and integrated, forming a larger system which can simulate vehicle operations. The innovation presented in this paper is the modular simulation architecture that allows investigation of a large number of different system architectures without having to manually parameterize each configuration. The system model can then be used as the basis from which multidisciplinary, multi-objective, system-wide analysis can be performed.

In addition, several states have also enacted legislation requiring control of mercury emissions from coalburning plants. Methods for the detection of mercury in flue gas are needed in order to determine compliance with state and federal regulations. Photo-deposition of mercury upon a quartz substrate is shown to be a simple and inexpensive method for the semicontinuous determination of total mercury in coal-derived flue gases. A small particulate-free slipstream of flue gas is heated to temperatures above 950°F, converting all of the mercury to the elemental form. A small stream of oxygen or air is blended into the slipstream, which is cooled to temperatures below 280°F. Short-wave 254-nm ultraviolet (UV) light is applied to the resulting gas mixture, yielding quantitative deposition of mercuric oxide upon a quartz substrate, and forming the basis for a SCEM. The quartz substrate can be a surface acoustic wave (SAW) mass sensor, allowing for near instant detection of total mercury in the flue gas. The UV-SAW combination results in a simple SCEM for total mercury in flue gas. It has the advantages of being a dry environmentally friendly system which is reliable, inexpensive, and has the potential for being fully automated.",,"Acoustic surface wave devices; Deposition; Flue gases; Fossil fuel power plants; Mercury (metal); Regulatory compliance; Ultraviolet radiation; Photo-deposition; Slipstream; Surface acoustic wave (SAW) mass sensors; Trace analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748826151

Then the arguments for new weather extremes due to climate change will be introduced before I speak about changed extremes of the recent past and the lack of scientific rigor for the introduction of the so-called 100-year event.

At the same time it would create good non-exportable jobs, and local industries. Twenty four examples of wasted or under-utilized solids that contain appreciable organic matter are listed. Estimates of their sustainable tonnage lead to a total SW exceeding 2 billion dry tons. Now usually disposal problems, most of these SW's, can be pyrolyzed into substitutes for or supplements to expensive natural gas. The large proportion of biomass (carbon dioxide neutral plant matter) in the list reduces Greenhouse problems. Pyrolysis converts such solid waste into a medium heating value gaseous fuel usually with a small energy expenditure. With advanced gas cleaning technologies the pyrogas can be used in high efficiency gas turbines or fuel cells systems. This approach has important environmental and efficiency advantages with respect to direct combustion in boilers and even air blown or oxygen blown partial combustion gasifiers. Since pyrolysis is still not a predictive science the CCTL has used an analytical semi-empirical model (ASEM) to organize experimental measurements of the yields of various product {CaHbOc} yields vs temperature (T) for r dry ash, nitrogen and sulfur free (DANSF) feedstock having various weight% of oxygen [0] and hydrogen [H], With this ASEM each product is assigned 5 parameters (W, T0, D, p, q) in a robust analytical Y(T) expression to represent yields vs. temperature of any specific product from any specified feedstock. Patterns in the dependence of these parameters upon [O], [H], a, b, and c suggest that there is some order in pyrolysis yields that might be useful in optimize the throughput of particular pyrolysis systems used for waste to energy conversion (WEC). An analytical cost estimation (ACE) model is used to calculate the cost of electricity (COE) vs the cost of fuel (COF) for a SW pyrogas fired combined cycle (CC) system for comparison with the COE vs COF for a natural gas fired CC system. It shows that high natural gas prices solid waste can be changed from a disposal cost item to a valuable asset. Comparing COEs when using other SW capable technologies are also facilitated by the ACE method. Implications of this work for programs that combine conservation with waste to energy conversion in efforts to reach Zero Waste are discussed.

It is thus very important to survey NSS spectra in frequency bands such as 1215-1300 MHz, 1525 - 1626.5 MHz and 2483.5 - 2500 MHz. This article presents the results of a measurement campaign of NSS satellite signals which took place at the monitoring earth station of Leeheim (Germany) during the second half of 2005. This station, operated by the Bundesnetzagentur, provides two steerable parabolic antennas with diameters of 6 and 12 meters. These ones are very useful to observe NSS spread spectrum signals whose power is well under the noise floor. The measurement campaign was performed on the regional NSS Beidou and on both GNSS Glonass and GPS. Beidou is a Chinese regional positioning system composed of three geostationary satellites mainly covering the country and its neighbouring areas. The only Beidou satellite (named Beidou 1B) visible from Leeheim station was pointed and measurements were performed at the signal center frequency of 2491.5 MHz. Then the spectra of the two modernized Glonass satellites, numbered 701 and 712 and launched at the end of 2003 and 2004, were measured in the 1585 - 1625 MHz and 1235 - 1265 MHz frequency bands. Comparison with old generalton of Glonass satellites showed significant reduction of emissions in the radioastronomy band (1610.3-1613.8 MHz) as it had been requested by IUCAF in 1993. Finally the new GPS satellite, named GPS IIR-M (for Modernized GPS II Replacement), launched at the end of September 2005 was tracked. Spectrum measurements at L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L2 (1227.60 MHz) frequencies were made. New L2 civil signal (L2C) was observed.",,"Frequency bands; Navigation Satellite Systems; Navigation signals; Spectrum measurements; Electromagnetic compatibility; Natural frequencies; Radio astronomy; Satellites; Signal processing; Satellite navigation aids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645962473

Worldwide, the chemical pulping industry particularly, has spent billions of dollars on odour monitoring and control equipment in order to minimize the emission of odorous pulping by-products into the atmosphere. Most jurisdictions in developed countries have laws and regulations governing the amounts of odorous materials that can be emitted and the levels of these materials has fallen significantly over the last 10 years as a result of new pollution control technologies having been introduced. Despite these improvements, that largely operate to minimise emissions from defined point sources of odour, complaints regarding fugitive odour as a source of community nuisance and loss of amenity continue to be a significant factor in limiting general acceptance of the pulp and paper industry as one that is environmentally benign and sustainable. A major factor that has limited the ability of the industry to improve its performance in controlling fugitive emissions has been the lack of cost-effective techniques for collecting, quantifying and identifying odorous compounds in air under conditions where the concentrations are varying over many orders of magnitude in a period of hours, or even minutes. In order to address this problem, Ensis Papro and Covey Consulting embarked on a collaborative research and development program that has resulted in a device that can pass controllable quantities of air through absorbents for pre-determined periods, ranging from 0.1-100 hours, and extract a wide range of odorous materials for subsequent identification and quantitative analysis in the laboratory. The cost of the new Odour Monitoring Station (OMS) is low enough to enable a dozen or more units to be placed at strategic points around a mill, or other industrial facility, or on neighbouring properties and to create a detailed odour map that can then be combined with prevailing meteorological data to pin-point the most likely sources of the fugitive odour. The new technique has been used in two kraft mills and in their environs to create better understanding of the nature and sources of diffuse odour emissions. In one case, knowledge of the composition of the odour compounds present enabled mill engineering staff to also identify a process control strategy that was unintentionally forcing odour compounds to move in an unexpected manner into one of the mill's condensate streams. Changing the control strategy enabled the mill to reduce the number of complaints received from the community by 90% in a single month. The principles on which the design of the new Odour Monitoring Station is based are outlined. The conventional methods of odour quantification are reviewed as are the types of compounds most frequently associated with odour complaints and their most usual sources. Illustrations of some of the typical mill odour maps are discussed together with methods for using this information to identify sources of odour and to control them.","Odour Control; Odour monitoring; Sulfur Compounds; Total Reduced Sulfur; TRS; VOC; Volatile Organic Compounds","Cost effectiveness; Industrial engineering; Paper and pulp mills; Odor emissions; Odor monitoring; Total Reduced Sulfur (TRS); Odors; Cost Effectiveness; Industrial Engineering; Odors; Paper Mills; Sulfur Compounds; Voc",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748691617

These changes are driven by many different forcing and feedbacks occurring at various time and geographic scales and are largely influencing the various Earth systems. Despite the fact that the natural component of these changes has always occurred, today it's the anthropogenic component and its magnitude which is worrying. At the European scale, such changes are likely to profoundly affect terrestrial ecosystems in term of physiology, phenology, distribution and evolution. In order to improve our understanding of the effect of global changes on ecosystems, this thesis describes a range of diverse analyses into the different forcing factors for different periods of time. In the first study, palaeorecords show that climatic conditions similar to the ones predicted to occur during the coming century already occurred. European terrestrial ecosystems however were different in structure and composition. Future predictions of climatic conditions associated to plant species specific tolerances ranges have been used in the second and third studies to quantify geographically the risk for such species in being able to find suitable climate space by the end of the century. In general, northern species will face a drastic reduction of their suitable climatic space as southern species are likely to face an expansion in climate space. However, to reach a suitable climate species may have to travel great distances and overcome natural and human barriers. Finally, the last two studies explored with the help of the state of the art dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS, the different interactions between climatic changes, disturbances rates and exotic plant invasion and Mediterranean European ecosystems compositions and functions. Disturbance has been shown to be the main driving factor of these ecosystems characteristics, and influenced largely the likely success of invasions in some ecosystems. However, at the local scale, climatic conditions and the degree of invasion, were likely to influence ecosystems composition, distribution and functions but in a less radical ways. Such approaches, allowed us to explore the relevance of the different forcing factors on ecosystems changes. Future development of these analytic methods by adopting more integrating methods should aim to support societal decisions and actions.","Climatic risk; European species; Global changes; Plant invasion; Pollen analysis; Vegetation modelling","climate effect; ecosystem response; environmental risk; global change; modeling; plant; vegetation; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646015363

Today's mine managers must juggle competing pressures to deliver sound social, environmental and economic results. Leadership is a fundamental tool for the effective mine manager. Whilst mine managers require solid technical and operational skills, importantly the manager must be able to engage a workforce, build and retain employees and seize opportunity for growth and development when presented. An important tool for engaging employees in the business at Rio Tinto Aluminium is the business improvement programme. At Rio Tinto Aluminium's Weipa mine, the business improvement methodology Six Sigma is used to deliver measurable, sustainable outcomes for the business. The next step in Rio Tinto Aluminium's improvement journey is to implement Lean Manufacturing at all managed operations. The operating environment for mine managers continuously evolves and effective mine managers must be flexible and adaptive to meet challenges. Governance and regulation constantly change in an environment of commodity cycles and finite resources. This increases pressure on the economic return achieved by the operation. As such, effective mine managers must be aware of and manage the operating environment - the broader, issues-based environment not just the immediate day-to-day responsibility of mine managing. This includes delivering on safety, community and environmental priorities. At Rio Tinto Aluminium, part of managing the business is via investment in the area of social partnerships to engage employees and the broader community in Rio Tinto Aluminium's commitment to sustainability.

Design and assessment of multifunctional agricultural landscapes can be supported by exploration of the potential to effectively combine economic performance, landscape quality, nature conservation and environmental quality. This paper presents the Landscape IMAGES methodology for spatially explicit exploration of options for multifunctional agriculture in landscapes at a scale of a few km2. The framework has been developed to support discussions and informed decision making by local and regional policy makers, land owners and land managers and other relevant stakeholders. The structure of the Landscape IMAGES framework is elaborated and its functioning is illustrated with a near-real example of a grassland-based landscape with hedge rows bordering the fields. In this landscape, four objectives are being pursued by adjusting land-use intensity and hedge row presence: 1. acceptable agronomic yields for farms; 2. diversification of the botanical composition of fields and hedge rows; 3. variation in plant communities in the fields and halfopenness of the landscape; and 4. reduction of nutrient emissions to the environment. For exploration of trade-offs between multiple objectives a heuristic search method (differential evolution) is employed, which yields a large range of alternative, acceptable configurations of the landscape. The framework provides explicit insight in the trade-offs between the objectives and is implemented in a visual application that enables assessment of alternative options. The method can be applied to a range of spatially explicit land-use and nature allocation problems and will be further developed in interaction with stakeholders. © Wageningen Academic Publishers.

This special issue of Climate Policy explores these three factors in depth. This policy overview summarizes key insights from the individual studies in this issue, and draws overall policy conclusions about the next round of allocations and the design of the system for the longer term. • Allocations for 2008–2012. Allocations defined relative to projected ‘business-as-usual’ emissions should involve cutbacks for all sectors, in part to hedge against an unavoidable element of projection inflation. Additional cutbacks for the power sector could help to address distributional and legal (State aid) concerns. Benchmarking allocations, e.g. on best practice technologies, could offer important advantages: experience in different sectors and countries is needed, given their existing diversity. However, a common standard for new entrant reserves should be agreed across the EU, based on capacity or output, not on technology or fuel. Maximum use of allowed auctioning (10%) would improve efficiency, provide reassurance, and potentially help to stabilize the system through minimum-price auctions. These measures will not preclude most participating sectors from profiting from the EU ETS during phase II. Companies can choose to scale back these potential profits to protect market share against imports and/or use the revenues to support longer term decarbonization investments, whilst auction revenues can be used creatively to support broader investments towards a lowcarbon industrial sector in Europe. • Post-2012 design. Effective operation during phase II requires a concrete commitment to continue the EU ETS beyond 2012 with future design addressing concerns about distribution, potential perverse incentives, and industrial competitiveness. Declining free allocation combined with greater auctioning offers the simplest solution to distributional and incentive problems. For its unilateral implementation to be sustainable under higher carbon prices over longer periods, EU ETS post-2012 design must accommodate one of three main approaches for the most energy-intensive internationally traded sectors: international (sectoral) agreements, border-tax adjustments, or output-based (intensity) allocation. If significant free allocations continue, governments may also need to follow the example of monetary policy in establishing independent allocation authorities with some degree of EU coordination. Such reform for the post-2012 period would require the Directive to be fundamentally renegotiated in relation to allocation procedures. Such renegotiation is neither feasible nor necessary for phase II operation. Rather, phase II should be a period in which diverse national approaches build experience, whilst the profits potentially accruing to participating sectors can be used to protect market share and jump-start their investments for a globally carbonconstrained future. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"competitiveness; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental protection; European Union; investment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747748466

We model local H2 starvation induced cathode carbon corrosion in an operating PEM fuel cell and predict when local H2 starvation occurs and how it affects the carbon corrosion rate. We conclude that O2 crossover through membrane controls the total amount of current that goes to carbon corrosion and oxygen evolution at cathode. A membrane with lower O2 permeability allows less O2 crossover and thus less cathode carbon corrosion. The relative rate of carbon corrosion to oxygen evolution has significant implication on mitigating carbon-support corrosion: either making carbon support more corrosion-resistive or enhancing oxygen evolution can greatly reduce carbon loss with oxygen evolution reaction taking up more current.

Currently, N concentrations in forest waters are usually well below water quality standards. But elevated concentrations are frequently found in regions with chronic N input from deposition (&gt;8-10 kg ha-1 a-11). We synthesized the current understanding of factors controlling N leaching in relation to three primary causes of N cycle disruption: (i) Increased N input (air pollution, fertilization, N2 fixing plants). In European forests, elevated N deposition explains approximately half of the variability in N leaching, some of the remaining variability could be explained by differences in N availability or ""N status"". For coniferous forests, needle N content above 1.4% and (or) forest floor C:N ratio lower than 25 were thresholds for elevated nitrate leaching. At adjacent sites conifer forests receive higher N deposition and exhibit higher nitrate loss than deciduous forests; an exception is alder that shows substantial nitrate leaching through N fixation input. Fertilization with N poses limited risk to water quality, when applied to N-limited forests, (ii) Reduced plant uptake (clear-cut, thinning, weed control). The N cycle responses to plant cover disturbance by clear-cut are well studied. Nitrate losses peak after 2-3 years and are back to pre-cut levels after 3-5 years. Nitrogen losses increase with deposition and are higher at N rich sites. The extent and duration of the nitrate response is especially connected to the recovery of the vegetation sink. Less intensive disturbances like thinning have only minor effects on N loss. (iii) Enhanced mineralization of soil N (liming, ditching, climate change). Responses in nitrate leaching after liming may increase with N deposition and in older stands. However data on these types of N cycle disruption are too sparse to allow general conclusions on controlling factors. Nitrate leaching occurs when N deposition (input) and net mineralization (N status) exceed plant demand. A combined N flux to the soil of 50 to 60 kg ha-1 a-1 from N deposition and litterfall may be a threshold for nitrate leaching in undisturbed forests. This threshold also indicates risk of increasing losses in case of a disturbance (e.g., clear-cut). We conclude by discussing forest management options for water quality protection. These options focus on decreasing input, increasing plant uptake, increasing biomass removal, and (re)establishing immobilization and denitrification processes at the catchment scale. © 2006 NRC Canada.","Clear-cut; Disturbance; Forest management; Nitrate; Nitrogen cycling; Nitrogen saturation","Air pollution; Codes (standards); Data acquisition; Forestry; Natural water geochemistry; Water quality; Clear-cut; Disturbance; Nitrogen cycling; Nitrogen saturation; Nitrates; Air Pollution; Forestry; Nitrates; Standards; Water Quality; Betulaceae; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744912759

Thus we were able to compare the exact spectral function with the self-consistent first-order Born approximation. The first observation was that the exact spectral function consists of delta functions whereas the Born approximation gives a continuous spectral function. But even after an artificially broadening of the exact spectral function, striking differences remain which are due to the inability of the Born approach to exhibit all shifts and splittings in detail. As an alternative we propose an analytic solution which employs the coherent states for representing the electron-phonon Hamiltonian. The rotating-wave approximation allows to reduce the problem to an (infinite) number of decoupled 2×2 matrices. Close to resonance (zero detuning), this approximation works remarkably well. The appearance of Franck-Condon factors points to the great similarity of the electron-phonon interaction in molecules and quantum dots. We have also applied the above technique to a two-band model in order to describe linear optical properties of a single quantum dot interacting with LO phonons. The exact linear polarization and the corresponding absorption spectrum is calculated by diagonalizing the appropriate Hilbert space of four electronic levels and four bosonic modes split off from the full phonon modes via an orthogonalization procedure. Parameter values for CdSe QDs are used to describe realistic absorption spectra, and a comparison between resonant and non-resonant QDs is carried out. Signatures of the phonon bottleneck are found, i.e. a stronger quasi-dephasing for the resonant case, but this is not as dramatic as simple arguments using Fermi's golden rule for phonon emission would predict. © Società Italiana di Fisica.",,"Electron phonon couplings; Fermi's Golden Rule; First-order Born approximation; Franck-Condon factors; Linear optical properties; Linear polarization; Rotating wave approximations; Strongly correlated materials; Absorption spectroscopy; Delta functions; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Materials handling equipment; Polarons; Quantum optics; Semiconductor quantum dots; Electron-phonon interactions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884668460

In this study, the IVE model was evaluated by utilizing a dataset available from the remote sensing measurements on a large number of vehicles at five different sites in Hangzhou, China, in 2004 and 2005. For gasoline passenger cars, a total of approximately 27,000 records with valid CO and HC remote sensor readings, and 24,000 records with valid NO readings were available for the IVE model evaluation. For light duty gasoline trucks (LGDT) the remote sensing dataset contained 2,550 records with valid CO and HC readings and 2,000 records of valid NO readings. Average fuel-based emission factors derived from the remote sensing measurements were compared with corresponding emission factors derived from IVE calculations for urban, hot stabilized condition. The results show a good agreement between the two methods for gasoline passenger cars' (PC) HC emission for all IVE subsectors and technology classes. In the case of CO emissions, the modeled results were relatively good, although systematically underestimate the emissions by almost 12~50% for different technology class. However, the model totally overestimated NOx emissions. The IVE NOx emission factors were 1.5~3.5 times of the remote sensing measured ones. The IVE model was also evaluated for LDGT, heavy duty gasoline vehicles (HDGV) and motor cycles (MC). A notable result was observed that the decrease in emissions from technology class Euro II to Euro I were overestimated by the IVE model compared to remote sensing measurements for all three pollutants.","Emission factor; Evaluation; IVE model; Remote sensing","Automobiles; Developing countries; Engineering education; Exhaust gases; Gasoline; Motorcycles; Nitrogen oxides; Transportation; Vehicles; Emission factors; Evaluation; Gasoline vehicle; IVE models; NOx emissions; Number of vehicles; Remote sensors; Vehicle emission; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84915750412

However, the associated pollution problems cause gradual deterioration of the ambient environment and adverse impacts on the local community. Cleaner production (CP) technology, as an effective way to reduce waste emission and save resources, has been widely employed in the alcohol industry across the developed countries. In China, although such technologies have been applied in a number of factories, an integrated assessment and implementation procedure is lacking for proceeding with practical CP technologies for alcohol factories in China. To solve such problems, a series of cleaner production options are proposed and assessed in this study. Five groups of CP options were screened, on factory survey, expert questionnaires, and integrated assessment. With the consideration of environmental impacts and economic efficiency, four CP options combined with various advanced CP technologies, such as high-concentration wort fermenting, CO2 reuse, different pressure distilling, methane and fertilizer production, were proposed. To verify the proposed options, a case study was carried out in the Shouguang Alcohol Factory (SAF), East China. The characteristics of resources consumption and waste emission during the production process were identified. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed options was conducted from different aspects. An integrated cleaner production system based on the proposed options was formed and then implemented in the factory. Through the four years of practice, the productivity/quality of alcohol product were improved, but and the reduction of waste and pollution were achieved as well as a marked increase in water/energy savings. This study provides theoretical and practical support for extensive application of cleaner production technologies and sustainable development in the alcohol industry of China. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Interest in recovery enhanced technology of tertiary miscible or immiscible CO2 flooding is increasing in these low permeable reservoirs. In this paper, a laboratory study using a high-pressure PVT cell and a simulation study using full-field fully equation-of-state (EOS) compositional reservoir modeling were undertaken to optimize the design of a miscible or immiscible CO2 flood pilot project for the Xinli Unit in Jilin oil field. The laboratory study includes phase behavior analysis, asphaltene deposition assessment, and minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) determination in the CO2 corefloods. Based on building a full-field 3D geologic model and history matching waterflood performance, a preliminary CO2 flood reservoir modeling has been used to distinguish displacement mechanisms and reservoir performance of natural depletion, continued waterflooding, continuous CO2 and water-alternate-CO2. The simulation study and the pilot test showed water-alternate-CO2 after waterflooding is an effective method of improved oil recovery for the low permeability reservoir and it can appreciably reduce water production and enhance oil recovery. Simulation studies has also been completed to determine an optimal water-CO2 ratio, optimal CO2 slugs and optimal CO2 injection rate. The pilot operation is now well implementing according to above-mentioned study achievements. Future plans for water-alternate-CO2 optimization include continuation of performance monitoring to help optimize tapering strategy in order to enhance further oil recovery in the low permeability oil reservoir.

A complete analysis of the electronic spectra of these molecules in terms of nature, energy and intensity of electronic transitions has been provided by time-dependent density functional theory. Mixing coefficients and main configurations of the electronic states have been used to identify the states leading to the photodecomposition process. While the Rydberg state 1(n,3s) is involved in the dissociation of formyl cyanide and acetyl cyanide, the π*CC/ π*CN states are involved in the case of carbonyl cyanide and diethynyl ketone. In all cases, however, stepwise decomposition process is preferred over the concerted reaction process. Based on potential energy curves for bond dissociation and the transition state and IRC studies, it is found that besides the direct dissociation of carbonyl cyanide, a photoisomerization process through a nonplanar transition state may also occur resulting in the formation of a stable and planar isomer CNC(O)CN. A complete vibrational analysis of the higher energy isomer has been conducted and several new fundamental bands are predicted.

However, contributions from non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation (NSNF) are dependent on available carbon in the soil and environmental conditions (soil moisture and temperature). In Australia, measurements of NSNF have been made in the field by quantifying nitrogenase activity. These studies have included determinations of the moisture and temperature requirements for NSNF and for crop residue decomposition that supplies carbon to NSNF bacteria. Other studies have determined the N input by NSNF using N budget calculations. These data together with information about carbon supply and environmental conditions were used to estimate potential NSNF in the cropping zones of southern Australia. Using the ArcviewGIS Spatial Analyst (v3.1), maps of Australia showing estimates of NSNF in different cropping zones as determined by rainfall and temperature or carbon availability were generated. In Western Australia (represented by Wongan Hills) and South Australia (represented by Avon), where summers are dry, estimates of NSNF were generally low (10-15 kg N/ha from January to June) due to limitations of soil moisture. In New South Wales, particularly in the north where summer rainfall patterns develop (represented by Gunnedah), the warm, moist conditions produced higher estimates of NSNF (totaling 32-38 kg N/ha from January to June). In this region, the majority of estimated NSNF occurred in January and February leading to the depletion of carbon supplies and reduced NSNF in autumn (March?June). Information about potential supplies of N from NSNF across the cropping zones should be useful for researchers to select and study areas that are most likely to benefit from NSNF. It should also help agronomists and extension officers explain changes in N status within paddocks or within specific farming systems and to provide more accurate advice on N fertiliser requirements, particularly in low-input farming systems. © CSIRO 2006.","Crop residues; GIS; Nitrogenase activity; Rhizosphere","Bacteria; Crops; Decomposition; Fertilizers; Geographic information systems; Soils; Crop residues; Farming systems; Nitrogenase activity; Nitrogen fixation; bacterium; cropping practice; fertilizer; nitrogen fixation; Bacteria; Decay; Farm Crops; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Rhizospheres; Soil; Australasia; Australia; South Australia; Western Australia; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745675336

These emissions spread inland. If we just take into account NOx emissions, which could be present for as long as three days, they could reach between 400 and 1,200 km inland. (1) Recent studies suggest that NOx emissions from marine diesel engines represent about 17% of the total NOx emissions produced by fossil fuel combustion. Effective techniques in reducing or eliminating these emissions can be divided into three main categories, depending on the stage they are applied in the combustion process. These categories include: pre-combustion, combustion and post-combustion emissions control techniques. In this article we are presenting a practical method to control the combustion conditions through NOx measurements in medium speed marine diesel engines on ships. In medium speed vessels the control methods usually focus on the reading of exhaust emissions temperatures and, in some cases, the state of the combustion pressures. We have taken many measurements of NOx emissions in some marine diesel engines of 600 kW on board and we have detected combustion anomalies. The timing difference between cam and pump drive was enough to produce NOx concentrations higher than 20% of the main emissions. Annex VI of MARPOL 73/78 &amp; the NOx Code came into force on 18th May 2005 for marine engines. It set a NOx limit and periodical checks. These only affect engines &gt;130 kW installed on ships built after 1st January 2000 or that underwent a major conversation after that date. The existing ones are not affected by this annex. (There are 25,000 ships over 25 years old still on service.) Most marine engine builders are trying to reach the above mentioned limits. However, it is obvious that the modifications already performed on new engines cannot be applied to the existing ones. Nevertheless we can obtain valuable data on the combustion and engine efficiency as shown in this article. © 2006 Old City Publishing, Inc.","Emissions control from marine diesel combustion; Marine diesel combustion; NOx formation","Diesel engines; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Sailing vessels; Speed; Atmospheric emissions; Marine diesel combustion; Marine engines; Diesel engines; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Marine engines; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Sailing vessels; Speed; diesel engine; emission control; European Union; exhaust emission; fluid injection; nitrogen oxides; pollutant source; vessel; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247248213

These nonlinear phenomena cannot be explained by the usual thermokinetic efect, because temperature is constant, and must caused by a complex interaction of multiple reaction and adsorption steps. Recently, a detailed kinetic reaction scheme including over 20 reaction steps has been proposed for the catalytic CO oxidation, NOx reduction and hydrocarbons oxidation taking place in a three-way catalytic converter (TWC), the most common reactor for detoxification of automobile exhaust gases.

We perform these calculations using a mixed basis of oscillator and complexWoods-Saxon states for chosen partial waves. From this starting point, we build a spherical Gamow-Hartree-Fock basis from a renormalized interaction of the low-momentum type generated from the N3LO two-body potential. The Gamow- Hartree-Fock basis, which is a Berggren basis, treats bound, resonant, and continuum states on an equal footing, and is therefore optimal for the description of nuclear states which may be embedded in the continuum. Within this ab-initio approach, we are able to calculate that 3-4He are stable against particle decay, while 5He has a non-negligible width and is therefore unstable with respect to one neutron emission, as is the case experimentally. We illustrate from these calculations that the CCSD approach is as accurate for closed-shell nuclei as for open-shell nuclei with ±1 nucleon outside a closed-shell. Finally, we perform various tests on the convergence of our CCSD results. We find that our results are well converged with respect to basis size and discretization of the continuum integral defining our Berggren basis.",,"Closed shells; Continuum state; Coupled-cluster calculations; Discretizations; Hartree-fock; Nuclear state; Partial waves; Particle decay; Astrophysics; Isotopes; Molecular physics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887451781

In order to increase gas storage capabilities and provide operators with improved geotechnical design and operating guidelines for these caverns, stability analyses of single bedded salt cavern have been completed and are described in this paper. This work is a part of integrated efforts initiated and sponsored by the US Department of Energy, Gas Technology Institute, and Pipeline Research Council International, Inc. Numerical geomechanical models have been developed to investigate single cavern deformation and bedding plane slip for a variety of cavern configurations. A viscoplastic salt model has been developed based on an empirical creep law developed for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Program and combined with a Drucker-Prager model for damage and failure. The non-salt materials are described with either a traditional Mohr-Coulomb model, or an elastic model, depending on layer properties. A baseline model with specified geometric dimensions is first selected and subjected to one year cyclic pressure operations. The amount of damage around the cavern wall and roof is evaluated and used as a comparison in the study. Then the operations are extended to 15 years to study cavern stability for long term gas storage and operations. In addition to the baseline model, parametric studies have been performed to investigate cavern damage as a function of salt roof thickness, overburden stiffness, interface properties, and cavern geometries. Each cavern simulation includes one year of pressure cycling with a minimum, mean, and maximum cavern pressure of 6.1 MPa (884.5 psi), 8.8 MPa (1276 psi) and 14.9 MPa (2160.5 psi), respectively. Different operation conditions, e.g. hydrostatic, cyclic, and a direct pressure drawdown, are compared and evaluated in terms of cavern stability. These analyses can serve as a basis to select the best salt cavern candidate for gas storage and operations. They can also help to assess critical cavern design parameters for thin bedded salt formations.

This procedure starts with dispersing an AP-SWNT sample in an aqueous surfactant by using a sonicator. Then the optical absorption spectrum of the suspension is measured in the visible and the near-infrared regions by using a spectrophotometer. This spectrum features the superposition of the structures originating from the inter-band transitions in the electronic density of states (DOS) of the SWNTs and the structures originating from the π-plasmons in both SWNTs and carbonaceous impurities. With multiple AP-SWNT samples, the obtained optical absorption spectra are converted into a single plot that can directly indicate the relative levels of the carbonaceous impurities. In this approach, the discrepancy in the concentrations of the SWNT suspensions does not affect the evaluation. © 2006 IEEE.","π-plasmon; Carbonaceous impurity; Electronic density of states; Single-walled carbon nanotube; Solution-phase spectrophotometry; Surfactant","Absorption; Absorption spectra; Absorption spectroscopy; Carbon nanotubes; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electronic density of states; Energy absorption; Infrared spectroscopy; Light absorption; Meteorological instruments; Molecules; Nanocomposites; Nanopores; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes; NEMS; Optical materials; Optical systems; Spectrophotometry; Spectrum analysis; Statistical methods; Surface active agents; Suspensions (components); Suspensions (fluids); Carbonaceous impurities; Data analysis; Electronic densities; Inter-band transitions; international conferences; Molecular systems; Near infra red (NIR) region; Optical absorption spectrum; Single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTA); Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs); spectrum features; SWNT suspensions; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46149124340

This article first discusses the characterization of mitigation scenarios and systematically classifies mitigation scenarios. Second, quantitative analyses on gross domestic product (GDP), population, carbon intensity, energy intensity, and carbon taxes are conducted at the regional level in the four regional aggregations used by the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios. Results show that the range of emissions trajectories is extensive and that the maximum potential mitigation of global CO2 emissions from the baseline level by 2100 is around 95%. There is a correlation between GDP growth and energy intensity improvement. The relationship between energy intensity improvement and carbon intensity reduction changes over the 21st century, with energy intensity improvement outweighing carbon intensity reduction in the first half of the century and carbon intensity reduction becoming more dominant in the latter half. Predicted carbon tax levels for 2100 range from around 50 to 1400 US$/t-C, although a uniform level of carbon tax brings about widely varying CO2 mitigation outcomes across different regions. The range of GDP loss, resulting from CO2 emissions mitigation, varies from −10% to 40% in 2100, with GDP losses in developing regions more evident than those in developed regions. © 2006, Springer Japan.","Database; Emission scenarios; Greenhouse gases; Integrated assessment models; Mitigation scenarios",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64549163376

Two different elliptic burner geometries with aspect ratios (AR) of 3:1 and 4:1 were used. A circular burner with the same discharge area as that of the elliptic burner was employed for comparison. Measurements were taken at stoichiometric and three other equivalence ratios. Global flame characteristics such as visible height, emission indices, and flame radiation were measured. Flame structure data such as transverse profiles of inflame concentrations of combustion products and local flame temperature were also measured at three axial locations in the flame. Results indicate that elliptic burner flames were shorter, more radiating, and produced lower NO and CO emissions than the corresponding circular burner flames. Results from the inflame measurements of NO and CO were in good agreement with the corresponding global data. Further, the 4:1 AR elliptic burners exhibited a twin-jet flame structure at fuel-rich conditions. The twin-flame structure was evident from the inflame measurements of temperature and combustion species. This study suggests that the combination of elliptic burner geometry and coflow reduces NO and CO emissions from combustion systems, which could potentially lead to cleaner environment.

The goal of the NETL regional partnerships program is to assess carbon sequestration opportunities that exist throughout the United States and Canada. The PCOR Partnership region covers an area of over 1.3 million square miles and includes nine states and three Canadian provinces. During Phase I activities, an inventory was made of the region's major stationary CO2 sources, and many of the major geologic and terrestrial sinks were identified and characterized. The most likely sequestration options were matched to the CO2 produced by a given type of point source. Phase I activities identified thirteen cement/clinker production facilities located within the PCOR Partnership region. Collectively, they emit a total of approximately 12.5 million short tons of CO2/yr, which is 2.3% of the CO2 emitted from point sources in the region. Amine scrubbing currently offers the best near-term potential for effective separation of CO2 from cement kiln exit gases, with the cost of capturing and separating CO2 from cement kiln exit gases estimated to range from $41 to $45/short ton. Compressing it to pipeline pressures costs about $9/short ton. The design and siting of cement production facilities should consider the possibility of CO2 capture and sequestration at some point in the future. While on the surface it may seem as if capture of CO2 from cement kilns will result in increased costs to the industry, it in fact may offer significant opportunities for development of new revenue streams, enhanced corporate image, new product development through attendant research and development, and potential efficiency gains in overall process operation.",,"Carbon dioxide; Industrial management; Kilns; Process control; Product design; Reduction; Carbon sequestration; Clinker production; Production facilities; Cement industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751055244

Box 38000, 1030 BN Amsterdam","Most industrial scale reactive distillations (more than 130), operated worldwide today, will be reported. Most of these plants started up less than 15 years ago. In most cases, variable cost, capital expenditure and energy requirements are reduced by 20 % or more, compared to the classic set-up of a reactor followed by distillation. This rapid invasion of a new unit operation into the petrochemical processing industry is mainly due to technology providers CDTECH and Sulzer Chemtech with pilot plant facilities and scale-up knowledge, reducing commercial scale introduction to low risk levels. Chemical manufacturing companies have also developed their own specific reactive distillations by their own research and development. These companies, both on their own and in consortia, also developed heuristic process synthesis rules and expert software to identify the attractiveness and technical feasibility of reactive distillation. Heuristic rules and expert software will be presented and supported by examples. Moreover a sustainable development analysis is used to highlight the contributions of reactive distillation to economics, capital cost and variable cost reduction (prosperity), lower emissions to the environment (planet) and improvements on safely, health and society impact (people). Industrial reactive distillation systems comprise homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysed, irreversible and reversible reactions, covering large ranges of reactions, notably hydrogenations, hydrodesulphurisation, esterifications and etherification. Various commercial methods for packing heterogeneous catalyst in columns are now available. Barriers for commercial implementation and how to overcome are also indicated. Academic research has produced methods to identify the feasibility of reactive distillation, to determine the feed locations, to select packing types, to sequence columns optimally and also produced methods to design, optimise and control the columns with steady state and dynamic simulation models. The forecast for the application of reactive distillation in the petrochemical industry, is that many reactions, homogeneous and heterogeneously catalysed, equilibrium and irreversible, will be implemented commercially. Moreover in some separations, selective reversible chemical reactions will be applied in reactive extractive distillation set-ups to replace expensive distillations. The forecast for academic research is that process synthesis heuristics on feasibility and attractiveness will be developed for irreversible reactions. Heuristics will be generated to combine reactive reaction and dividing wall columns and or combining them with heat exchangers inside the column. Design and simulation tools will be developed that include reactions, residence time distribution, mass transfer, heat transfer and impulse transfer.",,"Esterification; Heuristic methods; Hydrogenation; Mass transfer; Petrochemical plants; Research and development management; Sustainable development; Etherification; Expert software; Impulse transfer; Industrial reactive distillation systems; Distillation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748816918

EPA's Enforcement Division insists using litigation to impose command-and-control emission reductions on the utility industry while the Air Office prefers market-based regulatory approaches such as the CAIR rule. In addition, Congress may enact the Clear Skies legislation which could dramatically alter the debate. During 2004, Duke Energy was absolved from liability at the trial court level. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to disturb the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals declaration that EPA's administrative compliance order to TVA was ""legally inconsequential"" and that the Environmental Appeals Board process ""entirely ignored the concept of the rule of law.""

However, it is well known that since such new combustion techniques precisely control combustion temperatures and local air-fuel ratios by varying the amount of air, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) ratio and the fuel injection timing, they have the issues of being less stable than conventional combustion techniques and of performance that is subject to variance in the fuel and driving conditions. This study concerns a system that addresses these issues by detecting the ignition timing with in-cylinder pressure sensors and by controlling the fuel injection timing and the amount of EGR for optimum combustion onboard.

These systems are interconnected to the Medium Voltage Distribution network, but they can be also operated isolated from the main grid, in case of faults in the upstream network. From the customer point of view, Microgrids provide both thermal and electricity needs, and in addition enhance local reliability, reduce emissions, improve power quality by supporting voltage and reducing voltage dips, and potentially lower costs of energy supply. This paper outlines selected research findings of the EU funded MICROGRIDS project (Contract ENK-CT-2002-00610). These include: • Development and enhancement of Microsource controllers to support frequency and voltage based on droops. Application of software agents for secondary control. • Development of the Microgrid Central Controller (MGCC). Economic Scheduling functions have been developed and integrated in a software package able to simulate the capabilities of the MGCC to place bids to the market operator under various policies and to evaluate the resulting environmental benefits. • Analysis of the communication requirements of the Microgrids control architecture • Investigation of alternative market designs for trading energy and ancillary services within a Microgrid.

As the situation is already tight for the regulations, snapping the last percentages out from the emission requires every and each part of the system to work perfectly.

Actually with today's new digital technology even the on/off valve can be a important player in the equation of improving process efficiency, thus reducing unwanted waste and emissions. With the modern technology it is possible to modify the on/off valve opening characteristics, get diagnostics from the condition of the valve as well as monitor the leakages from the valve.

For example, a combined strategy for climate change and local air quality can make better use of the possibilities to improve energy efficiency and introduce alternative fuels. In other words, combining environmental policies can achieve much more without additional costs. The Local Air Quality Management (LAQM) process has been in place since 1997 and through adaptation and diversification the system is now well established and can be most effective if managed correctly. Part of the LAQM process is the statutory requirement to develop an Air Quality Action Plan (AQAP) (should exceedences of an air quality objective be identified) and the non-statutory development of a local Air Quality Strategy (AQS). These and other facets of the LAQM process can be successfully adapted to integrate climate change management. To date, 183 local authorities in the UK have declared an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) for different pollutants; predominantly for NO2 and PM10. The sources of these pollutants are commonly found to be transport, industrial and domestic related; the same sources that are primarily responsible for CO2 emissions. During the development of the AQAP to alleviate the exceedence, careful consideration should be made as to whether the solution(s) utilised have a co-beneficial effect on both climate change and local air quality or if a trade-off has to be made. Due to the overlapping nature of air quality and climate change, these two facets of the LAQM system may be adapted to successfully integrate the management of local air quality and climate change and in doing so a significant and cost effective environmental benefit may be accrued.","Climate change; Co-benefit; Co-management; Local air quality management; Trade-off","air quality; climate change; conference proceeding; environmental policy; trade-off; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148945250

In order to use Solar Energy, however, the equipment required for capturing and converting it to useful heat or power must be purchased and installed. Essentially, with solar systems, you are prepaying for energy at a fixed rate over the solar system's lifetime. This requirement to pre-pay energy presents a difficulty in comparing the economics or effective cost and/or savings of energy delivered by a solar system to the cost of conventional energy sources. The purchase and installation of a solar system to heat water or generate electric power essentially locks in the cost of the energy at a fixed price over the life of the solar equipment. Once a solar system is installed, the price of the energy delivered is locked in at a levelized or ""life cycle cost"" rate based on the cost of the solar system installation, and its operating and maintenance costs over the life of the system which is between 10 and 25 years depending upon the type of system. This paper illustrates a simplified approach for developing the effective cost of solar applications to the cost of conventional alternatives. The effective cost of solar water heating and Photovoltaic (Stand-Alone &amp; Grid-Connected) systems are determined to illustrate the methodology. Given the present uncertainty of the cost of fuel oil, natural gas and electric power, locking in the price of energy delivered by a Solar system for heating water at two to five cents per kWh or $5.00 to $15.00 per MBTU is a good investment with or without the available Tax Credits, State &amp; local incentives and/or environmental benefits. The economics of the Photovoltaic systems varies significantly with the system type, Stand-Alone or Grid Connected, and utility rates and rate structure and is not as clear-cut as the solar thermal systems. It is something that should be given serious consideration. At the present time, the price of solar energy applications can be locked in at a 30% discount using the Federal Solar Tax Credit that is part of the new Energy Bill. Additionally there may be other State and local incentives that may be available for solar. The environmental benefits that range from reduction in particulate emissions and CO 2 , that can earn"" Green Tags"" yielding income, to the positive image for marketing of being environmentally friendly, i.e. Green Hotels, encouraging Ecotourism etc., also provide an intangible financial benefits for some businesses. The information that follows in this paper is intended to provide a methodology for evaluating the cost of solar energy options available to Facility &amp; Energy Managers to enable them to be better able to evaluate and compare solar to other alternative energy applications.

These locomotives are typically lightly loaded with extended periods of idle operation, and usually operate in large urban areas. With the advent of EPA emissions standards, and increasing fuel costs, many in the railroad industry are looking at replacing these locomotives with hybrid locomotives, installing APU systems or automatic start stops systems, repowering with newer engines, or using new technology to reduce emissions and improve fuel consumption. This paper documents results of research into ways to improve idle and low power emissions and fuel consumption from these roots-blown two-cycle HMD 645E engines. Specifically, this research looked at disabling one bank of injectors to simulate skip fire operation, and the stopping the rotation of one of the two roots-type blowers used to supply boost air to the uni-flow, two-cycle, diesel engine. The results of this work demonstrated that the HMD 16-645E engine did not respond positively when the injectors of one cylinder bank were disabled (simulating bank to bank skip fire operation). However, the engine did demonstrate both a reduction of NOx emissions and brake specific fuel consumption, over the US-EPA switcher and line haul emissions cycles, while operating on only one of the two blowers at idle and light loads. Additionally this concept of blower cut-out allows for reduced mass flow and higher exhaust temperatures at light loads, which could be beneficial for future application of exhaust aftertreatment. However, there is an associated increase in particulate matter emissions.

Structure fabrication is feasible on 3-dimensional surfaces, requires no mask, and is accomplished within a single process step. For the deposition of silicon oxide a binary mixture of precursor gases was used. The organic silicon precursors tend to produce significant carbon contaminations. For optical applications a low contamination level and optical transparency are crucial parameters. By optimisation of the deposition process the carbon contamination has been reduced below the limit of detection.

Episodes of drought and prolonged dry conditions (1893-1904, ca. 1942-1975, and 1999-present) alternated with relatively wet periods (1905-ca. 1941 and ca. 1976-1998), probably because of global-scale climate fluctuations. These are the El Niño-Southern Oscillation that affects interannual climate and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that evidently causes decadal-scale variability such as prolonged dry and wet episodes. Studies done in the late 20th century demonstrate that precipitation fluctuations affected populations of perennial vegetation, annuals, and small herbivores. Landscape rephotography reveals that several species, particularly creosote bush, increased in size and density during the ca. 1976-1998 wet period. A brief, intense drought from 1989 to 1991 and the ongoing drought caused widespread mortality of certain species; for example, chenopods and perennial grasses suffered up to 100% mortality.

High nitrogen (N) inputs may significantly affect the local ecosystems. Over a longer term, high loads may change the composition of the ecosystems, leading to a general decrease in local biodiversity. In Europe there is currently a significant focus on the impact of atmospheric N load on local ecosystems among environmental managers and policy makers. Model tools designed for application in N deposition assessment and aimed for use in the regulation of anthropogenic nitrogen emissions are, therefore, under development in many European countries. The aim of this paper is to present a review of the current understanding and modelling parameterizations of atmospheric N deposition. A special focus is on the development of operational tools for use in environmental assessment and regulation related to agricultural ammonia emissions. For the often large number of environmental impact assessments needed to be carried out by local environmental managers there is, furthermore, a need for simple and fast model systems. These systems must capture the most important aspects of dispersion and deposition of N in the nearby environment of farms with animal production.

The fuel cell UAV is intended to demonstrate the integration of new technologies such as fuel cell power into unmanned aerial vehicle design. The UAV is radio controlled for takeoff and landings and will employ GPS and autopilot for autonomous flight, following a set loiter pattern under cruise conditions. A later goal of autonomous takeoff and landing is desired for the eventual packaging of a portable, lightweight, non polluting UAV for use in biological data sampling of remote, environmentally sensitive research sites. The MFDCLab works in partnership with the Center for Environmental Analysis Center for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CEA-CREST), which is a research laboratory supervised by the Biology Department at California State University, Los Angeles. A need was identified for a slow speed, low altitude UAV that could be used to photograph chaparral and sample CO2 levels to facilitate research on the effects of pollutant gas emissions on plant life. A description of the composite construction of the monocoque fuselage and foam core wings is presented along with an aerodynamic analysis of the UAV design. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was used to validate the conceptual design of the UAV. A proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell with a metal hydride storage tank provides roughly 500 Watts of power. The relatively low power-to-weight ratio of the fuel cell power plant and the need for a low flight speed, dictated the use of a high aspect ratio wing in the UAV's aerodynamic configuration. This paper details the development of a fuel cell powered unmanned aerial vehicle. The design and construction of the UAV is presented along with results of aerodynamic and structural analyses.",,"Carbon dioxide; Computational fluid dynamics; Gas emissions; Global positioning system; Hydrogen fuels; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Remote control; Space research; Autonomous flight; Autopilots; Loiter patterns; Radio control; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250737333

After injection the CO 2-plume migrates along the top of the aquifer for hundreds to thousands of years. An estimate of the area invaded by the CO 2-plume is of interest for site selection. During plume migration, CO 2 is trapped as residual gas in the wake of the plume. Reduction of the mobile CO 2 volume by residual trapping would limit potential leakage. Plume evolution can be divided into an early stage, where the CO 2 has invaded the full thickness of the aquifer, and a late stage where the plume has spread enough to occupy only the top part of the aquifer. In the early regime we choose local variables for the dimensional analysis, to obtain a scaling law for the tip position x tip ∝t 1/2. At late time we choose global variables, obtaining a new scaling relation, x tip ∝ t 1/3. Numerical simulations confirm the change in scaling for the tip position. We also discuss the effect of residual trapping on plume migration, We present semi-analytic results for a plume spreading in a horizontal aquifer and numerical results for a plume in a sloping aquifer. In the horizontal aquifer plume volume decays as a power law, so that the effi ciency of residual trapping decreases with time. In the sloping case initial power law decay is followed by over faster decrease in volume. The change in scaling for the CO 2 front has not been discussed before. This change from t 1/2 to t 1/3 scaling shows that the plume will spread significantly slower at late times, suggesting that the plume will stay more confined than early measurements would indicate. Residual trapping will be very effective in sloping aquifers, and may be the dominant trapping mechanism.

Parameters describing leaf area expansion, biomass accumulation, and partitioning were derived from field experiments, and other essential parameters were assumed from similar tropically adapted legumes. The model was tested against data from experiments including different locations, cultivars, sowing dates, soil types, and water availability. Observed biomass ranged from 63 to 13055 kg dry matter/ha and was predicted by the model in an independent test with a root mean square deviation of 770 kg dry matter/ha. Observed time courses of biomass production for both the annual and perennial cultivars were reproduced well, as was the partitioning of biomass into leaves and stems. The effect of variable rainfall and temperature in northern Australia was analysed using the model and historical climate data.

In this study we took a more synthetic approach to understanding food web interactions by simultaneously examining four trophic levels and investigating how nutrient (nitrogen and carbon) and detrital subsidies impact the ability of the belowground microbial community to alter the abundance of aboveground arthropods (herbivores and predators) associated with the intertidal cord grass Spartina alterniflora. We manipulated carbon, nitrogen, and detrital resources in a field experiment and measured decomposition rate, soil nitrogen pools, plant biomass and quality, herbivore density, and arthropod predator abundance. Because carbon subsidies impact plant growth only indirectly (microbial pathways), whereas nitrogen additions both directly (plant uptake) and indirectly (microbial pathways) impact plant primary productivity, we were able to assess the effect of both belowground soil microbes and nutrient availability on aboveground herbivores and their predators. Herbivore density in the field was suppressed by carbon supplements. Carbon addition altered soil microbial dynamics (net potential ammonification, litter decomposition rate, DON [dissolved organic N] concentration), which limited inorganic soil nitrogen availability and reduced plant size as well as predator abundance. Nitrogen addition enhanced herbivore density by increasing plant size and quality directly by increasing inorganic soil nitrogen pools, and indirectly by enhancing microbial nitrification. Detritus adversely affected aboveground herbivores mainly by promoting predator aggregation. To date, the effects of carbon and nitrogen subsidies on salt marshes have been examined as isolated effects on either the aboveground or the belowground community. Our results emphasize the importance of directly addressing the soil microbial community as a factor that influences aboveground food web structure by affecting plant size and aboveground plant nitrogen. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Aboveground-belowground interactions; Detritus; Food web dynamics; Insect herbivores; Intertidal cord grass; Nitrogen mineralization; Nutrient subsidies; Plant-insect interactions; Predation; Soil microbes; Spartina alterniflora","abundance; detritus; food web; grass; insect; microbial community; nutrient availability; saltmarsh; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; trophic level; Arthropoda; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746007153

We present a simple model of private car stocks, vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) per capita and per car and CO2 emission in relation to acquisition, ownership and fuel taxes, the pre-tax user cost of cars, and income per capita. In contrast with earlier studies that have tended to focus on samples of revealed or stated preference data from specific highly developed countries(or small groups of countries), we estimate our model by means of data from 68 large cities, among which 49 from OECD countries and 19 from non-OECD countries in Asia. The implications for sustainable development of the structural differences between these taxes in terms of the model outcomes are identified. Our results indicate that acquisition and ownership taxes have little impact on behavior and environmental performance, but fuel and other use-related taxes are effective. Hence our econometric analysis suggests that taxes on variable costs have a greater impact on car ownership and use than taxes on fixed costs and that the former can be an effective way to reduce CO2 emission levels, despite the rebound effect. However, given the complexity of the transport sector and the wide range of behaviour responses that can take place in any given socio-economic and institutional setting, a ‘one size fits all' conclusion should not be drawn from the rather low-dimensional analysis conducted in this study. A very clear finding is that our results confirm the importance of the fuel tax as an effective policy instrument in transportation. The fuel tax coefficient is highly significant in our econometric model. A 1 percent increase in the fuel tax per kilometre travelled reduces car ownership density, VKT per capita and CO2 emission all by about 0.6 percent. The results are consistent with the expectation that increased fuel taxes discourage further growth in car ownership, lead to switches to other transportation modes and also lead to manufacturer and driver responses that lower CO2 emission per capita. The impact on average annual vehicle kilometres travelled per car is much less, however. The elasticity is −0.1 (significant at the 5 percent level). This low elasticity is due to the so-called rebound effect : the increasing price of fuel has led manufactures to design and sell new cars with ever-more economical engines. Consequently, the disincentive of the higher fuel price is partially offset by the greater economy, leading to a lower overall impact on average VKT travelled per car per year. While the results suggest the greatest responsiveness of private car ownership and use to the fuel tax, they do not preclude that a combination of tax instruments would be more effective than a single one. © 2006, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

Gasoline vehicles achieve very low emissions through use of three-way catalysts. These systems are relatively insensitive to sulfur, being able to operate on levels of up to 500 ppm. Further reduction in sulfur will produce additional, small emission reductions. Diesel emissions may be reduced significantly using engine modifications, oxidation catalysts or exhaust gas recirculation, which may require sulfur levels of 500 ppm. Advanced diesel emissions reduction technologies such as catalyzed particulate traps and catalytic NOx devices generally require sulfur levels as low as 50 ppm.

The approach applied utilizes the optimal control technique for distributed parameter systems. A set of pointwise emission sources with a predefined location and emission characteristics is considered as the controlled object. The problem is formulated as on-line minimization of an environmental cost function, by the respective modification of emission level in the controlled sources, according to the changing meteorological conditions (e.g. wind direction and velocity). Dispersion of atmospheric pollution is governed by a multi-layer, dynamic model of SOx transport, which is the main forecasting tool used in the optimization algorithm. The objective function includes the environmental damage related to air quality as well as the cost of the controlling action. The environmental cost index depends on the current level of SOx concentration and on the sensitivity of the area to this type of air pollution. The adjoint variable, related to the main transport equation of the forecasting model, is applied to calculate the gradient of the objective function in the main optimization procedure. The test computations have been performed for a set of major power plants in the industrial region of Upper Silesia (Poland).","Air pollution; Emission control; Mathematical modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845522419

Under optical pumping at 1.55 and 1.907 μm, Pr-doped K Pb2 Br5 exhibited a broad MIR emission centered at 4.6 μm, with a bandwidth of 0.9 μm at full width half maximum. The dominant contribution of the MIR emission was assigned to the H53 → H43 transition of Pr3+ ions. The decay time of the H53 level was measured to be 26.5 ms at room temperature and remained nearly unchanged when cooling the sample to 77 K. Consistent with the energy-gap law, multiphonon emission quenching is expected to be small in Pr-doped K Pb2 Br5. A Judd-Ofelt analysis was performed and yielded a radiative lifetime of 40.7 ms for the H53 level, which suggests a radiative quantum efficiency of ∼65%. The slightly reduced quantum efficiency is most likely due to residual impurities in the crystal providing nonradiative relaxation channels. The peak emission cross section for the 4.6 μm emission was calculated to be ∼0.4× 10-20 cm2, which compares favorable to other MIR laser transitions. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",,"Emission cross section; Radiative lifetime; Relaxation channels; Crystalline materials; Praseodymium; Quenching; Relaxation processes; Semiconductor doping; Solid state lasers; Potassium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845764863

Progressive adaptation of warm tropical taxa to cool montane conditions, evolution of new neotropical montane taxa, and immigration of temperate Laurasian, Holarctic, and Austral-Antarctic elements gave shape to the present-day montane forest. Vegetational characteristics inferred from fossil plant associations reveal the altitude at the time of deposition. Neogene forests are floristically compared with contemporary forests at comparable altitudinal intervals in the surroundings of the Bogotá basin; however, the absence of taxa that had not yet arrived, or evolved, is most salient and shows that non-analogue plant communities are common. The main phases of montane forest development are: (1) pre-uplift phase of the late Miocene with abundant lowland taxa with tropical or neotropical affinities (Mauritia Kunth, Amanoa Aubl., Ceiba Miller, and representatives of Humiriaceae); montane forest rich in Podocarpaceae (potentially including Nageia Gaertn., Podocarpus L'Hér., Prumnopitys Phil., and Retrophyllum C. N. Page) covered other previously uplifted areas in the region; (2) toward the early Pliocene the area was uplifted to ca. 1000 m; the relative proportion of temperate taxa of North American and southern South American stock increased and occupied the slopes of the low mountains; and (3) by the middle Pliocene uplift had proceeded to ca. 2000-2200 m and tropical lowland taxa, which are now restricted to altitudes below 1000 m, are no longer recorded in the fossil plant associations; the increase in the number of newly appearing montane taxa (Myrica L., Turpinia Vent., Gunnera L., Bocconia L., Gaiadendron G. Don f., Daphnopsis C. Martius, and Monnina Ruiz & Pav.) suggests a significant increase of diversity. Until the late Pliocene there is little to no evidence for the existence of the páramo; taxa such as Xyris L., Hypericum L., Carex L., Montia L., and Ranunculus L. might have formed swamp or bog vegetation only. It is believed that these taxa colonized mountaintops with half-open vegetation; these areas extended when the mountains reached above upper forest line elevations. The distribution areas of the endemic genera of the Espeletiinae largely coincide with the youngest parts (< 5 Ma) of the northern Andes. Changing climatic conditions forced individual plant species to migrate vertically. Composition of plant communities changed continuously and vegetation belts frequently were altitudinally squeezed or offered possibilities for expansion. This long process stimulated speciation and provoked sequential non-analogue vegetation types. Thus, the biodiversity hotspot of the northern Andes has a dynamic history.","Andean uplift; Biome evolution; Colombia; Espeletiinae; Montane forest; Neogene; Páramo; Phytogeography","Amanoa; Bocconia; Carex; Ceiba; Daphnopsis; Gaiadendron; Gunnera; Humiriaceae; Hypericum; Monnina; Montia; Myrica; Myricaceae; Nageia; Podocarpaceae; Podocarpus; Prumnopitys; Ranunculaceae; Ranunculus; Retrophyllum; Turpinia; Xyris; Zanclea",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749028713

The average greenhouse requires about 2.85 GJ/m2/year primarily from natural gas combustion for providing both heat and CO2 for stimulating plant growth, with a total annual CO2 emission in the order of 2.5 million tones. The substitution of natural gas by biofuels will have a great potential for GHG emission reduction. The deterioration of local air quality in regions with intensive agricultural activities, on the other hand, is closely related to the emissions from animal barns, from manure storage, handling and land spreading. Approaches to address energy and emission issues for each industry in isolation have failed in the past because of the higher emissions associated with biomass fuel combustion and higher waste management cost for manure. In this paper, we present a systems approach for solving the demand of low-cost energy in greenhouse operation and the emission control associated with manure disposal by constructing a local eco-industrial network (EIN). In the new integrated operation, the manure waste from the barn will be used as a renewable fuel source for the greenhouse heating, while the increased air emission from the green houses is compensated by the reduction of emissions from manure storage, handling and land spreading. A preliminary analysis based on an average greenhouse of 1000 m2 in size showed that a net reduction of 320 tonnes/year CO2 eq. can be achieved in the integrated system, translating into an potential reduction of 1.2 million tonnes per year in BC and 3.2 million tones per year nationwide if all existing greenhouses are converted to the integrated system. On the other hand, odor gas emissions including NH3 and H2S can be eliminated in the integrated system. For manure-to-biogas energy conversion option, capital and operational cost will be a major concern and needs to be analyzed in the future. For direct manure combustion option, emission control equipment is needed to reduce emissions of particulate matters, SOx and CO to levels acceptable for greenhouse operations before the flue gas CO2 can be directly utilized in greenhouse for stimulating plant growth. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Animal barns; Energy integration; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549099123

Active control of surface condition and contamination, which can occur during the process of ion implantation, is very important and helps to improve implanted layer parameters and device characteristics. Surface properties modification and mitigation of contaminants by introducing a small amount of gases directed precisely near the target surface during ion implantation is investigated. It is shown that introducing of reactive gases containing oxygen and water vapor into a process chamber results to a significant reduction of surface carbon contamination. Typically, the carbon particles are generated by ion beam striking carbon-based surfaces such as graphite, which is a commonly used material within ion implantation systems. Additionally, photoresist material, which is usually used as a mask for ion implantation, contains carbon, which can then be released as gaseous by-product during ion implantation. Surface adsorption is considered as a potential mechanism of carbon contamination mitigation.

Three potential warm mix asphalt processes were evaluated in this study. They were Aspha-min®, Sasobit®, and Evotherm®. A laboratory study was conducted to determine the applicability of these processes to typical paving operations and environmental conditions commonly found in the United States, including the performance of the mixes in quick traffic turn-over situations and high temperature conditions. All three processes were shown to improve the compactability of mixtures in both the SGC and vibratory compactor. Statistics indicated an overall reduction in air voids. Improved compaction was noted at temperatures as low as 190°F (88°C). Superpave gyratory compactor results indicated that Aspha-min®, Sasobit®, and Evotherm® may lower the optimum asphalt content. The addition of Aspha-min®, Sasobit®, or Evotherm® did not affect the resilient modulus of an asphalt mix nor did they increase the rutting potential of an asphalt mix as measured by the Asphalt Pavement Analyzer. The rutting potential did increase with decreasing mixing and compaction temperatures, which may be related to the decreased aging of the binder resulting from the lower temperatures. There was no evidence of differing strength gain with time for the mixes containing the three processes as compared to the control mixes indicating that a prolonged cure time before opening to traffic is not an issue. The lower compaction temperature used when producing warm asphalt may increase the potential for moisture damage. Overall, Aspha-min®, Sasobit®, and Evotherm® appear to be viable tools for reducing mixing and compaction temperatures that can be readily added to hot mix asphalt. Reductions in mixing and compaction temperatures are expected to reduce fuel costs, reduce emissions, widen the winter paving window and facilitate niche applications such as airport runway construction where rapid open to traffic is essential.",,"Aging of materials; Airport runways; Asphalt pavements; Compaction; Fuel economy; High temperature operations; Mixing; Statistical methods; Air voids; Compaction temperature; Rutting potential; Vibratory compactors; Asphalt",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845535089

A Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) framework for conceptual design of aircraft, is coupled to a sound-comparison algorithm, in order to lead the configuration to the fulfillment of sound-quality-based criteria. Specifically, a design concept is considered satisfactory if its acoustic emissions match a given target sound. The work is part of the European research project SEFA. In this project, the target sound is synthesized on the basis of an extensive campaign of psychometric tests. Such an approach requires the modification of the whole sound spectrum, and, thus, introduces two main difficulties: i) each sound source must be modeled inside the MDO, in order to properly treat each frequency band; ii) a suitable measure of the similarity between the two sounds must be defined and included into the optimization objective function. In the present work we introduce the Sound Similarity Index (SSI) as the L ∞-norm of the spectral difference of the two sounds. Preliminary results, obtained for a set of suitably defined test functions, show that the SSI is capable to capture both local (i.e., tonal), as well as the distributed (i.e., broadband) differences.",,"Community noise; European research project; Multidisciplinary design optimization; Optimal design; Optimization objective function; Psychometric test; Similarity indices; Spectral differences; Conceptual design; Design aids; Frequency bands; Noise pollution; Acoustic noise",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883386081

The Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Applied Technology Workshop (ATW) on CO2 Sequestration (Galveston Island, Texas, Nov. 15-17, 2005) convened a diverse group of geoscience, engineering, economics and stakeholder experts to review the status of CCS and to identify the remaining critical issues that still serve as barriers to its acceptance and widespread deployment. Site assessment can be improved with systematic, generally accepted approaches that identify and focus on injection, capacity and containment risks. Reservoir simulation models can be adapted from oil and gas applications but further experimental work and code development are needed to quantify the role of major CO2 trapping mechanisms. Enhanced hydrocarbon recovery accompanying injection of CO2 is well established for CO2 EOR but its efficacy in EGR and ECBM is unclear. Well integrity, a key vulnerability in CO2 storage, should be addressed through modified well materials and construction approaches and cost effective remediation and intervention techniques. Field management issues, including risk assessment and monitoring, would benefit from development of accepted practices to apply through project lifecycle. Overall, the Workshop participants concluded that implementation of CCS, in a timely manner, represents a complex challenge that requires coordination of technical expertise, economic incentives, appropriate regulations and public acceptance. Storage assessment tools are available and adequate, although in need of refinement and standardization. Capture technology, however, requires more intense research aimed at new technologies and deep cost reduction. Infrastructure and regulatory development needs to reflect expectations and incentives from government bodies. Early implementation of CCS is expected to focus on the gas processing and other industries that produce high purity CO2 with storage in local hydrocarbon reservoirs or saline aquifers. Deployment at a scale required to substantially reduce CO2 atmospheric concentrations, however, would rely heavily on injection into saline formations and take decades of investment to build the extensive infrastructure required to capture and transport CO2 to injection sites. The ATW gathering was a unique, timely opportunity to engage experts in an assessment of the status and best path forward for CCS.

The optimism arises from the growing recognition that the developing world will be a major competitor for the limited and economically-available energy resources and from the increased awareness of the impacts of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel plants to global climate changes. New nuclear power plant orders are likely to grow and spread, to replace retiring nuclear units in the developed countries (e.g., the U.S.), to fuel activities in the fast growing economies (e.g. China and India), and to help raise the standard-of-living in the developing world. Others believe that past peaceful nuclear activities have resulted in serious, unsolved problems associated with aggravated proliferation concerns, thorny waste management and disposal challenges. One major area of concern is uranium enrichment and reprocessing facilities, which are integral to the commercial nuclear sector, but also can enable their users to make weapons. A number of initiatives have been proposed recently1 to allow for the growth and spread of nuclear power while limiting the justifications for additional countries to pursue the acquisition of enrichment or reprocessing capabilities. Most of these initiatives have fresh fuel assurance as a central component. The rationale is simple; if a country can have assurance that it will receive all the fresh fuel it needs for the lifetime of its nuclear power plants, there should be no reason for it to pursue the difficult and costly capability to enrich the fuel itself or to reprocess its spent fuel to recover the produced plutonium for recycle as a fuel in its reactors. However, such offers are unlikely to be fully persuasive if they are not connected to complementary offers for management of the spent nuclear fuel. Most countries have had issues associated with spent fuel storage and almost all have faced substantial problems in making progress on ultimate waste disposal, with or without reprocessing. The process of selecting appropriate deep geological repositories among several of these countries is now under way. Finland and Sweden are well advanced with plans and site selection for direct disposal of spent fuel. The US has opted for a final repository in Yucca Mountain, Nevada to dispose of 70,000 tonnes of spent fuel. The recent USDOE initiative on Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) includes research and development on advanced spent fuel reprocessing and burner- reactor concepts, and adds complexity to the dealing of the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle. In this paper, we discuss the issues associated with the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle including spent fuel take-back and the challenges and opportunities this may present to the countries' repository programs.",,"Energy costs; Global climate changes; Nuclear community; Nuclear power generation; Costs; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Energy policy; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847189966

At present, unemployment problem in the rural areas of the developing countries are diversifying the moral values and social responsibilities of unemployed youth. To solve the problem, rural development centres (involving vocational training, IT services and other productive activities) can contribute significantly for the upliftment of these rural youths and can transform them into grass-root entrepreneurs. One critical factor hindering the establishment of such rural development centers is access to affordable and reliable energy services. Under this backdrop, environmentally benign renewable energy systems can contribute significantly in providing much needed energy in the unserved or underserved rural development centers in the developing countries to achieve both local and global environmental benefits. The paper demonstrates that energy deficient, economically backward communities in the off-grid areas of the developing countries, can be given an array of opportunities for income generation and social progress through rural development centers with the aid of renewable energy sources (such as wind, solar photovoltaics, solar thermal, biomass and micro-hydro), thereby improving their standard of living. Poverty alleviation in rural areas can be accomplished and the critical role of access to adequate level of energy services, Information Technology (IT) and modern communication facilities in it demonstrated. Furthermore, the production, implementation, operation and maintenance of renewable energy applications being labor-intensive, will also result in job growth in the village context, preventing migration of labor force, especially of young men, from rural areas to overcrowded industrial areas. An appropriately designed renewable energy systems can also have a significant role in reducing the impact of climate change through non production of green house gases.

Optical transmittance-reflectance measurements, temperature dependent conductivity data and the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the heterostructure are analyzed to estimate device parameters, such as built-in potential, reverse saturation current density, intrinsic carrier concentration and donor concentration in the carbon side of the device for different P content in the target material for carbon. The estimated device parameters are seen to improve with the increase in P content in the target for up to 5% of P. But for 7% of P in the target, the device performance deteriorates. Using these device parameters, capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics of the device is simulated. The results are then compared with the experimentally obtained C- V characteristics.

Modeling provides a useful tool for investigating different parameters and comparing resultant emissions and fuel economy performance. An existing architectural concept has been tailored to a boosted hydrogen-enhanced lean-burn SI engine. The simulation consists of a set of Matlab models, part physical and part empirical, which has been developed to simulate a working engine. The model was calibrated with production engine data and experimental data taken at MIT. Combustion and emissions data come from a single cylinder research engine and include changes in air/fuel ratio, load and speed, and different fractions of the gasoline fuel reformed to H2 and CO. The outputs of the model are brake specific NOx emissions and brake specific fuel consumption maps along with cumulative NOx emissions and fuel economy for urban and highway drive cycles. Model results closely match production engine performance data for naturally aspirated stoichiometric operation. Simulation of lean boosted operation with 20% gasoline reformate fraction and 20% downsized displacement predicts a 23% improvement in fuel economy. Furthermore, part load engine-out NOx emissions are reduced by 83% compared to a baseline naturally aspirated stoichiometric production engine with 10% EGR dilution.

However, this constraint can be overcome by concurrent WGSR and carbonation (of calcium oxide) reaction to enhance H2 production. The carbonation of calcium oxide forming calcium carbonate incessantly drives the equilibrium-limited WGSR forward by removing the carbon dioxide (CO2) product from the reaction mixture. Calcium carbonate can be separately calcined to yield a pure CO2 stream for its subsequent sequestration and the calcium oxide recycled back. This calcium looping scheme not only improves the hydrogen yield and purity but also integrates a CO2 management scheme in the hydrogen production process while achieving near complete conversion of the carbon monoxide reactant.

By focusing on case studies representing the three main phases of Yeang's work, the impact of features such as core placement, sky courts, balconies, shading system and vegetation system are evaluated in terms of cooling and total energy use under the Malaysian climate. The climatic performances of the bioclimatic high-rise envelopes are then tested through comparisons with generic highrise forms. The study highlights the link between bioclimatic theories and climatic 'performances' and any conflicts between them. A paradox between theories based on critical regionalism and bioclimatic intentions are also described. Yeang's designs are then evaluated in terms of overall forms rather than separate components. The study then focuses on the debate on critical regionalism and sustainable design, the balance of modernization and traditional values within the context of developing cities, and the significance of bioclimatic and critical regionalist theories in forming the basis of a sustainable architecture appropriate to its cultural and climatic context.","Bioclimatic performance; Critical regionalism; Energy simulation; Sustainable theory; Tropical highrise","Bioclimatic performance; Critical regionalism; Energy simulation; High rise; Sustainable theory; Architecture; Environmental management; Tropics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865751696

Pyrolysis of crosslinked polymeric composites with Mg loadings between 10 and 50 wt.% was carried out in argon atmosphere at temperatures up to 1600 °C. The metal-precursor reactions, ceramization and phase evolution were studied using thermogravimetry, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Predominantly X-ray amorphous Mg-Si-C-N materials, containing up to 15 mol% Mg, were obtained at 1000 °C, with a homogeneous distribution of magnesium at a length scale above 100 nm. The incorporation of Mg in the materials proceeds in two steps: (i) conversion of the Mg metal to magnesium compounds and (ii) solid state diffusion, assisted by vapour phase transport, of Mg into the amorphous Si-C-N-H bulk. Mg retention in the materials at temperatures above 900 °C is realized due to the formation of Si-Mg-N bonds. Primary crystallization of SiC is initiated by magnesium induced partitioning of nitrogen in the Mg-Si-C-N materials. Stability of the amorphous Mg-Si-C-N phase and crystallization of MgSiN2 at higher pyrolysis temperatures is governed by the free carbon content in the materials and the nitrogen partial pressure in the thermolysis atmosphere. The results indicate the feasibility of synthesizing monolithic MgSiN2-based ceramics through precursor pyrolysis. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006.",,"Infrared spectroscopy; Powder metals; Pyrolysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); Thermogravimetric analysis; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction analysis; Homogeneous distribution; Phase evolution; Silazane precursor; Ceramic materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749340586

Several governmental organizations have suggested the need of more stringent regulating scheme for reducing and controlling HAPs emission in the country. Major industrial emission sources of HAPs have been identified and the prioritized industries were chosen to investigate in details by surveying management and emission status. They included combustion facilities of municipal waste combustor (MWC), polymer manufacturing, petroleum industries, etc. The existing regulation and management guidelines for subject industries in Korea were summarized and compared with US MACT regulations. Based on the results of on-site sampling and measurement, the appropriate guidelines for such industries were suggested. One of the object facilities was a MWC, thus this presentation will introduce summarized result of attempts to utilize MACT to Korean MWCs management. First, the details of US MACT rule, 40 CFR Part 60, for large MWCs was summarized and compared with the existing Korean regulations. Second, several general facts (i.e., incineration capacity, waste composition, air pollution control devices arrangement, etc,) were surveyed and the performance of facilities was investigated. Third, stack sampling was carried out to measure air pollutants that should be considered. Measured HAPs mainly included dioxin/furan, mercury, heavy metals, particulate, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The sampling of particulate and heavy metals was made by the Korean methods. Mercury sampling and analysis were carried out by Ontario Hydro Method. VOCs sampling and analysis were done using US EPA methods. Finally, the draft guidelines to regulate MWCs were suggested and will be proposed to formulate the future regulation.","Hazardous air pollutants; Municipal waste combustor; US MACT","Air pollution control; Industrial emissions; Laws and legislation; Regulatory compliance; Waste treatment; Hazardous air pollutants; Municipal waste; Municipal waste combustor (MWC); Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947421670

These fungi facilitate plant nutrient uptake, promote soil aggregation and use a significant portion of reduced carbon from the plants. AMF functional traits differ considerably among and within species, meaning that functional properties of a mycorrhizal community depend on its composition. Here we review studies exploring the effects of agricultural practices such as tillage, crop rotation, fertilization, pesticide application, irrigation and grazing on AMF communities. Although it is difficult to generalize the results of studies performed under different soil and climatic conditions, some universal patterns emerge. For example, soil tillage reduces the abundance of Scutellospora spp.; phosphorus fertilization lowers the extent of AMF root colonization; and diversification of crops results in more diverse AMF communities. We now need to design simple and reliable field tests for quantifying the effects of AMF communities on crop growth, yields and sustainability of the agro-ecosystems. © The Geological Society of London 2006.",,"agricultural ecosystem; agricultural practice; arbuscular mycorrhiza; climate effect; community composition; crop rotation; crop yield; fertilizer application; fungus; grazing; irrigation; nutrient uptake; pesticide application; tillage; Arbuscular; Embryophyta; Fungi; Scutellospora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847369754

Epidemiological associations between the mortality and morbidity of urban populations and ambient air pollution monitoring data are routinely called health effects of outdoor air exposure, which has created false interpretations: that the same air pollutants when originating from indoor sources are of lesser health importance, or that the observed health effects are due to exposure the while outdoors. Further confusion has been created by counterarguments that outdoor air pollution matters little, because we spend over 90% of our times indoors. True, but misleading because much - for some contaminants most - of the indoor air pollution comes from outdoor air. A pragmatic approach to indoor air exposure focuses on air pollution exposure and risk management: The overall impact of buildings, building equipment and management, indoor materials and activities on exposure to air pollution. Managing of the risks from indoor air exposure should therefore focus both on elimination and dilution of the contaminants from indoor sources, and protection from outdoor air pollution. The latter can be advanced by isolating indoor microenvironments from outdoor air pollution, but also by reducing outdoor air pollution. Buildings do not only protect from outdoor air, they also contaminate it - directly and indirectly. The direct impacts come from the energy efficiency, heating system of and fuel selection for the buildings. Built urban environments, however, modify their environments also by other means than exhausting flue gases and wastewater. For the same effective residence and work space, different urban plans require vastly different land areas and generate different forms and quantities of traffic. These environmental effects of the entire building stock and consequent urban infrastructure may, overwhelm all the direct and obvious impacts that an individual building has for the air pollution exposure of its occupants.","Exposure; Indoor air pollution; Indoor sources; Urban infrastructure; Ventilation and infiltration","Air contaminants; Air pollutants; Air pollution exposures; Ambient air pollution; Building stocks; Direct impact; Exposure; Fuel selection; Health effects; Heating system; Indoor air; Indoor environment; Indoor materials; Indoor microenvironments; Indoor sources; Land areas; Outdoor air; Outdoor air pollution; Urban environments; Urban infrastructure; Urban population; Work space; Buildings; Contamination; Energy efficiency; Flue gases; Health; Population statistics; Risk management; Indoor air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349062942

In the derivative version of adaptive critic designs, the derivative of the cost function of dynamic programming with respect to the state of the process is estimated. As the goal of dynamic programming is to maximize the overall cost function, direct estimation of the cost function derivatives will naturally lead to better algorithm performance. In our previous studies of the regular version of adaptive critic techniques, a model of the process for controller training was not necessary. However, for the implementation of the ""derivative"" version of adaptive critic designs, a process model in the form of neural network is required. In this way, the derivative information can be propagated back to the controller in order to update the controller parameters. The objectives of the present learning control design for automotive engines are to improve performance, reduce emissions and maintain optimum performance under various operating conditions. Using data from the test vehicle equipped with a 5.3L V8 engine, we built a neural network model of the engine. The model is then used in the development of self-learning neural network controllers based on the idea of approximate dynamic programming to achieve optimal control for both engine torque and exhaust air-fuel ratio control. The goals of the engine torque and air-fuel ratio control are to track the commanded torque and to regulate the air-fuel ratio at specified set-points, respectively. For both control problems, reasonably good neural network controller transient performance under a wide range of operating conditions have been achieved and reported. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Automotive fuels; Cost functions; Dynamic programming; Neural networks; Air-fuel ratio; Self-learning engine control; Heuristic methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40649113421

We should, therefore, be especially concerned about the possible effects of EDCs on the ability of Arctic marine mammals and seabirds to adapt to environmental alterations caused by climate change. Relationships between various organochlorine compounds, necessary such as polychlorinated biphenyls, dichlorophenyldichloroethylene, hexachlorobenzene, and oxychlordane, and hormones in Arctic mammals and seabirds imply that these chemicals pose a threat to endocrine systems of these animals. The most pronounced relationships have been reported with the thyroid hormone system, but effects are also seen in sex steroid hormones and cortisol. Even though behavioral and morphological effects of persistent organic pollutants are consistent with endocrine disruption, no direct evidence exists for such relationships. Because different endocrine systems are important for enabling animals to respond adequately to environmental stress, EDCs may interfere with adaptations to increased stress situations. Such interacting effects are likely related to adaptive responses regulated by the thyroid, sex steroid, and glucocorticosteroid systems.","Glaucous gull; Haliocherus; Larus hyperboreus; PBDEs; PCB; Polar bears; POPs; Seal; Ursus maritimus","endocrine disruptor; animal; Arctic; bird; climate; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; mammal; physiology; pollutant; review; Animals; Arctic Regions; Birds; Climate; Ecosystem; Endocrine Disruptors; Environmental Pollutants; Greenhouse Effect; Mammals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748852243

The decoupling between δ 13C and MARs after 5 Ma probably indicates a dominance of dissolution over carbonate production. Therefore, the coincidence in δ 13C excursions with the stages of sharp reduction in CaCO 3 MARs during the carbonate crash points to a causative mechanism induced by surface circulation-induced low productivity. We speculate that the major middle/late Miocene sea level drop may have caused the complete closure of the Indonesian Seaway. We propose a model wherein the blockage of Indonesian Throughflow would have resulted in a piling-up of surface warm water in the west Pacific, thereby strengthening the Equatorial Undercurrent system. The eastward spread of this nutrient-poor water then warmed sea-surface temperature and reduced upwelling in the central and eastern Pacific, reducing in turn biological productivity of phytoplankton. A coincident reduction in Central America and circum-Caribbean volcanism plus the deflection of the delivery of volcanic ash as a result of the then prevailing southeastern trade winds across the equator further deprived these regions of trace element nutrients, which added to lowered surface water carbonate production. Surface water warming and reduced upwelling is documented by negative excursions in δ 18O values.

The options considered for the infrastructure are production from natural gas or electricity at the refuelling site, from natural gas or municipal waste within London using short distribution pipelines, and large-scale production from natural gas, distributed in liquid form. These results show that while renewable electrolysis is the only zero-emission pathway considered, all of the hydrogen pathways would lead to significant reduction in the emission of nitrous oxides and particulates, compared to the diesel fleet. The pathway with the lowest CO2 emissions, other than renewable electrolysis, is production via the gasification of waste, which results in a 75% reduction in CO2 emissions. All three natural gas pathways would yield some improvement compared to the diesel fleet, though grid electrolysis would increase CO2 emissions.

The approach anticipates that decision makers will be interested in answers to the following questions: (1) Is SZNA occurring and what processes are contributing to SZNA? (2) What are the current rates of mass removal associated with SZNA? (3) What are the longer-term implications of SZNA for ground water impacts? and (4) Are the SZNA processes and rates sustainable? This approach is a data-driven, macroscopic, multiple-lines-of-evidence approach and is therefore consistent with the 2000 National Research Council's recommendations and complementary to existing dissolved plume natural attenuation protocols and recent modeling work published by others. While this work is easily generalized, the discussion emphasizes SZNA assessment at petroleum hydrocarbon spill sites. The approach includes three basic levels of data collection and data reduction (Group I, Group II, and Group III). Group I measurements provide evidence that SZNA is occurring. Group II measurements include additional information necessary to estimate current SZNA rates, and group III measurements are focused on evaluating the long-term implications of SZNA for source zone characteristics and ground water quality. This paper presents the generalized site-specific SZNA assessment approach and then focuses on the interpretation of Group II data.

There is a strong series of arguments in support of the view that the free allocation of allowances under the various national allocation plans (NAPs) involves an element of State aid, which has neither been formally notified to, nor cleared by, the Commission under the EC Treaty. Even if it is found properly to have been notified, there are serious doubts as to whether the extent of aid granted satisfies the proportionality principle. As a result, the operation of the EU ETS may be subject to some legal uncertainty with regard to possible legal challenges to the current allocation of allowances. Going forward, proposals to amend the operation of the EU ETS must take into account similar State aid considerations (particularly proportionality) and the experience gained from the working of the EU ETS in phase I. The structural outline of a possible legislative package has been suggested, which could achieve the safeguarding of commercial and legal certainty under the current allocation regime, while at the same time providing a basis for amendment of the allocation mechanism under the EU ETS for phase II and beyond. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Competition; EC law; Emissions trading; European Union; Law; State aid","emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental legislation; environmental planning; environmental policy; European Union",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747764200

The Cactus House occupies a portion of a much larger structure located in close proximity to Mary's Well and the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation. Excavations in the basement of Cactus revealed a portion of a hypocaust and furnace of a bath house. Radiocarbon results date the present bath house (in the basement of the store), excavated by the owners, to the Crusader period. The lower yet-to-be excavated archaeological site is hypothesized to be a Roman bath house which would have been where Jesus and his family would have bathed. The objective of the geophysical surveys was to gather, in a non-intrusive and non-destructive manner, as much information as possible about underlying features of the excavated portion of the bath house as well as surrounding locations. GPR data was collected in 3 localities within the Cactus House and 3 sites adjacent and behind the House. The data was collected using a pulseEKKO 1000 GPR system (225 & 450 MHz antennae; 200 V transmitter). Step sizes ranged from 0.05 m to 0.1 m. To aid in interpretation, three dimensional (3D) cubes were assembled from a series of identical length 2D GPR profiles running parallel to each other along an x-y grid system. The 3D cubes provide a unique perspective of the subsurface layers that will aid in locating sites for excavation. The application of radar stratigraphic analysis on the collected data provided the framework from which to investigate both lateral and vertical geometry of any potentially buried archaeological features. The resulting images from these geophysical surveys show that various anomalies exist in the subsurface and may indicate archaeological features exist below the present floors. For example, the upper bath house may have been built upon an earlier bath house that more closely aligns with the water system located and excavated at the adjacent Mary's Well site. Several test probes and samples for radiocarbon dating are planned to be undertaken based upon the results from these geophysical surveys.",,"Excavation; Floors; Geological surveys; Geophysics; Ground penetrating radar systems; Houses; Software architecture; Stratigraphy; Archaeological features; Archaeological site; Geophysical surveys; Ground penetrating radar (GPR); Radiocarbon dating; Stratigraphic analysis; Subsurface layer; Threedimensional (3-d); Geophysical prospecting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866040274

In spite of the growing importance of event tourism to many communities in Canada and the US, research examining the influence of current weather and climate on event planning, or event tourism more broadly, is very limited. Consequently, the potential implications of climate change for event planning and tourism has yet to be explored. This article presents the findings of the first known assessment of climate change on event tourism in North America. A case study of Canada's National Capital Region was used to better understand the current impact of weather and climate on three high-profile outdoor events planned by the National Capital Commission (NCC) (Winterlude, the Canadian Tulip Festival, and Canada Day celebrations), and to assess the potential impact of climate change on the NCC's long-term event planning. Climate change is projected to have a meaningful impact on the success of some special events by altering the ability of the NCC to maintain ice-based attractions (skating on the Rideau Canal Skateway), changing tulip phenology to cause a mismatch with current Festival dates, and increasing the need for heat emergency planning during Canada Day. Possible adaptation strategies to respond to the challenges of climate change are also discussed, as are some general implications for event management. Copyright © 2006 Cognizant Comm.

Emissions of ozone precursors from Europe (NOx, CO and nonmethane hydrocarbons) have been substantially reduced over the last 10-15 years, but changes in ozone levels cannot be explained by changes in European emissions alone. The observed ozone trends at many European sites are only partially reproduced by global or regional photochemistry models, and possible reasons for this are discussed. In order to further explain the European trends in ozone since 1990, the EMEP regional photochemistry model has been run for the years 1990 and 1995-2002. The EMEP model is a regional model centred over Europe but the model domain also includes most of the North Atlantic and the polar region. Climatological ozone data are used as initial and lateral boundary concentrations. Model results are compared to measurements over this timespan of 12 years. Possible causes for the measured trends in European surface ozone have been investigated using model sensitivity runs perturbing emissions and lateral boundary concentrations. The increase in winter ozone partially, and the decrease in the magnitude of high ozone episodes, is attributed to the decrease in ozone precursor emissions since 1990 by the model. Furthermore, the model calculations indicate that the emission reductions have resulted in a marked decrease in summer ozone in major parts of Europe, in particular in Germany. Such a trend in summer ozone is likely to be difficult to identify from the measurements alone because of large inter-annual variability. © 2006 Author(s).

The model was used in a case study aimed at improving the performance (mpg) of a basic hybrid vehicle. The assessment model and case study included a gap analysis, a scouting report for candidate technologies, a technology evaluation and selection model, implementation recommendations, and a diffusion and adoption analysis. Hybrid vehicles are a radical innovation in vehicle manufacturing that can potentially reduce the amount of carbon emissions associated with ""mainstream"" vehicles. At 50 mpg on the highway, the hybrid performance was equal to non-hybrid performances of lightweight diesel and gas-powered vehicles. The performance declined to approximately 35 mpg in the city when accessories like the air-conditioner or heater were used or the windows were left down and the engine cycled on and off due to frequent start-stop cycles. We focused on improving the performance of the vehicle during the first gallon of gas consumption by adding or swapping components such as batteries, battery chargers, fuel cells, and efficient engines, electrical motors and generators. The improved performance was accomplished by charging the batteries overnight and operating the vehicle in a purely electric-vehicle mode before the engine started. Doubling the mass of NiMH batteries extended the EV-mode range. These two changes together extended the performance range in the city and on the highway. Actual performance of any vehicle is driver and path dependent.

To respond to such challenges, the Ministry of the Environment of the Republic of Korea enacted the Special Act on Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement (SAMAQI) in December 2003. The Special Act is effective from January 2005. Because the transport sector is rapidly growing in the Seoul metropolitan area, we discuss the possible impact of this Special Act on emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the transport sector in Seoul. For this policy analysis, the AIM/local model (Asia-Pacific Integrated Model for Evaluating Policy Options to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emission and Global Warming Impacts) is used. SAMAQI is expected to affect the emission profiles of air pollutants in the Seoul metropolitan area with the introduction of diesel passenger cars. This article analyzes the various policy scenarios along with projections of key determinants in the transport sector in this area. With such stringent emission standards and other policies and measures envisioned by the Special Act, the introduction of new vehicles equipped with advanced technologies and energy efficiency improvements will be accelerated, which will contribute to the reduction of air pollutants and CO2 emissions simultaneously. © 2006, Springer Japan.","AIM/local model; Alternative scenarios; Korea; Local pollutant emissions; Transport",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919932285

It provides both mean values and perturbations for density, temperature, pressure, and winds, as well as monthly and geographically varying trace constituent concentrations. From 0 to 27 km, GRAM thermodynamics and winds are based on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Upper Air Climatic Atlas (GUACA) climatology. Above 120 km, GRAM is based on the NASA Marshall engineering thermosphere (MET) model. In the intervening altitude region, GRAM is based on middle atmosphere program (MAP) climatology that also forms the basis of the 1986 COSPAR International reference atmosphere (CIRA). Atmospheric composition is represented in GRAM by concentrations of both major and minor species. Above 120 km, MET provides concentration values for N 2 , O 2 , Ar, O, He, and H. Below 120 km, represented species also include H 2 O, O 3 , N 2 O, CO, CH 4 , and CO 2 . At 34th COSPAR a comparison was made between GRAM constituents below 120 km and those provided by Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) climatology. No current need to update GRAM constituent climatology in that height range was identified. This report examines GRAM/MET constituents between 100 and 1000 km altitudes. Internal discrepancies are noted between GRAM/MET constituent number densities and mass density or molecular weight. Near 110 km altitude, there is up to about 25% discrepancy between MET number density and mass density (with mass density being valid and number densities requiring adjustment). Near 700 km altitude there is also up to about 25% discrepancy between MET number density and mean molecular weight (with molecular weight requiring adjustment). In neither case are MET mass density estimates invalidated. The discrepancies have been traced to MET subroutines SLV (which affects 90-170 km height range) and SLVH (which affects helium above 440 km altitude). With these discrepancies corrected, results are presented to illustrate GRAM/MET constituent mole fractions in terms of height-latitude cross-sections from 100 to 1000 km altitude, and latitude-longitude ""maps"" at 450 km. Plans are discussed for an update of MET and GRAM to correct these constituent inconsistencies, and to incorporate several new thermospheric model features. © 2006 COSPAR.","Air density model; Atmospheric models; GRAM-99","Atmospheric density; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climatology; Perturbation techniques; Air density model; Atmospheric models; Mole fractions; Thermospheric models; Earth atmosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751253757

For electric load variation, only photovoltaic (PV) system alternatives are significantly considered as the source of uncertainty electric generation. We develop the model of PV-type alternatives into two types as battery-less and battery-installed system alternatives. The electric load variations are calculated based on actual data of solar radiation.

This unfavourable situation results in the operation of high cost autonomous thermal power stations and the transportation of fresh water of questionable quality at extremely high prices. Wind energy can definitely contribute on solving these problems at a rational investment and operational cost. To face the intermittent and stochastic wind behaviour, a combined wind-hydro configuration is proposed in collaboration with an appropriate desalination plant. The proposed solution leads to high wind energy penetration rates and bounds the operational hours of the existing internal combustion engines, additionally contributing to the air pollution reduction. Besides, significant water quantities can be produced, remarkably reinforcing the water reserves of the local community with fresh water of desired quality. Consequently, the configuration investigated can efficiently fulfil the electrical energy and the clean water requirements of numerous remote communities on the basis of clean and low cost wind energy, overcoming the intermittent and stochastic behaviour of the wind.

The studies aimed at performing a realistic approach of the energy penalty due to the integration of CO2 capture in IGCC power plants as well as a realistic evaluation of the transport and storage costs taking into account the topography for the CO2 transport pipeline and the reservoir characteristics for the CO2 storage. In this work we assumed two hypothetical 1 GW coal IGCC power plants, one close to the inland French city of Metz and the other one close to the city of Nantes in the French Atlantic cost. This corresponds to a traditional localization for coal power plants in France, but does not necessarily constitute the optimal situation wim respect to the storage zones of CO2 and to the constraints of fuel supply. Two options for the IGCC are considered, one consisting of 3 × 340 MW IGCC units of the Puertollano type termed as 'classical', each IGCC unit is based on one train of gasifier fed with dry coal operated at 27 bar integrated to a 53% efficiency combined cycle. The second option considers a more 'advanced' IGCC which consists of two trains of Texaco quench gasifier fed with slurry containing 64% mass of coal and 36% mass of water operated at 64 bar integrated to a 60% efficiency combined cycle with two trains of H technology gas turbine, two trains of heat recovery steam generator and one steam turbine. This latter IGCC system could deliver 1200 MWe IGCC with a single unit. Concerning the CO2 capture, six physical and chemical absorption processes were modelled with the Aspen Plus™ software. After a selection based on energy performances three processes were selected and studied in detail: two physical processes based on methanol and Selexol™ solvents, and a chemical process using activated MDEA. For 'advanced' IGCC operating at high pressure only physical processes are assessed, methanol. Concerning the CO2 transport we only selected the 'pipeline' option even for offshore geological storage as the 'ship' option seems more expensive for short distance offshore transport. On the other hand, concerning the storage, several types of reservoirs were considered: storage in depleted oil or gas fields and storage in deep aquifers. In the case of deep aquifers we also evaluate the potential influence of CO2 quantity to be sequestered (varying from 5 to 50 Mt/year) on the cost of the transport and storage equipments. Detailed study on transport and storage is given in reference [11]. The economic evaluation shows that the total cost of base load electricity produced in France by coal IGCC power plants with CO2 capture and storage could reach Euros 63/MWh with 'classical' IGCC and Euros 58/MWh with advanced IGCC. This is almost one and half the production cost achieved by a 600 MW supercritical pulverised coal unit fully equipped with flue gas treatment but without the CO2 capture. The cost per tonne of avoided CO2 is evaluated at about 53.5 Euros with 'classical' IGCC and 48.9 Euros with 'advanced' IGCC. These high values should be interpreted cautiously, firstly because 'advanced' IGCC designs could reduce the energy penalty of CO2 capture in future plants, and secondly because the transport and storage costs are strongly depending upon the distance from the power plants, the quantity of CO2 transported, the presence of a collecting CO2 network if any and the storage characteristics (permeability, depth, type of reservoirs, on-shore or off-shore location). Favourable projects location with optimised technology could lead to lower costs but, if the characteristics of the reservoirs are worse than estimated and if stringent regulations (unclear today) are set up for CO2 transport and storage this could also lead to higher costs.","Avoided CO2; CO2 capture; Coal; MDEA; Methanol; Power plant; Slurry","Carbon dioxide; Electricity; Methanol; Power plants; Research and development management; Carbon dioxide capture; Flue gas treatment; Gasification",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748925326

The significance of the observed intercamera variability was determined by comparing it to the intracamera (i.e., within a single camera) variability. Measurements of performance characteristics were based on the standards of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association and reports 6, 9, 22, and 52 from the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. All measurements were performed using 99mTc (except 57Co used for extrinsic resolution) and low-energy, high-resolution collimation. Of the nine cameras, four have crystals 3/8 in. thick and five have crystals 5/8 in. thick. We evaluated intrinsic energy resolution, intrinsic and extrinsic spatial resolution, intrinsic integral and differential flood uniformity over the useful field-of-view, count rate at 20% count loss, planar sensitivity, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) resolution, and SPECT integral uniformity. The intracamera variability was estimated by repeated measurements of the performance characteristics on a single system. The significance of the observed intercamera variability was evaluated using the two-tailed F distribution. The planar sensitivity of the gamma cameras tested was found be variable at the 99.8% confidence level for both the 3/8-in. and 5/8-in. crystal systems. The integral uniformity and energy resolution were found to be variable only for the 5/8-in. crystal systems at the 98% and 90% confidence level, respectively. All other performance characteristics tested exhibited no significant variability between camera systems. The measured variability reported here could perhaps be used to define nominal performance values of Symbia gamma cameras for planar and SPECT imaging. © 2006 Am. Coll. Med.

The project focus on prediction horizons up to 48 hours ahead and investigates predictability of wind for higher horizons up to 7 days ahead useful i.e. for maintenance scheduling. Emphasis is given on the integration of high-resolution meteorological forecasts. Specific modules are also developed for on-line uncertainty and prediction risk estimation. An integrated software platform, 'ANEMOS', is developed to host the various models. This system is installed by several end-users for on-line operation at onshore and offshore wind farms for prediction at a local, regional and national scale.

ONLEM deals with online-calculated emissions, i.e., emissions that are calculated during the simulation. The submodel TNUDGE uses the ""tracer nudging"" technique for pseudo-sources and -sinks. For species with highly uncertain emission fluxes and/or with sufficiently long lifetimes, e.g., CH 4, it is common to create such pseudofluxes by prescribing the observed mixing ratio of the species at a given boundary (e.g., the mixing ratio of methane at the surface, or the ozone mixing ratio at the tropopause). All three submodels substantially simplify the inclusion of emissions into a model. Specific emissions can easily be switched on or off. New prescribed emissions can be included without rewriting any code. New online emissions only require one additional subroutine containing the new parameterization. A major advantage is that input fields at arbitrary resolution can be used. The problem of incompatible grids between emission data and model is overcome by utilizing the MESSy data import interface. To further simplify the creation of new offline emission data, the preprocessing program EDGAR2NC is provided. EDGAR2NC transforms files from the EDGAR format into the netCDF format which is required by OFFLEM. The presented routines are a part of the community modeling project MESSy and can be made available for use to the atmospheric modeling community.",,"atmospheric modeling; emission; parameterization; simulation; software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748286843

One attractive feature of the CDM is that unlike other emerging carbon trading schemes it offers a means to promote sustainable development, which in a poor country must include providing poor people with income-earning opportunities. In practice however, the CDM projects may fail to address four issues key to this possibility: ownership, price, transaction costs, and use rights. The failure to address these issues ultimately could lead the CDMto benefit elite landowners at the expense of the poor. However, recognition of this oversight provides opportunities to work with poor communities worldwide to facilitate the collective action required to make the CDM work for them.

In this study, a single zone, zero dimensional, thermo-kinetic model has been developed and a computer program with MATLAB software is used to predict engine performance characteristics. This model has been used to predict the principal parameters of controlling auto-ignition to acceptable level and this work leads to achieving the working region with two limitations for knock and misfire. The cycle is simulated with premixed blend of methane and DME with air. To highlight the importance of using HCCI engines instead of conventional diesel engines, an ISO continuous operation cycle (COP) and prime power cycle (PRP) has been investigated.

The engine was operated at a constant speed for six steady-state engine operations ranging from idle to rated power. The solid particle size distributions were mainly monomodal lognormal distributions in nature reflecting a typical soot agglomerate size distribution with a number mean diameter in the size range from 98 nm to 37 nm as the load decreases from high to low. At idle, M6, however, the solid particle distribution was bimodal in nature with a high number of solid nanoparticles in the sub-20 nm size range. It is likely that these solid particles nucleated later in the combustion process from metallic ash typically present in the lube oil. The total particle size distributions exhibited a bimodal structure only at light load, M5, engine operation, where a high number of volatile nanoparticles were observed. The rest of the operating conditions exhibited monomodal distributions although the nature of the particles was vastly different. For the medium load modes, M2, M3, and M4, the particles were mainly solid particles. For the rated power, Ml, and idle, M6, modes of engine operation, significant number of volatile particles grew to a size nearing that of soot particles making the distribution monomodal, similar to that of a solid particle distribution. This shows that monomodal distributions are not necessarily solid particle but they can be strongly dominated with volatile particles if significant particle growth takes place like the case at M1, and M6. The total number and mass concentration were extremely high at engine rated power. The number concentration exceeded 1.2 billion particles per cubic centimeter and the mass exceeded 750 milligrams per cubic meter. The number concentration is more than five orders of magnitude higher than a typical ambient level concentration, and the mass concentration is more than four orders of magnitude higher. It is important to indicate, however, that if the engine power rating is lowered by 35 percent from its designated level, both particle mass and number emissions will be reduced by two orders of magnitude. By measuring total and solid particle size and number concentration of particles, one can calculate other metrics such as surface area and mass to provide detail information about particle emissions. Such information can serve as an important database where all metrics of particle emissions are captured.

The semi-closed Brayton cycle is called the High Pressure Regenerative Turbine Engine (HPRTE). The VARS interacts with the HPRTE power cycle through heat exchange in the generator and the evaporator. Waste heat from the recirculated combustion gas of the HPRTE is used to power the absorption refrigeration unit, which cools the high-pressure compressor inlet of the HPRTE to below ambient conditions and also produces excess refrigeration in an amount which depends on ambient conditions. Water produced as a product of combustion is intentionally condensed in the evaporator of the VARS, which is designed to provide sufficient cooling for the inlet air to the high pressure compressor, water extraction, and for an external cooling load. The computer model of the combined HPRTE/VARS cycle predicts that with steam blade cooling and a medium-sized engine, the cycle will have a thermal efficiency of 49% for a turbine inlet temperature of 1400°C. This thermal efficiency is in addition to the large external cooling load generated in the combined cycle which is 13% of the net work output. In addition it also produces up to 1.4 kg of water for each kg of fuel consumed, depending upon the fuel type. When the combined HPRTE/VARS cycle is optimized for maximum thermal efficiency, the optimum occurs for a broad range of operating conditions. Details of the multivariate optimization procedure and results are presented in the paper. Previous studies have demonstrated the following attributes of the combined HPRTE/VARS cycle: attaining high part power efficiency in a compact package, three-fold specific power increase over the state of the art, reduced IR signatures due to lower exhaust temperature, significant reduction of exhaust partkulates and smoke, constant high pressure compressor inlet temperature and order-of-magnitude reductions in emissions such as NOx, CO and unburned hydrocarbons. The integrated nature of this system allows overall reduction in size and weight of approximately 50% relative to conventional equipment. The combination of positive attributes makes the HPRTE combined cycle engine attractive for future mobile power applications in terms of performance as well as life cycle cost.",,"Brayton cycle; Compressors; Extraction; Heating; Refrigeration; Turbines; High Pressure Regenerative Turbine Engine (HPRTE); Steam blades; Thermal efficiency; Vapor Absorption Refrigeration System (VARS); Cooling systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751418352

For the familiar 2-class detection problem (signal present/absent), ideal (and approximately ideal) observers have been applied to optimization of pinhole and collimator parameters in planar emission imaging. Such experiments, albeit with rather simple imaging systems, yield insights as to the roles played by Poisson data noise and object noise (i.e. stochastic background and signal variabilities) in system design. In this work, we consider a fundamentally different task in which the observer is required to both detect and localize a signal. This task is more clinically realistic than detection only, and it is natural to inquire whether the addition of a localization requirement changes conclusions on system design. We have previously formulated an optimal decision strategy and associated ideal observer for this joint detection/localization task, and here we apply it to the classic problem of determining an optimal pinhole diameter in a planar imaging system. We conclude that as the allowed search tolerance on the localization task decreases, the optimal pinhole size shrinks from that required by detection alone. However, as background variability increases, the optimal pinhole sizes for detection only and detection + localization approach one another. © 2006 IEEE.","Ideal observer; Lesion detection; LROC; Pinhole; Planar emission imaging; ROC","Optical collimators; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Poisson equation; Random processes; Systems analysis; Ideal observers; Lesion detection; Planar emission imaging; Poisson data noise; Imaging systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38649110194

In addition, climatological studies have also revealed multi-decadal epochs of distinct climate states across eastern Australia. Within these multi-decadal epochs significant variability exists in the magnitude and frequency of ENSO impacts resulting in elevated (or reduced depending on the climate state) risk of extreme events such as floods, bushfires and droughts. Given that ENSO events can now be detected several months prior to their peakimpact period, the opportunity exists to use climate variability insights to more accurately predict the chance of climate related emergencies occurring in the forthcoming season or year.

Due to their seasonal growth cycle and annual replacement, antlers constitute ""naturally standardized"" environmental samples whose analysis allows an assessment of the exposure of deer to environmental pollutants with an affinity to mineralized tissues. Historical biomonitoring studies conducted in Germany revealed a marked drop in lead and fluoride concentrations in antlers of roe and red deer in the 1980s and 1990s compared with the 1950s to 1970s, indicating a pronounced reduction of atmospheric deposition of lead and fluoride into the habitats. This is attributed to the phase-out of leaded gasoline and the resulting reduction of lead-emissions from motor traffic and to a decrease of lead and fluoride emissions from stationary sources due to improved emission control measures. In addition, regional differences in lead and fluoride exposure of deer could be demonstrated based on the analysis of roe deer antlers collected during the same period (1990s). There is some evidence that exposure of deer to above-normal levels of fluoride causes an impairment of mineralization in antler bone.","Antlers; Bioindication; Biomonitoring; Bone mineralization; Environmental pollution","Capreolus; Capreolus capreolus; Cervidae; Cervus elaphus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846144716

Yet, the evolutionary stability of mycorrhizal associations is still poorly understood, as it follows none of the constraints thought to stabilize cooperation in other well-known mutualisms. The capacity of both host and symbiont to simultaneously interact with several partners introduces a unique dilemma; detecting and punishing those exploiting the mutualism becomes increasingly difficult if these individuals can continue to access resources from alternative sources. Here, we explore four hypotheses to explain evolutionary cooperation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis: (1) pseudo-vertical transmission and spatial structuring of plant and fungal populations leading to local adaptation of partners; (2) luxury resource exchange in which plants trade surplus carbon for excess fungal nutrients; (3) partner choice allowing partners to associate with better cooperators; and (4) host and symbiont sanctions which actively reward good partners and punish less cooperative ones. We propose that mycorrhizal cooperation is promoted by an exchange of surplus resources between partners and enforced through sanctions by one or both partners. These mechanisms may allow plant and fungal genotypes to discriminate against individuals employing exploitative strategies, promoting patterns of partner choice.

Emission characteristics of the engine are investigated using injectors that have different included spray angles, ranging from 50 to 130 degrees. The engine was operated under PCCI conditions featuring early injection times, high EGR levels and high intake temperatures. The Representative Interactive Flamelet (RIF) model was used with the KIVA code for combustion and emission modeling. Modeling results show that spray targeting plays an important role in determining the in-cylinder mixture distributions, which in turn affect the resulting pollutant emissions. High soot emissions are observed for injection conditions that result in locally fuel rich regions due to spray impingement normal to the piston surface. Soot emissions can be reduced if the injection angle and timing can be better coordinated with squish flows and/or spray-induced flows to prevent the formation of fuel rich regions. In general, a soot and NOx trade-off is observed with respect to the start-of-injection timing. The unburned hydrocarbon and CO are found to reside in the same regions as high soot concentrations. This indicates that the sources of CO and HC are the incomplete combustion of fuel rich mixture in the present HSDI diesel engine.

Measurement of physical and dielectric properties of the reactive sputtered Ta2O5 as two forms of simple MOS structure, states that the amorphous Ta2O5 grown on Ti gave high dielectric constant (∼r=30-70) and high leakage current (10 -1-10-4A/cm2), whereas relatively low dielectric constant (∼10) and low leakage current (∼10-10 A/cm2) were observed in the amorphous Ta2O5 deposited on the Ti-O2. As a result, the Ta2O 5/Ti capacitor exhibits three dominant conduction mechanism regimes contributed by the ohmic emission at low electrical field, by the Schottky emission at intermediate field and by the Poole-Frenkel emission at high field.

The CHEMKIN code was implemented into an updated KIVA-3V release 2 code to simulate combustion and emission characteristics using reduced chemistry. The test engine used for validation data was a single cylinder version of a production 1.9L four-cylinder HSDI diesel engine. The engine operating condition considered was 2,000 rev/min and 5 bar BMEP load. Because high EGR levels are required for combustion retardation to make PCI combustion possible, the EGR rate was set at a relatively high level (40%) and injection timing sweeps were considered. Since injection timings were very advanced, impingement of the fuel spray on the piston bowl wall was unavoidable. To model the effects of fuel films on exhaust emissions, a drop and wall interaction model was implemented in the present code. The simulation results showed good levels of agreement with the measured in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate and exhaust emissions. Also, optimum injection timings were revealed using both simulation and experimental methods. As the injection timing was advanced from 15o BTDC to 51 o BTDC, distinct regions of emission characteristics controlled by mixing and the combustion bowl geometry were found and explained by the simulation results. The calculation results also showed that the prediction of carbon monoxide emissions and the pressure history for early injections depend critically on key oxidation reaction rates in the chemical mechanism.

The operation in the nonlinear limit cycle has been tolerated on most applications to date. The need for quieter, smoother operation and reduced emissions has prompted new evaluations of the rotor bearing design for these systems. In this research a commercial rotordynamics computer program is used to evaluate the stability and transient response of a high speed automotive turbocharger. Various models with varying bearing designs and properties have been solved to obtain the linear stability threshold speeds and also the non-linear transient response. The predicted whirl speed map shows two modes of instability and is very similar to the limited test results in the literature.

(2006; Nature 439, 187-191) demonstrated CH4 emission from living and dead plant tissues under aerobic conditions. This work included some calculations to extrapolate the findings from the laboratory to the global scale and led various commentators to question the value of planting trees as a greenhouse mitigation option. The experimental work of Keppler et al. (2006) appears to be largely sound, although some concerns remain about the quantification of emission rates. However, whilst accepting their basic findings, we are critical of the method used for extrapolating results to a global scale. Using the same basic information, we present alternative calculations to estimate global aerobic plant CH4 emissions as 10-60 Mt CH4 year-1. This estimate is much smaller than the 62-236 Mt CH4 year-1 reported in the original study and can be more readily reconciled within the uncertainties in the established sources and sinks in the global CH4 budget. We also assessed their findings in terms of their possible relevance for planting trees as a greenhouse mitigation option. We conclude that consideration of aerobic CH4 emissions from plants would reduce the benefit of planting trees by between 0 and 4.4%. Hence, any offset from CH4 emission is small in comparison to the significant benefit from carbon sequestration. However, much critical information is still lacking about aerobic CH4 emission from plants. For example, we do not yet know the underlying mechanism for aerobic CH4 emission, how CH4 emissions change with light, temperature and the physiological state of leaves, whether emissions change over time under constant conditions, whether they are related to photosynthesis and how they relate to the chemical composition of biomass. Therefore, the present calculations must be seen as a preliminary attempt to assess the global significance from a basis of limited information and are likely to be revised as further information becomes available. © CSIRO 2006.","Climate change; Greenhouse gas; Methane; Plants; Source","Biomass; Climate change; Extrapolation; Greenhouse effect; Plants (botany); Tissue; Carbon sequestration; Dead plant tissues; Emission rates; Greenhouse mitigation; Methane; biogenic emission; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; greenhouse gas; laboratory method; methane; oxic conditions; photosynthesis; plant; Biomass; Climates; Greenhouse Effect; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744964099

The President's February 2002 Global Climate Change Initiative has the goal of significantly reducing the GHG intensity of the United States economy over the next 10 years, while sustaining the economic growth needed to finance investment in new, clean energy technologies. Carbon capture and sequestration technologies must play a key role if the U.S. is to slow the growth of GHG emissions, and ?as the emerging science justifies ?stop and then reverse that growth. DOE's Carbon Sequestration Program uses a two-prong approach to develop a portfolio of technologies and GHG mitigation strategies: (1) Make energy systems more efficient; and (2) Capture and sequester greenhouse gases. The first approach is being addressed by the core fossil energy programs and by FutureGen, a $1 billion dollar project to build the world's first integrated sequestration and hydrogen production research power plant. The second approach is being addressed by DOE's Carbon Sequestration R&D Program, which focuses primarily on developing capture and separation technologies that dramatically lower the costs of reducing CO2 emissions from gas and other streams by either pre- or post-combustion processes.

The President's February 2002 Global Climate Change Initiative has the goal of significantly reducing the GHG intensity of the United States economy over the next 10 years, while sustaining the economic growth needed to finance investment in new, clean energy technologies. Carbon capture and sequestration technologies must play a key role if the U.S. is to slow the growth of GHG emissions, and ?as the emerging science justifies ?stop and then reverse that growth. DOE's Carbon Sequestration Program uses a two-prong approach to develop a portfolio of technologies and GHG mitigation strategies: (1) Make energy systems more efficient; and (2) Capture and sequester greenhouse gases. The first approach is being addressed by the core fossil energy programs and by FutureGen, a $1 billion dollar project to build the world's first integrated sequestration and hydrogen production research power plant. The second approach is being addressed by DOE's Carbon Sequestration R&D Program, which focuses primarily on developing capture and separation technologies that dramatically lower the costs of reducing CO2 emissions from gas and other streams by either pre- or post-combustion processes. Based on the President's Global Climate Change Initiative, the Carbon Sequestration Program is aggressively accelerating the R&D to help meet the administration goals related to greenhouse gas reduction and climate change.

Although Art. 2 which states the major objective of the UNFCCC refers to a stabilisation of the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere it may sound as if only atmospheric aspects of the climate problem were addressed. Already the preamble, however, makes clear that the role of terrestrial and marine ecosystems as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases are important. The Kyoto-Protocol to the UNFCCC also recognises these interactions by including greenhouse gas emissions as well as sinks in the commitments that the industrialised countries should take in order to take a first step towards achieving the objective of Art. 2 UNFCCC. The Kyoto Protocol has not come into force since the United States have decided not to sign it and Russia is still discussing her signature which would render the Protocol into force. Nevertheless, with the Kyoto- Protocol coming into force or failing, a process has begun which establishes international and national institutions for the management of the carbon cycle. This process has surely not covered the whole of the carbon cycle, but atmospheric emissions are subject to controls in most countries. The research on atmospheric carbon flows has directed the attention towards the complete carbon cycle since there exist important interactions between the atmospheric, terrestrial, and marine carbon flows. The process of trying to understand these interactions is still under way. As a better knowledge about the complete carbon cycle emerges, the question arises as to whether this knowledge can and should be incorporated into the climate policy process and subsequently into the design of international institutions and conventions, which coordinate policy instruments for managing the carbon cycle. In the following a very brief description of the carbon cycle is introduced in order to identify the origins of human interference and to locate possible ways to manage the carbon cycle. This is followed by a short discussion of issues concerning an optimal management of the carbon cycle. From this ""nirvana approach"" practical steps are derived for the management of the carbon cycle under real world conditions, i.e. given institutional and political constraints but also constraints on the knowledge about the carbon cycle.

The core process of the concept examined is based on the high pressure steam gasification of high moisture low grade coals where CO2 is captured reacting exothermically with CaO-based sorbents and high hydrogencontent carbon-free fuel gas is produced without using additional shift reactors and CO2 separation stages. The carbonated sorbents are continuously fed to an oxygen blown calcination reactor where pure CO2 is released and active CaO is reproduced. This concept can be realised in a dual fluidised bed reactor system where coal gasification and CaCO3 calcination are taking place simultaneously. In this paper possible plant configurations are presented and detailed simulation of 400 MWe IGCC power plant based on a state of the art gas turbine cycle with a three pressure stage heat recovery steam generator is performed using the ASPEN Plus simulator. The calculated results demonstrate the capability of the power plant to deliver almost decarbonised electricity while achieving net plant efficiencies at about 38.4 % of coal lower heating value (LHV). Based on the energy analysis and the data generated from the simulation an exergy analysis was performed in order to quantify and localize the thermodynamic irreversibility in each process component as well as to asses the overall thermodynamic imperfection of the proposed process.

As a prerequisite, we quantified the retention of nutrients in the river from mass balances and deduced its seasonal variation. We detected that about 30% of the total nitrogen input is retained within the surveyed river section. In contrast, phosphorus release from sediments was shown to cause a considerable increase in present P concentrations. Average net phosphorus release rates of about 20 mg P m -2 d-1 in late summer were estimated for the Havel Lakes. Based on the observed patterns of N retention and P release we parametrized a newly developed water quality simulation program (TRAM), which allows alternative model approaches of different complexity to be implemented and tested. To account for the future trend of internal P loading, the phosphorus excess in lake sediments was estimated from core samples and included in the model as a state variable. For analyzing scenarios of reduced nutrient emissisions, the water quality simulation program was linked to mesoscale hydrological catchment models for the first time. From scenario simulations we conclude that internal P loading is likely to counteract efforts of emission control for decades. Even by significant reductions in external P loads, a persistent phosphorus limitation of primary production can hardly be established in the analyzed time frame of 13 years. Though in the short run a continued reduction in nitrogen loads appears to be the more promising approach of eutrophication management, we recommend enhanced efforts to diminish both N and P emissions.",,"emission; emission control; eutrophication; lacustrine deposit; lake; nitrogen; nutrient enrichment; phosphorus; river; water pollution; water quality; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Havel Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747031110

The problem for policy is how to promote economic growth while reducing environmental impacts. The response of society, so far, is inadequate to solve these problems. Dramatic reduction in emissions, are necessary. Most policy analysis does not consider dramatic changes. An important aspect of the limited time horizon of analysis and policy is that there are few plausible and specific visions of very-low-emission transport systems. Directed processes of change - transitions - to new forms of transport are required, in terms of transport systems, the structure of the built environment and lifestyles, and culture. It requires the consideration of how to initiate social and economic processes that will transform transportation. Policy must provide the direction and processes while realising that the ability to control outcomes in detail is limited. The literature on technology transitions is helpful here. The transportation-demand-management (TDM) literature shows how to change behaviour, in particular the need for packages of mutually supporting actions and policies.

Box 12 01 61, 27515 Bremerhaven, Germany","Atmospheric CO2 measured in Antarctic ice cores shows a natural variability of 80 to 100 ppmv during the last four glacial cycles and variations of approximately 60 ppmv in the two cycles between 410 and 650 kyr BP. We here use various paleo-climatic records from the EPICA Dome C Antarctic ice core and from oceanic sediment cores covering the last 740 kyr to force the ocean/atmosphere/biosphere box model of the global carbon cycle BICYCLE in a forward mode over this time in order to interpret the natural variability of CO2. Our approach is based on the previous interpretation of carbon cycle variations during Termination I (Köhler et al., 2005a). In the absense of a process-based sediment module one main simplification of BICYCLE is that carbonate compensation is approximated by the temporally delayed restoration of deep ocean [CO2-]. Our results match the low frequency changes in CO2 measured in the Vostok and the EPICA Dome C ice core for the last 650 kyr BP (r2≈0.75). During these transient simulations the carbon cycle reaches never a steady state due to the ongoing variability of the overall carbon budget caused by the time delayed response of the carbonate compensation to other processes. The average contributions of different processes to the rise in CO2 during Terminations I to V and during earlier terminations are: the rise in Southern Ocean vertical mixing: 36/22 ppmv, the rise in ocean temperature: 26/11 ppmv, iron limitation of the marine biota in the Southern Ocean: 20/14 ppmv, carbonate compensation: 15/7 ppmv, the rise in North Atlantic deep water formation: 13/0 ppmv, the rise in gas exchange due to a decreasing sea ice cover: - 8/ - 7 ppmv, sea level rise: - 12/ - 4 ppmv, and rising terrestrial carbon storage: - 13/ - 6 ppmv. According to our model the smaller interglacial CO2 values in the pre-Vostok period prior to Termination V are mainly caused by smaller interglacial Southern Ocean SST and an Atlantic THC which stayed before MIS 11 (before 420 kyr BP) in its weaker glacial circulation mode.",,"atmospheric chemistry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; gas exchange; ice core; ice cover; interglacial; paleoclimate; sediment core; simulation; Antarctica; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748524554

The materials possessed highly dispersed and polymerised VOx species as well as bulk-like V2O5. Propene was primarily formed via oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by lattice oxygen of VOx species. It was suggested that non-selective consecutive propene oxidation is initiated by the breaking of the C-C bond in the molecule by the lattice oxygen, forming formaldehyde as a side product, which is further oxidised to CO and CO2. The following order of initial steady state propene selectivity (at a zero degree of propane conversion) as a function of the nature of VO x species was established: a mixture of bulk-like V2O 5 and polymerised VOx &gt; polymerised VOx &gt; highly dispersed VOx species. The low propene selectivity over highly dispersed VOx species was explained by the fact that these species do not fully cover the bare acidic surface of γ-Al 2O3 where propene adsorption and further oxidation take place. Thus, two different locations of COx formation were considered: (i) in the vicinity of acidic sites of the support and (ii) on VOx species. The propene selectivity over samples possessing polymerised VOx species and bulk-like V2O5 strongly decreased with an increasing degree of propane conversion. Contrarily, highly dispersed VOx species showed the lowest ability for consecutive propene oxidation. © the Owner Societies 2006.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645364408

The generator will be fueled with coal mine methane that is currently being vented as part of the mine's ventilation system. Coal mine methane is one of several major sources of anthropogenic methane, accounting for about 10% of anthropogenic methane emissions in the United States. Methane is the second most important non-water greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential 21 times as great as that of carbon dioxide (CO2) on a mass basis. Thus, any coal mine methane that is emitted rather than utilized simultaneously represents a lost potential resource and the emission of a powerful greenhouse gas. The project objectives are to: 1) convert the low and variable concentrations of methane contained in coal mine methane gas that would otherwise be vented to the atmosphere to electricity; 2) provide the generated electric power to an existing electric power grid; 3) donate the value of the electricity generated during the project period to a local school district; and 4) determine the quantity of useful energy that can be economically produced when processing coal mine methane from a working coal mine and perform a techno-economic evaluation of the system. When operating at 95% capacity factor and a heat rate of 13,550 Btu/kWh HHV (higher heating value), the 70 kW generator will produce 583 MWh of electricity as it consumes 7,954,000 cubic feet of methane, with a global warming potential equivalent to 3,522 short tons of carbon dioxide, each year.

Both NOx and PM emissions standards were reduced to 2 g/kWh and 0.027 g/kWh, which were 40 and 85 percent lower than the 2003 new short-term emissions standards, respectively. These emissions standards are as stringent as the Euro5 standards that are scheduled for implementation in 2008. In addition, the transient-cycle test procedure for emissions compliance, labeled JE05, was introduced to replace the D13-mode steady-state test procedure. This paper describes exhaust emissions reduction technologies developed for Hino's 13-liter heavy-duty diesel engine so that it meets the above standards. A production catalyzed wall-flow DPF was employed to reduce PM emissions in both mass and small particles. NOx emissions were reduced by improving combustion with cooled EGR and without use of a NOx aftertreatment device. A NOx reduction catalyst was deemed premature for application in an engine operating under typical vehicle driving conditions in Japan because the exhaust gas temperature was low (e.g., 120 ∼ 200°C). An EGR valve and VG turbocharger, both with infinitely adjustable functions, were employed to significantly reduce both smoke and NOx emissions. Positions of both the EGR valve and the variable nozzles of the VG turbocharger were controlled by using the feedback information of intake charge air flow rate and intake charge pressure to maximize the EGR rate and reduce NOx emissions while keeping smoke low, especially under transient operating conditions.

Spatial modeling has been applied for the estimation of potential, application, and effects of such actions at different geographical scales. A GIS oriented model-MONERIS has been validated and applied to calculate possible nutrient reduction. The investigations show that WWTPs are the major source of phosphorus emission. The efficient reduction of P-emission is possible by combining two actions: full implementation of the National Programme of Municipal Wastewater Treatment with the application of nonphosphate detergents. The possible reduction of total phosphorus emission can be as high as 30-50% in 2015 for whole Vistula catchment (compared with the present state). The reduction of nitrogen emission is much more complex, as N-emission is arises mainly from diffuse sources-principally agriculture. The most important sources for emissions are via tile drainage and groundwater. In these cases the most promising actions are to increase the efficiency of fertilizer consumption and decrease the soil erosion.

The contribution of each mode to variations in emissions rates has been documented. The average brake-specific emissions of NOx and CO2 show a strong dependence on the driving modes and were the highest when the engine operated in the cruise mode. The amounts of time that the engine spends in the NTE region and also over continuous 30 s windows of NTE operation for the different routes were calculated. Results indicate that longer operation in the NTE region produced higher brake-specific emissions of NOx compared with their shorter operating counterparts.

Lowering the heat loss in general during the heating season and the use of local energy resources like solar radiation, it is nowadays possible to reduce the energy consumption of the entire building to passive-house standard. In this case the fossil energy reduction in the end is more than 80 % and the reduction of CO2-emissions proportional. In this approach the block of flats becomes more flexible to different situations of living, more space and comfort for the occupants is offered and the building is transformed with a new up-to-date design.

Large areas of forests in British Columbia (B.C.) are being infested by the Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB). Dead wood from MPB infestation of B.C.'s forest is expected to vastly exceed the ability of the pulp and lumber industry to utilize it; current estimates are that 200 to 600 million eu. m of wood will remain unharvested over the next 20 years. Regions where the damaged wood is not harvested will experience loss of jobs in the forestry sector, increased risk of forest fire hazard, carbon emissions from burned or decaying wood, and uncertainty about timing of replanting since this usually occurs at harvest. This paper report the results of a detailed preliminary techno-economic analysis of producing power from MPB killed wood. Power plant size and location are critical factors affecting overall power cost. Overall cost of power rises steeply at sizes below 300 MW net power output. By locating the power plant in an area of high Infestation, transportation distances can be minimized. A 300 MW power plant would consume 64 million eu. m of wood over a 20 year lifetime, and hence is a significant sink for otherwise unharvestable wood. Cost estimates are based on harvesting of whole dead trees with roadside chipping and transport to a central power plant located in either the Nazko or Quesnel regions of B.C. A circulating fluidized bed boiler with a conventional steam cycle is a currently available technology demonstrated In Finland. The estimated power cost is S68 to $74 per MWh, which is competitive with other ""green power"" values in B.C. Given recent values of export power in the Pacific Northwest, a 300 MW MPB power plant can compete with a carbon credit below $15 per tonne of CO2. © 2006 IEEE.","Biomass power; Direct combustion; Lodgepole pine; Mountain pine beetle; Power cost","Carbon; Fluidized beds; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Direct combustion; Lodgepole pine; Mountain pine beetle; Biomass",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549165158

The evaluation concluded that the containers (also known as resin liners) may fail during the 50 years interim storage period due to fabrication defects and the storage environment. Risks to container integrity were then assessed through field activities which included ultrasonic measurements of the container wall thinning and characterization studies of the waste resins. While results confirmed that containment had not been breached and no resin leakage from the containers was detected, localized wall thinning and pits especially on the inner surfaces of the resin liner, were evident. The carbon steel liners were replaced by stainless steel 316L liners, during 2003, to provide enhanced resistance to pitting corrosion. A plan to ""overpack"" the carbon steel liners in stainless steel overpacks has been developed.

This international collaboration has gathered information about wind turbine operation cold climates ever since. The starting point of the first Annex XIX period was to collect and identify the information available for those parties interested in deploying wind turbines to cold climate sites. Database of wind turbines operating in cold climate conditions was collected in order to gain access to needed information. In the course of the three year period, cold climate wind potential, measurement issues, project planning and economics and construction all the way to decommissioning of a cold climate wind turbine plant were considered. The results were published in two reports, State-of-the-art of wind energy in cold climates and Wind energy projects in cold climates, both available at the project web page at arcticwind.vtt.fi. The results of the first three year period revealed the need to better understand those challenges that are linked to cold climate sites in order to achieve the situation where the vast cold climate areas with promising wind potential could be harnessed economically. The second three year Annex XIX period, 2005-2007, will tackle the barriers that hamper the cost effective cold climate wind energy production. The topics of the ongoing period include such items as anti- and de-icing technology survey, market study for cold climate technology, icing as a source of production losses and icing in standards that relate to wind turbine development and usage. The aim is to reduce the risk that originate from cold climate and thereby reduce the cost of wind electricity produced in cold climates.",,"Atmospheric icing; International collaborations; International energy agency; Low operating temperature; Standard equipments; Turbine operation; Wind energy production; Wind energy projects; Exhibitions; International cooperation; Wind turbines; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876548817

It is located in the ecotone between the cultivated humid Pampa to the east and the arid Monte to the west. The region is characterized by a highly variable annual and seasonal distribution of rainfall (400-600 mm) concentrated in spring and fall. Average annual potential evapotranspiration is 800 mm. The average annual temperature is 15-16°C. Soils are mainly Calciustolls with a petrocalcic horizon at a depth varying from 0.5 to 2 m. Cattle raising, based on cow-calf operations, is the most important economic activity in the Caldenal where stocker calves are raised to be fattened later in the more humid Pampa. The ranchers in Caldenal practice continuous grazing with very high grazing pressure, that has resulted in a severe overgrazing. Stocking rates are approximately 7 ha cow-1 yr-1. Currently the area supports an increasing pressure over its grass herbaceous resources. On the other hand, the humid Pampa is increasingly devoted to cash crop cultivation, mainly soybean. This causes a displacement of cattle breeding and fattening enterprises to more marginal areas. As a result, some feed-lot businesses are being located in the Caldenal region nowadays. The Caldenal region appears suitable for a more intensive agricultural use. In an attempt to find a cropping strategy that reduces the constraints of climate and soil a non-tillage, legume ley farming system based on improved high-yielding pasture legumes is proposed in the Caldenal.","Caldenal; Ley farming; Livestock production; Medics; Rangeland","cultivation; economic activity; ecotone; grazing pressure; legume; rainfall; seasonal variation; soybean; sustainable development; technology; temperate environment; Argentina; Caldenal; Pampas; South America; Bos; Glycine max; Medicago",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148951312

Increasing the wind power capacity is in this relation considered to be an important component of the Danish CO2 reduction strategy. The density of wind turbines on-land is relatively high in Denmark. The future wind power development is expected to be carried through by replacing existing land-based wind turbines with fewer but larger turbines and setting up large off-shore wind farms. However, increasing the wind power capacity is not without problems, as wind turbines have negative impacts on the surrounding landscape. The changes in the landscape associated with future wind power development, makes it highly relevant from a policy point of view to elicit the attitudes towards wind power development in Denmark. The present paper analyses the attitudes towards existing and future land-based turbines and off-shore wind farms. The analysis is carried out using a probit model to elicit systematic characteristics of the population, which have a significant influence on the attitude towards wind power. Overall the results show that offshore wind farms are preferred to on-land turbines. On a more detailed level younger respondents are more positive towards wind power compared to older respondents. The results also denote those respondents negatively affected by off-shore wind farms also are more negative.

Apart from CH4 and CO measurements, the air flow velocity in the area was also analysed. Only for several per cent of cases, an increase of CH4 emissions was registered after the occurrence of seismic phenomena. These phenomena had no impact on CO emissions and air flow velocity. A big group of unexplained phenomena was observed (30 per cent of cases), where the occurrence of tremors was preceded by distinct drops of air velocity in the area.",,"airflow; carbon monoxide; flow velocity; methane; mining-induced seismicity; rockburst",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247580863

In order to reduce pollutant concentrations in the atmosphere, an action has already been engaged at the European scale with ratification of the Göteborg protocol and its relay at national and regional scales. Nevertheless the efficiency of such policies has not been subject to a precise analysis yet, in particular for secondary compounds for which formation processes are not linear. The study presented here aims to estimate by 3 dimensional modelling the efficiency of legislations for the year 2010 through simulations of a set of realistic scenarios. Results have shown that an improvement of air quality is expected thanks to the use of new technologies and adherence to these legislations. We demonstrate here that a combined action at a both continental and regional scale is complementary and necessary to efficiently reduce ozone maximal and background values on a regional domain. Nevertheless for the most extreme events, the addition of punctual and local emergency measures appears to be necessary.","Emergency measures; Emission reduction scenarios; Legislations; Statistical study","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); conference proceeding; environmental policy; human activity; legislation; ozone; pollution control; three-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148942834

Important parameters such as the leaf area index are fully determined by the global vegetation model and the influences of light extinction (for isoprene emissions) and leaf age (for isoprene and methanol emissions) are also taken into account. We study the interannual variability of biogenic emissions using the satellite-based climate forcing ISLSCP-II as well as relevant CO2 atmospheric levels, for the 1983-1995 period. Mean global emissions of 460 TgC/yr for isoprene, 117 TgC/yr for monoterpenes, 106 TgC/yr for methanol and 42 TgC/yr for acetone are predicted. The mean global emission of all biogenic compounds is 752±16 TgC/yr with extremes ranging from 717 TgC/yr in 1986 to 778 TgC/yr in 1995, that is a 8.5% increase between both. This variability differs significantly from one region to another and among the regions studied, biogenic emissions anomalies were the most variable in Europe and the least variable in Indonesia (isoprene and monoterpenes) and North America (methanol). Two scenarios of land use changes are considered using the 1983 climate and atmospheric CO2 conditions, to study the sensitivity of biogenic emissions to vegetation alteration, namely tropical deforestation and European afforestation. Global biogenic emissions are highly affected by tropical deforestation, with a 29% decrease in isoprene emission and a 22% increase in methanol emission. Global emissions are not significantly affected by European afforestation, but on a European scale, total biogenic VOCs emissions increase by 54%.",,"biogenic emission; climate variation; deforestation; land use change; leaf area index; light effect; volatile organic compound; Asia; Eurasia; Europe; Indonesia; North America; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745551745

With this approach, it is possible to identify some proper locations for generation plants as a consequence of a suitable analysis of urban critical aspects.

Previous studies involving human and animal subjects seem to indicate that NO involvement is limited to the CO2-dependent mechanism (chemoregulation) and not to the pressure-dependent autoregulation (mechanoregulation). We tested this hypothesis in patients with impaired endothelial function compared with healthy controls. Blood pressure, heart rate, end-tidal PCO2, CBF velocities (CBFV), forearm blood flow, and reactive hyperemia were assessed in 16 patients with diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension and compared with 12 age-and sex-matched healthy controls. Pressure-dependent autoregulation was determined by escalating doses of phenylephrine. CO2 vasoreactivity index was extrapolated from individual slopes of mean CBFV during normocapnia, hyperventilation, and CO 2 inhalation. Measurements were repeated after sodium nitroprusside infusion. Indexes of endothelial function, maximal and area under the curve (AUC) of forearm blood flow (FBF) changes, were significantly impaired in patients (maximal flow: 488 ± 75 vs. 297 ± 31%; P = 0.01, AUC ΔFBF: 173 ± 17 vs. 127 ± 11; P = 0.03). Patients and controls showed similar changes in cerebrovascular resistance during blood pressure challenges (identical slopes). CO2 vasoreactivity was impaired in patients compared with controls: 1.19 ± 0.1 vs. 1.54 ± 0.1 cm·s-1·mmHg-1; P = 0.04. NO donor (sodium nitroprusside) offsets this disparity. These results suggest that patients with endothelial dysfunction have impaired CO2 vasoreactivity and preserved pressure-dependent autoregulation. This supports our hypothesis that NO is involved in CO2-dependent CBF regulation alone. CBFV chemoregulation could therefore be a surrogate of local cerebral endothelial function.

This includes the effects of changing atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate, disturbances, and increasing nitrogen deposition from air pollution (Ehleringer and Field 1993, Vitousek et al. 1997). Quantification and uncertainty analysis of carbon pools and fluxes by terrestrial biota is needed to guide policy and management decisions. Unanswered questions include: (1) how and where is the terrestrial biosphere currently sequestering carbon? (2) how might forests be managed to maximize carbon sequestration? Managed carbon sequestration would have to be optimized within and among geographic regions with attention to how this might affect biodiversity and how to manage for the effects of ?natural? disturbances on carbon storage and fluxes. Processes in the terrestrial biosphere are dynamic and occur over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. For example, net ecosystem production is the net effect of several large fluxes: photosynthetic uptake, and release of carbon dioxide (CO2) by respiration from autotrophs (plants) and heterotrophs (e.g., microbial decomposition). Scales range from micrometers and microseconds (e.g., cellular processes such as photosynthesis) to kilometers and centuries (e.g., decomposition of recalcitrant pools of soil carbon) (Figure 9.1). Disturbance can have a significant effect on CO2 loss to the atmosphere through decomposition of necromass such as that left from logging of forests, or pulses of CO2 to the atmosphere from fire, and through manufacturing of forest products. Interannual variation in climate can influence photosynthesis and respiration differently such that net CO2 uptake can change significantly. These factors complicate any simple scheme to quantify carbon storage and fluxes from ecosystems, yet it is important to know how disturbance and climate interact to affect biogeochemical processes for more informed management at the regional scale. Scaling strategies in terrestrial processes often involve upscaling process data at a scale smaller than the scale of interest (e.g., leaf-level photosynthesis), and combining this information with structural and environmental data to quantify process rates at the scale of interest (Aber et al. 1993, Jarvis 1995, Wu and Li, Chapters 1 and 2). Such strategies take into account the feedbacks among components (e.g., atmosphere and vegetation), and linkages across scales (e.g., leaf-standlandscape), and require that models are used and tested at each scale.In this chapter, we demonstrate an approach to using field observations, remote sensing tools, and a biogeochemistry model (Biome-BGC) in a spatially nested hierarchy (Wu 1999) to improve predictions of carbon pools, productivity, and net ecosystem production (NEP) for every square kilometer of forests in a region. We examine uncertainty in a variety of ways for the different levels of data analysis. © 2006 Springer.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900107227

The inversion has been attributed to the quantum interference in the recombination process from the two oxygen centers. Using the Lewenstein model to calculate HHG from fixed C O2 molecules and taking into account the partial alignment of the molecules versus the time delay, we interpret that the inversion is due to the degree of overlap between the partially aligned molecules and the angular dependence of the HHG yield. We also note that the harmonic order where inversion occurs may change with probe laser intensity due to the depletion of the ground state. © 2006 The American Physical Society.",,"Depletion; High-order harmonic generation; Inversion; Inverted modulation; Lewenstein model; Pump-probe delay; Harmonic generation; Ionization; Modulation; Molecules; Oxygen; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645664177

Compactness in fact means that less floor space is required and makes it possible to install the switchgear as close as possible to energy users in urban centres, thus minimising losses. It also leads to a reduction in the cost of materials used for construction, building and civil works. Reliability ensures that there are no operating stoppages and no additional costs due to non-distribution of energy. Overall, optimised compactness and reliability reduce costs and environmental impacts over the life time of a product. The strategies and methods used to achieve compactness and reliability in the design and development of new gas insulated switchgear (GIS) with a rated voltage of 420 kV are described. They firstly involve the digital simulation methods that are now used to model the hydrodynamic behaviour of the electric arc in the event of fault current breaking. They also involve the use of advanced optical technologies in the design of measuring transformers. It is shown that the constant reduction in the energy required to operate high-voltage circuit breakers has also made it possible to use a low-energy mechanical drive for the new 420 kV circuit breaker. The new bay controllers have additional functions that will prevent incidents and allow various maintenance strategies to be implemented. The results of the life cycle assessment summarise, from the environmental point of view, all the implications related to the compactness and reliability of this new switchgear assembly.

It is shown that the lasers, grown with large number of QD stacks are metamorphic, with plastic relaxation occurring through the formation of misfit dislocations. Thus, 1.3 μm QD lasers with large number of stacks grown without strain compensation are metamorphic. Another type of defects is related to local dislocated clusters, which are the most dangerous. When proper optimization of the growth conditions is carried out, including a selective thermal etching off of statistically formed dislocated clusters through the defect-reduction technique (DRT), no significant impact of misfit dislocations on the degradation robustness is observed. In uncoated devices a high cw single mode power of ∼700 mW is realized limited by thermal roll-over, which is not affected by 500 h ageing at room temperature. At elevated temperatures the main degradation mechanism revealed is catastrophic optical mirror damage (COMD). When the facet are passivated, the devices show the extrapolated operation lifetime in excess of 106 h at 40°C at ∼100 mW cw single mode output power. Longer wavelength (1.4-1.5 μm) devices are grown on metamorphic (In,Ga,Al)As layers deposited on GaAs substrates. In this case, the plastic relaxation occurs through formation of both misfit and threading dislocations. The latter kill the device performance. Using DRT in this case enables blocking of threading dislocation with growth of QDs in defect-free upper layers. DRT is realized by selective capping of the defect-free areas and high-temperature etching of nano-holes at the non-capped regions near the dislocation. The procedure results in etching of holes and is followed by fast lateral overgrowth with merger of the growth fronts. If the defect does not propagate into the upper layer when the hole is capped, the upper layers become defect-free. Lasers based on this approach exhibited emission wavelength in the 1.4-1.5 μm range with a differential quantum efficiency of about ∼50%. The narrow-stripe lasers operate in a single transverse mode and withstand continuous current density above 20 kA cm-2 without degradation. A maximum continuous-wave output power of 220 mW limited by thermal roll-over is obtained. No beam filamentation was observed up to the highest pumping levels. Narrow stripe devices with as-cleaved facets are tested for 60°C (800 h) and 70°C (200 h) on-chip temperature. No noticeable degradation has been observed at 50 mW cw single mode output power. This shows the possibility of degradation-robust devices on foreign substrates. The technology opens a way for integration of various III-V materials and may target degradation-free lasers on silicon for further convergence of computing and communications.","Diode lasers; Epitaxial growth; Quantum dots","Continuous wave lasers; Degradation; Epitaxial growth; Light; Optical properties; Relaxation processes; Semiconductor quantum dots; Catastrophic optical mirror damage (COMD); Defect-free layers; Degradation resistance; Threading dislocations; Semiconductor lasers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646732635

Different charge motions were produced by three differently shaped plates in the CMCV device, each of which blocked off 75% of the engine's intake ports. Time-resolved HC, CO and CO2 concentrations were measured at the exhaust port exit in order to achieve cycle-by-cycle engine-out HC mass and in-cylinder air/fuel ratio. Combustion characteristics were examined through a thermodynamic burn rate analysis. Cold-fluid steady state experiments were carried out with the CMCV open and closed. Enhanced charge motion with the CMCV closed was found to shorten the combustion duration, which caused the location of 50% mass fraction burned (MFB) to occur up to 5° CA earlier for the same spark timing. By the use of the CMCV, significant improvements in combustion stability and fuel efficiency were also achieved with increased levels of spark retard mainly due to enhanced fuel-air mixing and relatively faster burning. Engine start-up experiments were conducted with three different geometric CMCVs using various fuel injection and spark timing strategies. The CMCV improved mixture preparation due to increased swirl and tumble intensities, which enhanced fuel transport, distribution, and evaporation. Flow bench and engine test results indicate that more fuel was evaporated with the CMCV geometry that produced moderate swirl and tumble intensities rather than high swirl or tumble alone. The effects of enhanced charge motion on combustion characteristics were decoupled from those on mixture preparation and were found to increase combustion stability and burning rate. Those combined effects of greater fuel evaporation and faster burning rate with the CMCV closed allowed strategies with reduced fuel injection and additional spark retard during cold start, resulting in a significant reduction in HC emissions. For the same in-cylinder air/fuel ratio profile, engine-out HC emissions following cold start-up were reduced by 18% during 0-3 seconds and by 7% during 3-20 seconds with the CMCV closed using reduced fuel injection and retarded spark timing strategy.

The hypothesis is that if an individual's selfish incentive can be made to align more with the socially optimal objective, then the creative energy of individuals' diversity would become more unified in achieving the social objective. The key is to make that incentive market-based and monetary in nature This paper will first outline the concept of UDI-ism and discuss how it will benefit the economy in general It will then apply this concept to the problem of global warming and show how it will enable market principles to manage the effect of CO2 emitted by the electricity sector. Instead of using a CO2 tax to penalize power production sources which emit CO2, this approach considers air as the common asset of all human inhabitants of the Earth. The price of CO2 is a means for the collection of money paid by electricity consumers into a trust fund That trust fund is owned jointly by residents of a country or a region. That money is managed and used for environment benefits according to the wish of the residents This method is more effective than tax credits or other tax incentives to promote green technologies, because it is a market method Preliminary analysis in this paper shows that this method can significantly reduce the global CO2 emissions without increasing the cost of electricity by an unreasonable amount. With the effect of CO2 on global warming becoming more urgent, this method may offer the best solution for the most effective way to solve the problem With the power system as an example application, it is hoped that this paper will stimulate discussions among researchers to further explore these ideas so that a more robust and more optimal economic system will become reality. © 2006 IEEE.","Greenhouse gas mitigation; Power market restructuring; Power system economics; Power system planning","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Emission control; Environmental protection; Global warming; Social aspects; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Power market restructuring; Power system economics; Power system planning; Electric power generation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43549126674

Methane emissions attributable to other wetlands add another 1.6-3.8 Gt CO 2 equivalents. From a global standpoint, N 2O from unmanaged soils and CH 4 from peatlands and other wetlands make soils naturally net greenhouse gas emitters. In addition, the storage of carbon in soils and the fluxes of CH 4 and N 2O have been changed by anthropogenic effects towards emission rates 52 to 72% above those under natural conditions before the dawn of intensive agriculture and land-use change. Land-use changes on mineral soils induced most of the recorded losses of soil organic matter (SOM), but there is evidence that proper agricultural management of soil resources is able to recover some of these losses and to maintain soil functions. However, the discrepancy between so-called 'sequestration potentials' and the measures already adopted is amazingly large. Globally, only about 5% of the cropped areas is managed according to practices such as no tillage or organic farming. The contribution of soil loss by erosion, desertification and sealing to global oxidative SOM losses is uncertain; however, in the case of soil erosion, it is considered to be a major factor in global SOM decline. Mitigation options calculated for SOM restoration, reduced CH 4 and N 2O emissions are able to alleviate mean annual emissions by 1.2 to 2.9 Gt CO 2 equivalents, mainly as a result of carbon sequestration, which is the most efficient measure for the next few decades. In the longer term, however, the large potential for reducing CH 4 and N 2O emissions outweigh the finite capacity of soils to recover C. Integrated assessment of net greenhouse-gas fluxes is key for evaluating management practices aimed at reducing overall emissions. From the viewpoint of climate change and taking into consideration the mean fluxes of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O, peatland protection is more favourable than peatland cultivation in the long term. The most important gaps in our understanding appear to be with regard to estimating fluxes along with soil erosion and desertification processes, in the extent of peatland cultivation; the role of black carbon formation, natural 'background' sequestration rates of undisturbed soils; and the net response of soils, particularly in cold regions, to global warming. With regard to the societal perception of soil contributing to the global cycling of greenhouse gases, it is important to emphasize that significant proportions of the emissions are inevitably linked to intensive agriculture. © The Geological Society of London 2006.",,"agricultural change; anthropogenic effect; carbon sequestration; climate change; global warming; greenhouse gas; land use change; methane; soil conservation; soil emission; soil erosion; soil management; soil organic matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847380102

We find that the nitrogen is not enhanced in NGC6822 (nor in M33) as much as was expected from their respective metallicities. In contrast, the helium is largely enhanced in all the galaxies.

All of the methods evaluated may have a role to play and could be useful in specific circumstances. The main consideration should be the ability to obtain representative emission estimates that can be used in assessing emission fees; evaluating community impacts; and determining permitting requirements for facility modifications and/or new construction. Maintaining Method 21 as a tool for determining emissions will result in inconsistencies between the monitoring methods. Therefore, it is not recommended.

Exhaust gas and skin temperatures were also measured along the exhaust pipe of the instrumented vehicle, so the thermal characteristics and the efficiency of the catalyst monitored could be included in the analysis. Different turning movements (driving patterns) at the priority T-junction were investigated such as straight, left and right turns with and without stops. The test car was hot stable running conditions before each test, thereby negating cold start effects. To demonstrate the influence of the junction on tail-pipe emissions and fuel consumption, distance based factors were determined that compared the intersection drive-through measurements with steady speed (state) runs. Fuel consumption was increased at intersections by a factor of 1.3∼5.9. CO, THC and NOx emission were increased by a factor of 8∼26, 6∼21 and 2.5∼10 respectively. Benzene emissions were also increased by a factor of 4∼21. Through fine-scale analysis of real-world driving profiles and tail-pipe emissions, this research makes a contribution to our understanding of the variability in driving parameters and emission production in urban areas.

CO2 storage must be carefully planned and monitored to ensure that the CO2 is safely retained in the formation for periods of at least thousands of years. Seismic methods, particularly for offshore reservoirs, are the primary tool for monitoring the injection process and distribution of CO2 in the reservoir over time provided that reservoir properties are favourable. Seismic methods are equally essential for the characterisation of a potential trap, determining the reservoir properties, and estimating its capacity. Hence, an assessment of the change in seismic response to CO2 storage needs to be carried out at a very early stage. This must be revisited at later stages, to assess potential changes in seismic response arising from changes in fluid properties or mineral composition that may arise from chemical interactions between the host rock and the CO2. Thus, carefully structured modelling of the seismic response changes caused by injection of CO2 into a reservoir over time helps in the design of a long-term monitoring program. For that purpose we have developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) driven rock physics simulator, designed to model both short and long-term 4D seismic responses to injected CO2. The application incorporates CO2 phase changes, local pressure and temperature changes, chemical reactions and mineral precipitation. By incorporating anisotropic Gassmann equations into the simulator, the seismic response of faults and fractures reactivated by CO2 can also be predicted. We show field examples (potential CO2 sequestration sites offshore and onshore) where we have tested our rock physics simulator. 4D seismic responses are modelled to help design the monitoring program. © 2006, CSIRO.

The core of this strategy is the establishment of a climate insurance programme specialized in supporting developing country insurance-related initiatives for sudden- and slow-onset weatherrelated disasters. This programme could take many institutional forms, including an independent facility, a facility in partnership with other institutions of the donor community, or as part of a multi-purpose disaster management facility operated outside of the climate regime. Its main purpose would be to enable the establishment of public—private safety nets for climate-related shocks by assisting the development of (sometimes novel) insurance-related instruments that are affordable to the poor and coupled with actions and incentives for pro-active preventive measures. A second tier could provide disaster relief contingent on countries making credible efforts to manage their risks. Since it would be based on precedents of donor-supported insurance systems in developing countries, a main advantage of this proposed climate insurance strategy is its demonstrated feasibility. Other advantages include its potential for linking with related donor initiatives, providing incentives for loss reduction and targeting the most vulnerable.

The variations in some of the key combustion and operational parameters were determined experimentally. These included cylinder pressure and its rise rate temporal developments, autoignition timing, combustion durations for both the low and high temperature reaction regions, COV values for IMEP and maximum cylinder pressure, and the incidence of knock and its intensity. In parallel with the experimental investigation, results of a numerical simulation of the processes involved obtained by employing a KIVA based approach while incorporating sufficiently detailed chemical kinetics are presented. It was found that supplementing n-heptane HCCI with gaseous fuels could inhibit the low temperature combustion region and delay to varying extents the high temperature combustion region. Methane admission produced lengthening of the delay to autoignition and extended the combustion durations. It is suggested that supplementing the liquid fuel with methane may be a means for controlling the combustion process of a liquid fuelled HCCI engine while obtaining higher power and acceptable levels of emissions without producing unacceptably heavy knock.

Carbon is also involved in many physicochemical processes on all time scales. Biological processes have caused the accumulation of ancient organic carbon deposits in the form of oil, coal, peat, methane gas or gas hydrates over the millennia as well as massive deposits of inorganic carbon (e.g. limestones). The recent reactivation of these fossil fuel deposits for energy production by man over the very short time span of less than a century has led to the present sharp rise in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the atmosphere as shown in Figure 3.2.1.1. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is one component, amongst several, influencing the heat balance of Earth over long time scales. Changes in its concentration are generally associated with changes in Earth's climate. Therefore, much attention in recent years has been focussed on understanding variations in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. It has to be borne in mind, however, that other ""greenhouse"" gases are concomitantly released into the atmosphere enhancing the effect of CO2 (Prather et al. 2001). The most important ones are water vapour, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and tropospheric ozone (O3). They either originate directly from human activities, such as burning of plant biomass or release of methane from rice paddies and cattle, or their production is caused by changing environmental conditions, such as changes in the water cycle or emission of methane and dinitrogenoxide from suboxic areas on land and in the sea. The effect of these gases on the heat balance of Earth is amplified by changes in water vapour content in the atmosphere. Furthermore, aerosols may add or diminish the effects of ""greenhouse"" gases (Penner et al. 2001). Depending on the type of aerosol and its distribution, it can either reflect solar radiation back into space providing a cooling effect or it can absorb solar radiation and thus heat up certain strata of the atmosphere. Backscattering of solar radiation by clouds (cloud albedo) is a major feedback in the atmosphere to regulate the surface temperature of the Earth. At present, the heating effect of the ""greenhouse"" gases is thought to be compensated by the backscattering of solar radiation by clouds and aerosol particles. Recent estimates indicate that the heating impact of ""greenhouse"" gases may be reduced by 65%-80% due to albedo effects (Crutzen and Ramanathan, Dahlem Conference May 2003, in press). These authors argue that it is not likely that aerosols will increase at the same rate as CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and, hence, the heating effect may rise more rapidly in future. High CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, however, have also quite different effects on the environment. They increase photosynthesis in land plants, reduce the pH of water and can alter calcification processes. Experiments have shown that carbonate formation by marine organisms, including plankton, algae and corals, is inhibited at concentrations of ca. 800 ppm expected for the year 2100 (Kleypas et al. 1999, Riebesell et al. 2000). In fact, models predict a drastic reduction in carbonate formation (Figure 3.2.1.2) with unknown consequences for the marine ecosystem. It would endanger coral reefs, decrease their high biodiversity and may deteriorate the stabilisation by the reefs for coasts and tropical islands. It would also change the composition of plankton organisms in the open ocean with possible impacts on the production of fish. In addition to the above mentioned direct influences of rising CO2, indirect effects are suspected from climatic changes triggered by the increasing atmospheric concentrations. At present, rising global temperatures are being observed that are the result of the combined effects of ""greenhouse"" gases, water vapour, aerosols and clouds. These components are linked by various feedback processes, which enhance or compensate each other. Therefore, the understanding and modelling of such complex interacting systems is a major challenge for future research which requires to consider the linkages within the Earth system. Global average temperature increase predicted by different models range from 1.7 to 4.2°C with a mean of 2.8°C over the next 100 years. Sea level rises due to thermal expansion of sea water and melting of glaciers are predicted to amount to 0.48m (range 0.09-0.88m) over the same time span as a result of global warming. Such climatic changes will alter hydrological cycles, ocean stratification and current systems. The present knowledge of carbon flows and their effects on our climate is compiled most comprehensively in the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports (IPPC 2001). After a decade of basic research into the pivotal role of the element carbon in the Earth system, the international scientific community has now launched into a new effort to link the present understanding of the natural carbon cycle with the behaviour of human societies. This ""Global Carbon Project"" (GCP, see http://www. globalcarbonproject.org/) has defined the following central issues for the next decade of research: 1. Patterns and variability: What are the current geographical and temporal distributions of the major stores and fluxes in the global carbon cycle? 2. Processes and interactions: What are the control and feedback mechanisms . both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic . that determine the dynamics of the carbon cycle? 3. Management of the carbon cycle: What are the likely dynamics of the carbonclimate system into the future and what points of intervention and windows of opportunity exist for human societies to manage this system? The GCP is a joint project of the four global change programmes IGBP, WCRP, IHDP and DIVERSITAS. Its main function is to address the above questions by integration of knowledge and data obtained by other research programmes. It has the task to link natural and human sciences with the aim to better understand the carbon cycle and to assess mitigation and adaptation options for society. This article will firstly give a brief overview over the present understanding of the variability and of critical processes in respect to atmospheric carbon concentrations. In the following some of the research issues will be highlighted that were identified in several workshops as being of particular relevance to link natural and socio-economic sciences in respect to carbon research. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895303327

Since the nature of emergencies precludes precise planning, emergency planning is general and, hopefully, attempts to address all possible scenarios. The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness of potential massive disruptions in energy resources that abrupt climate change might cause. The enormity of emergency response requirements to these disruptions and the potentially severe consequences of such an event compel that we begin emergency preparedness planning now. There are indications that global warming may be occurring due to both climatic variabilities and anthropomorphic activities; although the exact certainty of the magnitudes of each forcing function is far from established The trigger for the warming is cause for extensive debate, and the unevenness leads to challenges of the phenomena. But the fact that a warming cycle is in progress over the past 30 years seems apparent. To date the changes have been gradual, but scientists are now recognizing that possibly near-term changes in the ocean's thermohaline conveyor could cause more severe winters, droughts, and stronger winds at many locations. Disruption of food production in the breadbasket regions of the world will create severe political and social upheaval. Potable water shortages will lead to destabilizing concentrations of humanity around water sources. Restricted transportation capabilities, due to reduced access to petroleum products resulting from inhospitable and prohibitive environmental degradation, will further exacerbate the problems. Energy is critical to sustenance - even the survivability - of society. Energy provides power for industry, for lighting and heating, for water pumping/desalinization, for sewage treatment, for communications - those basic functions necessary to maintain an orderly and productive society. The 2003 U.S. Department of Defense Report An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States National Security provides a plausible set of scenarios of disruption in food, water and energy resources that could de-stabilize governments and society. This paper first evaluates the abrupt global warming scenarios as they describe disruption of energy resources. It then suggests an energy policy that can mitigate the abrupt global climate change challenges, and suggests activities that can support energy sustainability for the United States. Centers for energy generation and the necessary transmission systems for national baseline energy sustainability can be defined with engineering logic. The challenge is to gain societal acceptance and governmental concurrence to develop and implement them. The expected societal and political obstacles, based on current attitudes and experiences of the current nuclear power industry, are well recorded, and provide relatively accurate projections of future social and political challenges (e.g., regulation, restriction, the ""not in my backyard"" attitude NIMBY-ism, general fear of all things nuclear). By recognizing these challenges, sustainable energy generation resources can be designed, made acceptable to the public, sited, constructed, and protected against the environmental challenges of abrupt global climate change. Preparedness, through planning, for a sustainable and diverse energy infrastructure to meet the challenges of abrupt climate change should begin now.",,"Emergency planning; Emergency response; Preparedness; Thermohaline conveyors; Accident prevention; Climate change; Energy resources; Food products; Potable water; Weathering; Strategic planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846070187

In light of the inhibition effects of 4-cp on phenol degradation and the substrate inhibition of phenol at high concentrations in the cometabolic transformation of 4-cp, an integrated bioreactor system incorporating adsorption on granular activated carbon and hollow fiber membrane cell immobilization was fabricated and studied. Polysulfone hollow fiber membranes were used to immobilize the cells within the sponge-like porous regions, while activated carbon was provided to reduce the solution concentrations of the two substrates. Under batch operation of the bioreactor, simultaneous transformation of 1600 mg/L phenol and 200 mg/L 4-cp could be achieved. By immobilizing the cells in the hollow fiber membranes, the cells could tolerate much higher concentrations of both phenol and 4-cp.

We measured pools of soil mineral (ammonium and nitrate) and organic (amino acid and microbial biomass) nitrogen, in situ rates of net mineralization, net nitrification, net amino acid production, and decomposition, as well as soil carbon turnover in a laboratory incubation experiment. Soils at treeline were mostly colder than forested soils, particularly during fall and over winter, and had reduced rates of nitrogen cycling and litter decomposition relative to forested stands. Treeline soils also had lower rates of potential respiration per unit carbon, suggesting reduced soil organic matter quality relative to forest soils. Therefore, effects of both colder temperatures and poorer substrate quality appeared to suppress rates of nitrogen turnover at treeline. Seasonal patterns of nitrogen turnover were similar across latitudes (i.e., mountain ranges). On average, 70% of total annual net nitrogen mineralization occurred from August through May, suggesting that fall and winter are critical periods for soil nitrogen transformations in both forested and treeline ecosystems. Among mountain ranges, pool sizes and fluxes of nitrogen were similar despite significant variation in growing season length and mean annual temperatures. Soil moisiure and soil organic matter quality may have stronger effects on variation in nitrogen cycling than temperature at our sites.","Amino acids; Mineralization; Nitrogen cycling; Seasonal patterns; Treeline; Winter","amino acid; mineralization; nitrification; nitrogen cycle; soil moisture; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter; treeline; Alaska; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846305697

The results of these simulation exercises have been correlated against continuously recorded climatic survey data collected from longwall coal districts at two representative deep UK coal mines. The survey data used was continuously measured to record the climate across the longwall districts during both weekday production periods and weekend non-production periods. An analysis of the measured data was able to establish average dry and wet bulb temperatures, which characterised the climate within the workings during weekday production and weekend non-production periods. To determine the major contribution that the geothermal properties of the surrounding rock mass have on the heat transfer to the ventilating air stream, a series of climatic simulation and correlation exercises were conducted to establish a base line data set for these parameters during non-production periods. A second series of parametric and correlation exercises were conducted on the longwall climatic simulation model to identify the range of values to be taken by the parameters governing the contribution of heat transfer from the installed electrical machinery and cut mineral during the weekday production periods. It is concluded that these exercises were able to identify a base set of values for the model input parameters that enabled the longwall climatic models to satisfactorily replicate the climatic conditions experienced across two representative UK deep mine longwall districts during production and non-production periods. © 2006 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.","Climatic modelling; Longwall coal mining; Mine climate","Climate change; Coal mines; Computer simulation; Correlation methods; Heat transfer; Mathematical models; Parameter estimation; Planning; Climatic modeling; Climatic simulation; Longwall coal mining; Mine climate; Longwall mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845716902

However, firing biomass presents a number of technical problems, that substantially limit its use in existing coal-fired plants and the formation of deposits in the system is one of the key issues. This paper presents a computational fluid dynamics model that predicts biomass particle depositions in an industrial pf combustion test furnace where the release of potassium in the biomass has been modeled and the residual ash composition determines the stickiness of the particle. The direct impact of the particles on the deposition surface has been considered as the dominant pathway of the particle deposition in the furnace and the overall deposition rate is determined by the chemical and kinetic states of the particles when they come in contact with the deposition surface. When the combustion products leave the furnace then undergo cooling in the boiler section. The processes that take place are discussed, and the information is given on the deposition of the potassium species. A number of simulations have been performed and the model predictions have been compared with the limited available experimental data. The effects of the various model constants on the formation of the deposition have been discussed.

Many of these models adopt the Farquhar et al. approach, in which leaf carbon assimilation of C3 plants is regulated by two limitations depending on the rate of Rubisco activity and ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate regeneration (RuBP). This approach was expanded upon by others to include a third limitation that expresses the occurrence, in some plant species, of a photosynthetic downregulation under high concentrations of ambient CO2. Several ecosystem models, however, constrain leaf photosynthesis using only two limitations according to the original formulation of Farquhar et al. and thus neglect the limitation that represents the downregulation of photosynthesis under elevated atmospheric CO2. In this study, the authors first reviewed the effect of elevated CO2 on photosynthesis of C 3 plants, which illustrated that short-term observations are likely to considerably underestimate the number of plant species that exhibit a photosynthetic downregulation. Several recent long-term field observations have shown that such downregulation starts to be effective only after several seasons/years of plant exposure to elevated CO2. Second, an ecosystem model was used to illustrate that neglecting the photosynthetic downregulation may significantly bias predictions of net primary production of the middle and high latitudes under high atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Based on both review of field observations and results of simulations, the authors conclude that a more appropriate representation of plant physiology and choice of plant functional types may be required in ecosystem models in order to accurately simulate plant responses to changing environmental conditions.","Atmospheric CO2; Ecosystem models; Net primary production; Photosynthetic downregulation; Plant functional types","Atmospheric CO; Ecosystem model; Net primary production; Photosynthetic downregulation; Plant functional type; Climate change; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879312581

Current knowledge of the microwave emission from the deep ice sheet in Antarctica is limited by the lack of low-frequency satellite sensors and by their inadequate knowledge of the physical effects governing microwave emission at wavelengths exceeding 5 cm. On the other hand, in addition to the interest related to climatic changes and to glaciological and hydrological applications, there is growing interest, on the part of the remote sensing community, in using the Antarctic and, in particular, the Dome-C plateau where the Concordia station is located, for calibrating and validating data of satellite-borne microwave and optical radiometers. This is because of the size, structure, spatial homogeneity, and thermal stability of this area. With a view to the future launches of two new low-frequency spaceborne sensors Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission and Aquarius, an experiment was carried out at Dome-C, thanks to financial support from European Space Agency, aimed at evaluating the stability and the absolute value of the L- and C-band brightness temperature Tb. This paper presents a report on the experimental campaign, the characteristics of the radiometric measurements, and on the main results. The C-band Tb data indicated a diurnal cycle amplitude of a few kelvin. It was confirmed that this takes place as a consequence of observed variability in the physical temperature of the top 4 m of the snowpack around the mean surface value of -24°C. In contrast, the L-band data indicated extremely stable Tb values of 192.32 K (1σ = 0. 18 K) and 190.77 K (1σ = 0.57 K) at θ = 45° and θ = 56°, respectively. © 2006 IEEE.","Antarctica; Calibration; L-band; Microwave radiometry; Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS)","Antarctica; Brightness temperatures; Experimental campaign; L-band; Microwave radiometry; Radiometric measurements; Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS); Soil moisture and ocean salinity missions; Calibration; Domes; Microwave devices; Satellites; Snow; Soil moisture; Microwave sensors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047183552

Mining practices, processing, the remote communities and support industries require vast amounts of specific quality water. Sustainability of water use has been a key factor in mine development, expansion of existing operations and increasing profitability of processes involving water. Developments in water treatment technology have enabled the use of a range of processes to produce this water reliably at ever decreasing costs. This increasing acceptance of new technologies has seen seawater desalination, recycling of plant wastewater streams, municipal wastewater reuse and others to become commonplace. Processes including seawater and groundwater reverse osmosis (RO), low pH RO, thermal desalination, high rate clarification, brine water treatment, ion exchange and other advanced treatment technologies are now used as part of mining operations. This paper surveys the trends in water treatment for the mining industry both in Australia and internationally with a review of technologies and case studies of operating plants. The key technologies are explained with an emphasis on the specific requirements for mining operations - unusual raw water, process and operations limitations, environmental concerns, as well as harsh climate.

Durability of carbon-supported Pt and Pt-alloy catalyst is evaluated under an accelerated voltage-cycling protocol, developed by analyzing idle-to-peak power load-transients of various automotive drive-cycles. Results indicate that Pt catalysts on conventional carbon supports (Pt/C) are unlikely to meet automotive durability target; however, given no loss in specificactivity over time, Pt-alloys are likely to be successful. Shutdown/startup of fuel cell stack and local fuel starvation are recognized as an accelerating mechanism for carbon-support corrosion. Conventional and corrosion-resistant supports are evaluated under an accelerated protocol (1.2V vs. RHE). Corrosion of these currently used supports induces unacceptable masstransport related performance loss at high current densities. Implementation of corrosion-resistant supports in high-performance electrodes, combined with controlled system strategies, will most likely lead to automotive carbon support durability targets being met. copyright The Electrochemical Society.",,"Catalyst activity; Corrosion resistance; Electrodes; Fuel cells; Mass transfer; Platinum alloys; Polyelectrolytes; Accelerated protocols; Automotive durability target; Carbon-support corrosion; Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM); Polymeric membranes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845273519

To fulfill the future emission limits there is a need for advanced aftertreatment devices. A comprehensive study was carried out focusing on the improvement of the DOC as one part of these systems, concerning high HC/CO conversion rates, low temperature light-off behaviour and high temperature aging stability, respectively. The first part of this study was published in [1]. Further evaluations using a high temperature DPF aging were carried out for the introduced systems. Again the substrate geometry and the catalytic coating were varied. The results from engine as well as vehicle tests show advantages in a highly systematic context by changing either geometrical or chemical factors. These results enable further improvement for the design of the exhaust system to pass the demanding emission legislation for high performance diesel powered passenger cars. Introduction of a DOC technology with partial exchange of Pt by Pd in the catalytic coating gives additional advantages with respect to stability of the system and cost reduction.

In this study, the health risk posed by 1,4-dioxane is assessed to investigate whether measures should be undertaken to reduce exposure to 1,4-dioxane. The notion of the margin of exposure (MOE), given by the ratio of no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) to actual or projected exposure level, is used to assess risk. In exposure assessment, two types of exposure channel are considered: (a) the use of consumer products that contain 1,4-dioxane and (b) the inhalation of air around high-emission plants. To estimate exposure via channel (a), we measured the concentration of 1,4-dioxane in consumer products and estimated the interindividual variability of exposure by Monte Carlo simulation that reflects the measured data. To estimate exposure via channel (b), we employed a local-level atmospheric dispersion model to estimate the concentration of 1,4-dioxane immediately around high-emission plants. For hazard assessment, we derived the inhalatory and oral NOAELs for liver adenomas and carcinomas and the uncertainty factor. The results suggest that measures are not needed to reduce exposure to 1,4-dioxane from consumer products. As for inhalation exposure around high-emission plants, some residents may be exposed to health risks if certain conservative analytical conditions are assumed. Even in this case, we conclude that it is not necessary for Plant A to stop the use of 1,4-dioxane immediately and that medium- to long-term emission reduction measures should be sufficient.",,"1,4-dioxane; dioxane; dioxane derivative; domestic chemical; surfactant; article; chemical industry; environmental exposure; human; industrial waste; Japan; pollutant; risk assessment; theoretical model; wind; Chemical Industry; Dioxanes; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Household Products; Humans; Industrial Waste; Japan; Models, Theoretical; Risk Assessment; Surface-Active Agents; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750584077

However, this type of regulation does not encourage process improvement and technological research to cut down emissions below compliance levels. On the other hand, market-based environmental regulatory models stimulate continued improvement of cleaner manufacturing practices by creating economic incentives for sustained emission reduction. This paper aims at furnishing regulators and manufacturers with a tool to assess the impact of future regulatory scenarios. In order to assess the impact of different regulations, this paper proposes a holistic model for commodity chemicals, pharmaceutical and specialties manufacturing operations including standard recycle and treatment options. This proposed work employs realistic chemical engineering models of pollution abatement operations in order to assess the feasibility of a treatment option, estimate its cost and expected emissions. Furthermore, this work introduces rigorous mathematical optimization techniques for designing regional emission reduction efforts at reasonable cost to manufacturers. This approach will offer plant managers a systematic tool to ascertain expected compliance cost of new environmental regulations and regulators a systematic methodology to design regulations considering manufacturers' budgets. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Although naturally fractured, the Midale Unit proved to be a good candidate for a miscible CO 2 flood. Encouraging results from a demonstration CO2 flood in a small part of the Midale Unit (± 2,000 acres) prompted an extensive study to evaluate the potential of the full-field CO2 flood. The study involved analytical modelling and several compositional simulation models, ranging from a small, element-of-symmetry model to the comprehensive, field-scale model. This paper describes the compositional simulation conducted on a large 3D model containing 40,000 grid blocks. The 204-well model covered 20 inverted nine-spot waterflood patterns and the CO 2 demonstration flood area including both vertical and horizontal wells, comprising approximately 25% of the total Unit. The reservoir fluid was characterized using a 9-component Peng-Robinson equation-of-state model. Pattern-based permeability anisotropy was a key parameter used to accurately match individual well response to the waterflood and the CO2 flood. A very good history match was obtained on both the field and the well scale. The tuned model was used to predict future reservoir performance under various operating and development scenarios. Various CO2 injection strategies were considered, including continuous CO2 flood, Water-Altemating-Gas (WAG), and hybrid WAG. Under each strategy a detailed sensitivity modelling was performed investigating the optimal CO2 volumes, injectivity, WAG ratio, and the benefits of pressure support and limiting the gas production. The study showed that incremental recoveries of 11 - 15% OOIP can be expected by implementing the optimized CO2 flood scenario. Results of the compositional model were then used to tune the streamline simulator for the full-field model. A full-field development plan was delivered in four months.",,"Field scale model; Grid blocks; Reservoir fluid; Vertical walls; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Horizontal wells; Mathematical models; Mechanical permeability; Three dimensional computer graphics; Well flooding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645704679

Pollution is the bad side of this relationship. The European Union took over this issue with the nitrates directive in 1991 and tends to intensify its action on water and extend it to the air and soil compartments. The IPCC directive constitutes an interesting integrative approach for intensive livestock production, willing to take into account the different sides of environmental protection in a consistent way. The economic and external costs and benefits potentially resulting from the European environmental policies have been partially estimated in impact assessment studies that underlie the elaboration of some of these policies (climate change, air pollution). A more comprehensive cost-benefit analysis remains to be realized at the European level, being aware anyway that local and individual situations may vary a lot. Beyond these immediate considerations, preserving its environment is probably a condition of sustainability (viability) and of social recognition for livestock production.

Each technology option is simulated in MATLAB using a backward facing algorithm to calculate the force and power requirement for the Indian urban drive cycle. The storage for the CNG and the fuel cell vehicles is designed to have driving range of 50% of the existing petrol vehicle. The simulation considers the part load efficiency vs. load characteristics for the computed ratings of the IC engine and the fuel cell. The analysis includes the transmission efficiency, motor efficiency and storage efficiencies. The comparison criteria used are the primary energy consumption (MJ/km), the cost (Rs./km) obtained by computing the annualized life cycle cost and dividing this by the annual vehicle travel and carbon dioxide emissions (g/km). For the primary energy analysis the energy required for extraction, processing of the fuel is also included. For the fuel cell vehicles, it is assumed that hydrogen is produced from natural gas through steam methane reforming. It is found that the fuel cell vehicles have the lowest primary energy consumption (1.3 MJ/km) as compared to the petrol and CNG vehicles (2.3 and 2.5 MJ/km respectively). The cost analysis is done based on existing prices in India and reveals that the CNG vehicle has the lowest cost (2.3 Rs./km) as compared to petrol (4.5 Rs./km). The fuel cell vehicles have a higher cost of 26 Rs./km mainly due to the higher fuel cell system cost (93% of the total cost). The CO2 emissions are lowest for the fuel cell vehicle with compressed hydrogen storage (98 g/km) as compared to the petrol vehicle (162 g/km). If the incremental annual cost of the fuel cell vehicle is divided by the annual CO2 reduction, the cost per kg of CO 2 is Rs. 334. The sensitivity analysis reveals the impact of fuel cell life, fuel cell price, relative price of natural gas and petrol on the cost analysis.

As the negative effects of global warming become more certain and more pervasive, the federal government of the United States has, to date, largely refused to take action. Hurricane Katrina (2005) and its aftermath not only provide a case study of the federal government's failure to take positive steps, but also its tendency to make regressive policy decisions on global warming. At the state, local and individual level, however, the problem of greenhouse gas emissions is beginning to receive the attention it deserves. As pressure for action mounts, the conflicting federal and local views have now reached the courts. The U.S. Supreme Court has decided to hear a case, brought by petitioning states, cities and public interest groups, demanding that the federal government regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Although this will be an important case, it is unlikely that the local interests will prevail and even a victory for the petitioners would have only a limited effect. The more important meaning of the case is an acknowledgement by at least one branch of the federal government that state and local pressures to take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions can no longer be ignored. Comprehensive action on greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. must come from the executive and legislative branches.","Global warming; Greenhouse gas emissions; Law; United States environmental policy","democracy; environmental policy; federal system; global warming; greenhouse effect; Hurricane Katrina 2005; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148968759

Recently, a detailed kinetic reaction scheme including over 20 reaction steps was proposed for the catalytic CO oxidation, NOx reduction, and hydrocarbon oxidation taking place in a three-way catalyst (TWC) converter, the most common reactor for detoxification of automobile exhaust gases. This reactor is typically operated with periodic variation of inlet oxygen concentration. For an unforced lumped model, we report results of the stoichiometric network analysis of a CO reaction subnetwork determining feedback loops, which cause the oscillations within certain regions of parameters in bifurcation diagrams constructed by numerical continuation techniques. For a forced system, numerical simulations of the CO oxidation reveal the existence of a perioddoubling route to chaos. The dependence of the rotation number on the amplitude and period of forcing shows a typical bifurcation structure of Arnold tongues ordered according to Farey sequences, and positive Lyapunov exponents for sufficiently large forcing amplitudes indicate the presence of chaotic dynamics. Multiple periodic and aperiodic time courses of outlet concentrations were also found in simulations using the lumped model with the full TWC kinetics. Numerical solutions of the distributed model in two geometric coordinates with the CO oxidation subnetwork consisting of several tens of nonlinear partial differential equations show oscillations of the outlet reactor concentrations and, in the presence of forcing, multiple periodic and aperiodic oscillations. Spatiotemporal concentration patterns illustrate the complexity of processes within the reactor. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749361261

Our aim has been to quantify and parameterise the urban aerosol source number flux F (particles m-2 s-1), in order to help improve how this source is represented in air quality and climate models. We applied an aerosol eddy covariance flux system 118.0 m above the city of Stockholm. This allowed us to measure the aerosol number flux for particles with diameters &gt;11 mn. Upward source fluxes dominated completely over deposition fluxes in the collected dataset. Therefore, the measured fluxes were regarded as a good approximation of the aerosol surface sources. Upward fluxes were parameterised using a traffic activity (TA) database, which is based on traffic intensity measurements. The footprint (area on the surface from which sources and sinks affect flux measurements, located at one point in space) of the eddy system covered road and building construction areas, forests and residential areas, as well as roads with high traffic density and smaller streets. We found pronounced diurnal cycles in the particle flux data, which were well correlated with the diurnal cycles in traffic activities, strongly supporting the conclusion that the major part of the aerosol fluxes was due to traffic emissions. The emission factor for the fleet mix in the measurement area EFfm=1.4±0.1 × 1014veh-1 km-1 was deduced. This agrees fairly well with other studies, although this study has an advantage of representing the actual effective emission from a mixed vehicle fleet. Emission from other sources, not traffic related, account for a F0=15±18 × 106 m-2 s-1. The urban aerosol source flux can then be written as F=EFfmTA+F0. In a second attempt to find a parameterisation, the friction velocity U* normalised with the average friction velocity U* has been included, F=EFfmTA(U*/U*)0.4 + F0. This parameterisation results in a somewhat reduced emission factor, 1.3 × 1014veh-1 km-1. When multiple linear regression factor, been used, two emission factors are found, one for light duty vehicles EF LDV=0.3±0.3×1014veh-1 km-1 and one for heavy-duty vehicles, EFHDV=19.8±4.0×1014veh-1 km-1, and F0=19±16×106 m-2s-1. The results show that during weekdays ∼70-80% of the emissions came from HDV. © 2006 Author(s).

The detection strategy is based on the formation of a fluorescent excimer when two pyrene groups are brought into close proximity upon hybridization of the probes with the target mRNA. The pyrene excimer has a long fluorescence lifetime (>40 ns) compared with that of cellular extracts (∼7 ns), allowing selective detection of the excimer using time-resolved emission spectra (TRES). Optimized probes were used to target a specific region of sensorin mRNA yielding a strong excimer emission peak at 485 nm in the presence of the target and no excimer emission in the absence of the target in buffer solution. While direct fluorescence measurement of neuronal extracts showed a strong fluorescent background, obscuring the detection of the excimer signal, time-resolved emission measurements indicated that the emission decay of the cellular extracts is ∼8 times faster than that of the pyrene excimer probes. Thus, using TRES of the pyrene probes, we are able to selectively detect mRNA in the presence of cellular extracts, demonstrating the potential for application of pyrene excimer probes for imaging mRNAs in cellular environments that have background fluorescence. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",,"buffer; cell extract; cell protein; messenger RNA; pyrene; sensorin; unclassified drug; cell extract; fluorescent dye; insect protein; messenger RNA; neuropeptide; pyrene derivative; animal cell; Aplysia; article; controlled study; fluorescence analysis; fluorescence spectroscopy; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; oligonucleotide probe; priority journal; protein secondary structure; RNA analysis; RNA hybridization; RNA sequence; sensory nerve cell; spectrophotometer; animal; chemistry; evaluation; genetics; methodology; nerve cell; spectrofluorometry; synthesis; time; Animals; Aplysia; Cell Extracts; Fluorescent Dyes; Insect Proteins; Neurons; Neuropeptides; Oligonucleotide Probes; Pyrenes; RNA, Messenger; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745138578

As a result, the accurate quantification of GHG emissions from the electrical utility industry is an important goal of GHG registries such as the California Climate Action Registry. However, there are a number of issues associated with the electrical utility industry that make it difficult to estimate GHG emissions for a given utility. One of the first issues to be addressed is definition of the entity to be inventoried and includes apportioning emissions based on ownership or management control. Indirect emissions associated with purchasing power on the spot market or from brokers can be very difficult to quantify because the original generator of the power may not be known and hence the emissions of GHG associated with that power can only be approximated. In addition, many integrated utilities have ownership in plants outside their service territory or state so issues associated with importation of power across registry boundaries can cause complexities in the summation of emissions. This paper will address the complexities in the development of a GHG emission inventory for a typical electrical utility and provide guidance on preparing such inventories.",,"Emission inventory estimates; Greenhouse gases; Indirect emissions; Management control; Electric utility industry; GHG emission estimation; Integrated utilities; Spot market; Air pollution control; Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Computational complexity; Greenhouses; Industrial management; Marketing; Industrial emissions; Electric power systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846188134

With the Council Decision 2002/358/EC of 25 April 2002 the European Union signed the Kyoto Protocol and agreed on an overall 8 per cent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels by the year 2012. This target has at the same time been fixed for every member state of the European Union. In the White Paper ""Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy"" the European Commission laid down the target to increase the share of renewable energies from 6 to 12 per cent by 2010. The production of electricity from renewable sources should be increased from 14,3 to 23,5 per cent by 2010. The White Paper also set a target for the production of electricity from wind power which should be increased to 40.000 MW also by 2010. In this scenario with a growing penetration of wind power and the use of DC inter-connectors, system operation may be at risk under certain conditions if changes to the existing power grid codes are not implemented. Power grid codes set in particular the requirements to fulfil for users of the transmission and distribution system. Such codes evolve to suit conventional generation, but substantial modifications are required to apply them to new forms of generation, particularly wind power. New power grid code requirements need to be constantly updated in compliance with new technology developments in order to allow an easier access to the transmission system for unconventional forms of generation, yet ensuring system security and reliability. Such modifications have been already done or are in the process of being developed, by many European countries in order to accommodate the massive wind power development. The purpose of this paper is to explain the new grid code requirements and assess their implications. An overview of interconnection requirements to a transmission system and a comparison among a group of European countries is given (Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Great Britain, and Norway). The countries chosen for such purpose are representative either for their experience in large scale wind power integration or for their interconnection to Union for the Co-ordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE).","Fault ride through; Frequency range; Grid code; Power control; Power factor; Wind power","Fault ride-through; Frequency ranges; Grid codes; Interconnection requirements; Large-scale wind power integrations; Power factors; Transmission and distribution systems; Union for the co-ordination of transmission of electricities; Electric power distribution; Electric power factor; Electricity; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International law; Power control; Risk perception; Technology transfer; Transmissions; Wind power; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876755697

In fact, these systems have a number of advantages with respect to more traditional energy conversion systems, such as, for instance, higher potential efficiency, flexibility for distributed generation, and reduced emissions, Accurate and physically representative numerical models are essential for the future development of energy conversion systems based on fuel cell technology. In the present paper, a general and detailed numerical model is proposed, in which all the quantities of interest are calculated locally, on the basis of general governing equations for the phenomena involved. The model proposed in this work is based on the solution of the appropriate set of partial differential equations that describe the phenomena that occur in the different parts of the fuel cell: 1) anodic compartment, which includes fuel channel, electrode and catalyst layer; 2) electrolyte; and 3) cathode compartment. To solve the momentum, energy and species conservation equations in the anodic and cathodic compartments, a finite element procedure is employed, based on the Characteristic Based Split (CBS) algorithm. The CBS, thanks to its generality and modularity, is able to successfully predict fuel cell performances. The results obtained from the simulations show a good agreement with other data available in the literature.

Traditionally, implementing model-predictive controllers (MPC) in the process industries has required creation of a fixed, linear, dynamic model that relates changes in each input to all outputs. Further, the vast majority of past projects described in the literature have been executed using extensive step tests to develop a linearized control model, using process model identification techniques. Such deliberate tests can be quite costly, disruptive, invasive, and lengthy in duration - often lasting many weeks or months in a large unit. We should mention that both of the plants described herein would have been be very difficult, if not impossible, to subject to extensive step tests in the traditional manner. This is because they suffer very large measured and unmeasured disturbances, have very long settling times, and because the disruption caused by step tests would be quite unacceptable for reasons of safety and product quality. We describe our experience in using economically optimal, plant-wide, adaptive multivariable controllers for stabilizing operations and improving profit without use of ANY step tests, and present two case histories: a lean oil gas absorption plant, and a refrigerated fractionation complex. These units obtain feed from pipelines and ship products directly to pipelines with no intermediate storage. We discuss the manifold benefits observed from use of an adaptive control approach in both instances: (1) The adaptive nature of the controller enabled it to maintain excellent performance in the face of changing process dynamics, with very large and frequent feed rate disturbances exceeding 200% within 30 minutes in one of the units. In contrast, fixed model MPC controllers are generally incapable of handling such large disturbances. (2) The particular software package chosen in this effort required only that the user specify the steady-state gains for each manipulated and disturbance variable against each controlled variable. These were determined without use of traditional step tests. (3) The projects were executed with negligible impact on normal plant operations using analytical process simulation models, developed in an office environment, with reliance only on plant design/historical data to provide the needed MPC controller inputs. (4) The adaptive MPC controllers showed excellent stability and their performance was deemed to be very good, no modeling or other tuning changes being required for over a year, despite huge intervening changes in product values and utility costs in one of the cases. Operator acceptance has been exceptional. In this work, we developed and calibrated steady-state simulation models against plant data for the processes in question and used these to develop the required MPC controller gains. The chosen MPC controller synthesizes the process dynamics on-line and also makes model adjustments automatically as conditions change.

Although the worldwide uniform-rate carbon tax (UCT) is thought to be a cost-effective method to reduce CO2 emissions, it places heavy economic burdens on developing countries. Because such a policy is likely to be opposed by developing countries and is against “common but differentiated responsibilities” of the UNFCCC, it is unlikely to be successfully implemented. This article discusses the effects of the worldwide differentiated-rate carbon tax from the policy viewpoint regarding environmental (CO2) and economic (gross domestic product) aspects. The tax, based on the imputed price of carbon (ICT), was compared with UCT by simulation analysis using the applied general equilibrium model. The world economy was classified into 15 industries and 14 regions in the model. Each tax was imposed on the upper industrial sectors. As ICT reduced CO2 emissions slightly less than UCT, it was found to generate positive GDP effects on developing countries, unlike UCT. With regard to the importance of worldwide introduction of CO2 abating policies and avoidance of excessive economic burdens on developing countries, ICT has higher economic equity and policy effectiveness than UCT. © 2006, Springer Japan.","Applied general equilibrium model; Carbon tax; Economic equity; Imputed price; Upper industrial sectors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919950474

Mitigation strategies of traffic impacts cannot be the same for every city: choices are influenced by several elements, including political, social and economic aspects, as well as city configuration, environment and mobility issues, among others. Central districts are the most congested and, especially in the developing nations, environmental aspects are serious, with impacts not only on quality of life but also on public health. Therefore the central areas of a growing number of cities are becoming the scene of experimental initiatives aimed to tackle this problem, and in most cases the approach is to discourage private traffic in favour of an improvement of public transport service, both in quality and quantity. In Beijing, congestion and environmental issues are of particular concern, not only because of the effects of the traffic itself but also in view of the ""Green Olympics"" initiative launched by the Government, that is promoting an environmental friendly Olympics in 2008. In this scenario an innovative project, called ITS-TAP (Intelligent Transport Systems for Traffic Air Pollution), has been launched in 2004 under the Sino-Italian Cooperation Programme promoted by the Italian Ministry of Environment and Territory, SEPA, the State Environment Protection Agency of China, and the Beijing Municipality. The approach aims to help reducing the traffic impacts on air pollution through a dynamic strategy activated on condition: based on real time traffic and environment data collected in the field, a predictor model indicates when air pollution will exceed established thresholds: accordingly, private cars will be prevented to enter the city central area for a proper period of time necessary to recover the situation. The restriction will not be generalised, but limited to the most polluting cars, the so-called yellow tag cars. At the same time, the concept provides for an optimization of bus public transport service, using new generation planning and AVL (Automatic Vehicle Localization) technology. The paper reports on this project, discussing the system configuration that includes a network of fixed and mobile air quality measurement systems; a traffic classification and counting system for the 22 lanes entering the second ring road; a bus service planning and AVL system for an experimental fleet of 200 buses; a data centre and a Decision Support System. The ITS-TAP system will be used by BEPB, the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau, and BPT, the Beijing Public Transport Holdings.

(APCI) has developed a unique Services & Solutions Business offering, built on a patent-pending business method, which establishes a web-based emissions network that combines, integrates and then optimizes a group of companies' emission-reduction plans to determine the lowest cost compliance strategy. The Emission Optimizer (EO) technology, developed to quickly create optimized strategies, can be used by networked companies within cap an trade programs to help create intergrated, low cost emission reduction strategies; by voluntary control regions to avoid new or further governmental regulations; by global companies to optimize their emission reduction strategy and keep it optimized as regulations flex; and by modeling groups tasked with assessing the economic mpact of proposed regulatory changes. The web-based management system, customized by Vision Monitor, integrates data from governmental agencies and the customers' forecasted point source emission levels and reduction projects as inputs to the EO. The EO develops a low cost strategy for the networked customers using state-ofthe-art mathematical- programming-based optimization techniques. A large-scale Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, customized for APCI by Advanced Process Combinatorics (APC) using APC's proprietary VirtECS solver technology, is used to determine the lowest compliance cost for the region. A subsequent Nonlinear Programming (NLP) problem, developed by APCI is used to determine the corresponding credit trades and prices. An EO case study was performed in the Houston-Galveston Area (HGA) by combining 10 individual companies emission reduction compliance plans. The HGA is classified as a ""serious"" ozone non-attain ment area. Each company operating in the area must achieve specific NOx emission level limitations, staged between 2003 and 2008.

However, there is increasing recognition that adaptation to some level of climate change will be necessary, even if a reduction in emissions is successful. This is inevitable as much of the predicted climate changes over the next 30-40 years have already been predetermined by past and present emissions of GHGs. Change is likely to be significant. Understanding what the risks are likely to be and how best to adapt to them is therefore central to any mature climate change strategy. However, the inevitable linkages between adaptation and mitigation measures represent a particular challenge. Focusing on the consequences of climate change for the urban environment (where most of the population is concentrated and where its impact is likely to be most keenly felt), this paper suggests preferred adaptation options and provides an evaluation of how these may act to reinforce or hamper mitigation efforts. For example, moves towards urban densification may contribute to the reduction of energy use, yet will have negative implications for adaptation. Having a better understanding of the synergies, conflicts and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation measures would make a valuable contribution to a more integrated climate policy and the effective climate-proofing of our towns and cities.","Environment; Social impact; Town & city planning","Climate change; Energy utilization; Greenhouse effect; Climate proofing; Greenhouse gas; Mitigation; Urban densification; Urban planning; climate change; climate effect; environmental impact; mitigation; synergism; town planning; urban ecosystem; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845324083

This requires models that can simulate many different common and alternative crops. However, very few plant growth models are available that ""easily"" can simulate the growth of many crops, and these models lack the scientific detail incorporated into crop-specific models. One option available is a suite of plant growth models based on the original plant growth model used in the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model. Various versions of the original EPIC plant growth model have been used in other models such as the Great Plains Framework for Agricultural Resource Management (GPFARM) DSS, Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and the Agricultural Land Management Alternatives with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) model. While these versions are quite similar, slight improvements have been made for specific model objectives. Unfortunately, improvements to individual models have generally not been incorporated into the other models. This paper discusses efforts to develop the Unified Plant Growth Model (UPGM) from existing EPIC-based plant growth models, recode and modularize the UPGM, and then enhance specific sub-modules (e.g., phenology, seedling emergence) for improved overall model predictive accuracy. Several issues involved with developing this generic plant growth model are also covered including developing default plant parameters, needed improvements for simulating many diverse agricultural management practices across different soils and environments (while keeping the model simple to use), and evaluation of both specific sub-modules and overall plant growth model.","Crop growth and development; Modeling; Phenology; Scaling; Seedling emergence","Agricultural land; Agricultural management practice; Agricultural resources; Assessment criteria; Crop growth; Different scale; Environmental policy integrated climate models; Geographic regions; Individual models; Overall-model; Phenology; Plant growth; Plant growth modeling; Plant parameters; Scaling; Seedling emergence; Soil and water assessment tool; Submodules; Water erosion prediction project models; Wind erosions; Artificial intelligence; Biology; Crops; Decision support systems; Models; Phenols; Water quality; Geologic models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858665703

For instance, adaptation to climate change has relatively recently come onto the policy agenda, as has the interaction between adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation. 'Integrated assessment' has therefore become a common approach that attempts to demonstrate the policy relevance of science. It is intended to inform policies that ultimately lead to better risk management of agro-ecosystems (amongst other objectives). Increasingly policy stakeholders also demand realistic assessments of uncertainties that are associated with the scenarios underpinning such integrated assessments. This requires quantitative, probabilistic evaluation of risks and opportunities associated with specific scenarios that need to supplement the overall, qualitative assessments. Such evaluations can help to cut through the complexity of policy related issues without sacrificing the holistic perspective needed to maintain policy relevance. Using climate change as an example, we explore the role of quantitative models for integrated assessments and argue that a nested modelling approach (eg. climate model - biophysical model - socio-economic model - engagement model) to address all relevant disciplines, stakeholders and scales not only provides the quantitative information needed, but is also a valuable process to negotiate the complexities of the policy domain. This process might help us move more quickly from impact assessments (ie. unadapted responses) to well-structured scenario planning with adaptation, a process that is both policy and response informing.","APSIM; Climate change; Integrated assessment; Policy; Simulation model","Agro-ecosystems; APSIM; Biophysical model; Climate variability and change; Cut-through; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Impact assessments; Integrated assessment; Key client; National assessment; Policy makers; Probabilistic evaluation; Qualitative assessments; Quantitative information; Quantitative models; Scenario Planning; Simulation model; Socio-economic model; Computer simulation; Economics; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Risk management; Risks; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858640281

Vehicles and other emission sources have caused increased levels of PM10 and ozone causing an increase in the number of violations to the daily and hour standards, respectively. Actions need to be taken in the short term to reduce and control air pollution. Results obtained in estimating the mobile source emission inventory for the MMA using the Mobile6 Mexico Model was presented. This model was specifically developed for the characteristics and driving patterns of the Mexican fleet and was applied for the fist time to the MMA. More than 1200 ton/day of air pollutants are emitted by mobile sources in the MMA. Emissions of CO were the highest followed by NOx and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. Private vehicles and taxis, light trucks, and motorcycles emit the largest amount of CO and HC emissions while urban and freight diesel trucks (HDDT) emit the largest amounts of NOx, SO2, and particles. It is convenient to update this emission inventory and evaluate the confidence of the parameters used.

The ecosystem of this Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in northeastern Alberta is sensitive to fluctuations in water levels of the numerous lakes, channels and perched basins, and attention has been focused in recent decades on the possibility of deleterious effects from climatic change and regulation of the Peace River by W.A.C. Bennett Dam. A network of eight Picea glauca tree-ring chronologies was developed, time series features of growth variation were summarized, and the chronologies were applied in a regression model to reconstruct an annual time series of early summer (July 11 to 20) water levels of Lake Athabasca for the period A.D. 1801-1999. Though statistically weak (R2 = 0.36), the reconstruction verifies adequately in cross-validation and is consistent with anecdotal written records of a dramatic decline in water levels in 1879-81. Correlation of reconstructed and observed water levels improves with smoothing. Gaussian smoothing (ten years and longer) identifies a major low centred on 1890. The differential growth responses among the sites as well as evidence from other tree-ring studies suggest the 1890 low was associated primarily with diminished Peace River flows. The 20th century is unusual in a long-term context for high-amplitude multi-decadal variations in tree growth and reconstructed water levels, but the timing of these more recent fluctuations appears unrelated to the building of the W.A.C. Bennett Dam. Further research is needed to better discriminate the tree-ring signal for lake-level variation from the signal due to localized precipitation. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Climate change; Data reduction; Lakes; Regression analysis; Water levels; Regression models; Tree-ring inferences; Water-level fluctuations; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847731815

All tests are conducted in a vacuum chamber with an ambient pressure of 0.0136 atm to simulate the high-altitude conditions. Experimental results show that the critical temperature needed to catalytically light-off fuel-rich methane/oxygen mixtures is reduced by the addition of small amounts of hydrogen to the mixture.

The effects of changing flow rate (residence time), equivalence ratio, and amount of hydrogen addition on the critical ignition temperature are investigated. The ability of the catalyst to sustain chemical reactions once the input power is turned off is also explored, and for most cases self-sustalnability is realized.

To remediate the anthrax-contaminated facility, chlorine dioxide gas was used to fumigate the affected spaces and destroy the spores. The fumigation required introducing chlorine dioxide (ClO2) into the areas at concentrations above 1000 parts-per-million by volume (ppmv). Although these concentrations were necessary to ensure that the fumigation was successful, there was concern that fugitive emissions could be released to the outside ambient air and impact the adjacent neighborhood. Therefore, monitoring public exposure to the fumigant and a potential degradation product was conducted during all fumigation operations to document that no ClO2 and/or chlorine (C12) were observed above the compounds' respective action levels. Chlorine dioxide has an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure level of 0.1 ppmv for an 8-hour time-weighted average. However, this value was established for workers and was not appropriate as an action level for a residential setting, which included young, elderly, and other sensitive populations. Therefore, site specific action levels were established at 25 parts-per-billion by volume (ppbv) for a 15-minute time-weighted average for C102 and 75 ppbv for a 15-minute time-weighted average for C12. In order to monitor for these compounds with the proper spatial and temporal resolution required, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) requested its Environmental Response Team (ERT) to develop a monitoring technique that would adequately address the above technical issues. The US EPA/ERT utilized its Trace Atmospheric Gas Analyzer (TAGA) laboratory to monitor for the compounds of concern. The method for monitoring ClO2 and ClO2 employed a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, which could be operated in either the mobile or stationary mode. Additionally, the TAGA provided detection limits for C1O2 and Cl2, which were in the low parts-per-trillion by volume (pptv) using 2 parent/daughter ion pairs for C1O2 and 3 parent/daughter ion pairs for C12, with all of the ion pairs being updated every second. Due to the extremely low detection limits and the high spatial and temporal resolution, the TAGA monitoring ensured that the community was not exposed to hazardous levels of C102 or C12 during the fumigation operations. Furthermore, the monitoring technique allowed the TAGA to be used as a diagnostic tool to locate sources of leaks from the building so that the fumigation team members could provide corrective action before the fugitive emission became a safety issue.",,"Air and Waste Management Association; Ambient air; Anthrax spores; Atmospheric gases; Chlorine dioxide; Corrective actions; Degradation products; Detection limits; Diagnostic tools; Environmental responses; Exposure levels; Fugitive emissions; Ion pairs; Monitoring techniques; Occupational Safety and Health administration; Parts-per-billion; Parts-per-million; Public exposure; Quality measurements; Residential setting; Site-specific; Team members; Temporal resolutions; Time-weighted average; Triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer; United States Environmental Protection agency; Volume concentrations; Washington; Agricultural engineering; Air pollution; Air quality; Arsenic compounds; Atmospherics; Buildings; Chlorine; Chlorine compounds; Degradation; Environmental engineering; Environmental Protection Agency; Fumigation; Fusion reactions; Health; Ions; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Monitoring; Nuclear physics; Occupational risks; Office buildings; Pest control; Photodegradation; Security of data; Spectrometers; Spectrometry; Sulfate minerals; Technology; Trace analysis; Waste management; Environmental protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52049089270

(EPA, AP-42) For a typical 240 ft2 automobile surface, the emissions are judged to be about 0.55 lbs VOC/ft2 of surface area. With anticipated MACT reductions, this could drop to about 31.77 lbs of VOC and about 0.13 lbs VOC/ft2. The development of an alternative material that can be manufactured in a controlled process reducing the emissions to the environment of volatile organic compounds for coating light trucks and automobiles has been developed. Based on several white and black color options, the amount of emissions from coating an automobile using this new technology reduces emissions from 0.13 lbs VOC/ft2 to actual emissions for the new product range from 0.0024 lbs VOC/ft2 to 0.0034 lbs VOC/ft 2 for the new product. This involves a combination of both reduced emissions by product design and by additional abatement required under regulations, the amount of VOC emissions to the atmosphere per car drops from 31.77 lbs VOC to a range from 0.576 lbs VOC to 0.816 lbs VOC per average vehicle depending upon color. Based on the production of 5,000,000 light trucks and vehicles per year, the difference between normal or expected production discharges of 79,425 tons of VOC emissions/year would be reduced to a range between 1440 tons of VOC and 2040 tons of VOC per year. This dramatic reduction would likely very positively affect air quality in the various vehicle manufacturing areas of the United States and, where applicable, in other nations. Based on preliminary data, the cost to the customer would be roughly the same or slightly reduced when compared with traditional paint coatings. Other features of the product is that it is repairable by relatively standard methods for damaged vehicles and can be manufactured to meet most every current color currently being used in vehicle manufacture. The result is designed to both meet current customer requirements and reduce dramatically environmental emissions.",,"Film technology; Light trucks; Long-lasting; Air pollution; Arsenic compounds; Automobiles; Chlorine compounds; Cladding (coating); Coatings; Elastomers; Environmental protection; Organic coatings; Organic compounds; Painting; Plastic products; Plasticity; Polymers; Sustainable development; Trucks; Volatile organic compounds; Plastic coatings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52349107516

Reductions of carbon emissions to the atmosphere includes strategies to not only capture and store carbon emissions from, for example, coal fired power plants, but also includes strategies such as increasing energy efficiency, greater use of renewable energy sources, and greater use of fuels that do not contain carbon (such as nuclear) or are carbon-neutral. Over the next several centuries most or all of the earth's fossil fuel reserves (about 4000 Gt-C) may be consumed, with the hope that carbon capture and storage (CCS) will minimize future greenhouse gas emissions to levels that are not dangerous to the planet. However, as discussed in this paper, it may not be possible for repositories to reliably store the massive amounts of carbon generated without imposing environmental risks. Further, while control of global warming is of Immediate concern, possibilities of other types of climate change exist. Abrupt changes could be triggered that, for example, might reduce the deep North Atlantic circulation and produce a cooling over much of the earth. Second, the earth has been in an Interglacial warm period for over 10,000 years, and if the climate cycles observed in the previous 500,000 years continue, it is possible that the earth will return to a colder period. Ultimately, control of global cooling may be a more challenging problem than control of global warming. If reduction of greenhouse gas emissions turns out not to be the complete solution to climate change mitigation requirements (which may involve both warming and cooling periods), what is? In this paper, earth-based and space-based techniques are explored that are designed to supplement greenhouse gas reduction approaches. While the strategies presented here may be futuristic and expensive, they do provide us with an outlook on controlling global climate change that may spawn ideas for other mitigation techniques. General design considerations are presented based on a global energy balance model to predict global temperature changes not only in response to changing greenhouse gas concentrations, but also to changing conditions In the earth system, such as the net incoming solar radiation or the planetary albedo. The approaches are Intended to perturb the earth's energy balance in a controllable manner. Today, for example, data show that the earth is not in an equilibrium energy state. About 1.0 W/m2 more energy is coming into the earth than is leaving, indicating that the earth is ""committed"" to this amount of global warming and its attendant consequences, even If greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere do not continue to increase. This energy Imbalance is equivalent to a further warming of 0.5 °C to 1 °C, comparable to the observed global warming that has occurred over the past century. One benefit of the supplemental mitigation techniques would be to help ""uncommit"" earth from such energy imbalances, as well as to provide a basis for addressing future climate change. ©2006 IEEE.","Climate change mitigation; Geo-engineering; Global cooling; Global warming","Aerosols; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Climate change mitigation; Global cooling; Global warming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549105345

The experiments were designed to investigate how shallow lake ecosystems respond to the addition of nutrients and planktivorous fish along a climate gradient. Nutrient additions increased sedimentary benthos densities and total biomass to a plateau at intermediate levels of nutrients. The effect was greater in the warmest localities. Beyond the saturation point a further increase in nutrient loading had different effects depending on locality. Only in the southernmost site (in Mediterranean Spain), did it induce a shift to a turbid phase and macrophyte disappearance. Thus there are breakpoints in the relationship with nutrients, leading to alternative sediment communities subsequent to the water alternative states. Presence offish increased the densities and biomass of sediment macroinvertebrates, more clearly in the more southern locality, where the fish Gambusia did not prey in the bottom animals. A stabilising role of macrophytes was observed by cutting them, samples taken three weeks after cutting indicated a higher effect of fish on the sediment community when macrophytes were not present. Nutrients tended also to increase densities of plant associated macro invertebrates at low levels with a flattening of response at intermediate levels and a decline at high levels. At high fish level the numbers and biomass of plant-associated macroinvertebrates were lowered in all cases, because of increased predation. However fish addition at low level in most cases had the opposite effect, because their predation pressure was not high and regeneration of nutrients through their activities might increase food availability and control invertebrate predators. Fish influenced especially community composition, because they prey selectively. Addition of fish at low densities increased macroinvertebrate diversity. A diel migratory cycle was observed in plant-associated macroinvertebrates, but only in the southerly locations. Latitudinal influences on the structure of the macroinvertebrate communities occur but that they operate indirectly. There was a prominent effect of nutrients on these communities so that starting trophy is very important. Fish effects are layered on these and depend to a large extent on the particular range of diet of the species involved. © Asociación Española de Limnología.","Benthos; Climate gradient; Fish predation; Mesocosms; Nutrient enrichment; Plant-associated macroinvertebrates; Shallow lakes","behavioral response; benthos; biomass; community structure; fish; latitudinal gradient; macroinvertebrate; nutrient enrichment; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Southern Europe; Spain; Sweden; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Animalia; Gambusia; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747058482

In this context, Portugal has developed technical studies aiming to set up a reference scenario until 2010 and to evaluate the compliance of the emission ceilings established to this target year. In addition to this reference scenario, high and low emission reduction scenarios were also defined. Notwithstanding 2010 scenarios, the same procedure was applied to 2005 and two reduction scenarios, high and low, were considered. This works intends to evaluate the impacts of these national emission reduction scenarios on the air quality in Portugal, verifying the fulfilment of the air quality thresholds for 2005 and 2010. A numerical modelling system was applied over Portugal to these hypothetical situations and results were compared to those from an application to a baseline year - 2001. The selected numerical system is the 3D chemistry-transport model CHIMERE, which uses data from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast as meteorological input. Assuming the 2001 simulated meteorological conditions, the results point towards a reasonable improvement of the air quality over Portugal. It forecasted a significant decrease of ozone levels, especially in the downwind urban areas of Lisbon and Porto. These results strengthen the importance of including the NEC emission scenarios into the national strategy for air quality management.","Air quality impact; Emissions scenarios; Legislation","air quality; conference proceeding; emission control; numerical model; three-dimensional modeling; transport process; urban atmosphere; Eurasia; Europe; Portugal; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148991059

The Vertical Radial Plume Mapping (VRPM) method has been demonstrated at a gas dispensing facility during August 2005 to measure emission fluxes of total VOC downwind of the pump islands at the site. The method uses ORS instrumentation to collect path-integrated concentration data across a plane to map the plume of contaminant. The RPM methodology and results from the study are presented. A time series of total VOC flux values downwind of the gas pumps at the site, and the prevailing wind direction (from normal to the plane of the VRPM configuration) at the time of the measurements was described. The average VOC flux from the entire dataset was 0.80 g/sec. The wind direction remained relatively constant throughout the campaign, and variations in flux values were probably due to differences in pumping activities during the measurement period. However, the flux values decrease sharply ∼ 17:02 local time, but this is due to a shift in the prevailing wind directions, which carried a portion of the emissions outside of the plane of the configuration. The station report indicated that 6600 gal of fuel were pumped during the measurement period. By comparing this data to the OP-FTIR measurements, the calculated VOC emission factor for the site is ∼ 1500 g of VOC for every 1000 gal of gasoline dispensed.

Particular emphasis has been placed on the capability to detect combustible species at levels as low as 5% LEL (Lower Explosion Limit) that result from recent safety codes. The overall program has been break down into two parts. The response of catalytic detectors to hydrocarbon gas leaks (natural gases and naphtha vapors) has been addressed in 2004 and the corresponding results have been already published (ASME paper 2005GT68875). This first work phase has shown a satisfactory response of selected catalytic bead sensors towards the hydrocarbon paraffin series up to C8. The second phase (2005) tackled the detection of CH4/ CO/ H 2/ N2(CO2) mixtures. In the authors' knowledge, there was a lack of data in the current literature as to the performances of catalytic detection for this specific class of fuels. A wide range of mixtures was tested to cover the extensive spectrum of medium and low BTU gas fuels, including: ""weak natural gas"", coal derived process gas (coke oven, blast furnace gas; COREX gas; etc.) and syngas. CO2 and N2 were used as inert components in concentrations from 20 to 80 % vol. This paper summarizes the results of this second evaluation phase. A satisfactory response to the different CH4/ CO/ H2/ N2(CO 2) mixtures has been obtained in terms of sensitivity, accuracy and detection limits which satisfies the requirements of current codes and standards. The overall program confirms the possibility to use catalytic bead sensors as a single detection technology for covering virtually all the gas turbine applications. This includes, apart from natural gas: LPG, light distillates (naphtha; gas condensates and NGL), ""weak"" natural gas, Medium &amp; Low BTU fuels (Coke Oven; Blast Furnace), hydrogen-rich fuels (refinery) and the syngas segments with however the notable exclusion of middle distillates (gasoil, kerosene).

The hydrology of this vast region of Australia is poorly understood due to the low level of information and gauging that are available. Any insights that can be gained from the few well gauged catchments that do exist can be valuable for predictions and water resource assessments in other poorly gauged or ungauged catchments in the region. To this end, the available rainfall and runoff data from Seventeen Mile Creek catchment are analyzed through the systematic and progressive development and testing of rainfall-runoff models of increasing complexity, by following the ""downward"" or ""top-down"" approach. This procedure resulted in a multiple bucket model (4 buckets in parallel). Modelling results suggest that the catchment's soils and the landscape in general have a high storage capacity, generating a significant fraction of delayed runoff, whereas saturation excess overland flow occurs only after heavy rainfall events. The sensitivity analyses carried out with the model with regard to soil depth and temporal rainfall variability revealed that total runoff from the catchment is more sensitive to rainfall variations than to soil depth variations, whereas the partitioning into individual components of runoff appears to be more influenced by soil depth variations. The catchment exhibits considerable inter-annual variability in runoff volumes and the greatest determinant of this variability turns out to be the seasonality of the climate, the timing of the wet season, and temporal patterns of the rainfall. The water balance is also affected by the underlying geology, nature of the soils and the landforms, and the type, density and dynamics of vegetation, although information pertaining to these is lacking.",,"catchment; hydrology; monsoon; rainfall-runoff modeling; runoff; sensitivity analysis; soil depth; streamflow; water resource; Australasia; Australia; Northern Territory; Seventeen Mile Creek",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750279910

Following the same philosophy adopted in the modeling of the initial base case for Rio de Janeiro, the one dimension trajectory model OZIPR was chosen to perform the simulation of the initial base case for São Paulo. Concentrations of speciated atmospheric VOC were measured in a characterization campaign carried out by CENPES and its partners from 3/30-4/2/ 2004. The model results followed the tendencies shown by the experimental data profiles, with a little better fitting of the peak hour value as compared to the overall daily profile.

So, we can get the information about impact of human activity on climate from radiation data. In this study, we took particular note of effect of aerosol on climate. Because aerosol particles have a great impact on climate change through causing air pollution, reducing solar radiation, changing cloud property and so on. And anthropogenic aerosol emission increased with economic growth. To clarify the relation between human activity and climate change, estimating effects of aerosol on climate is one of the significant issues.* The model that we used in this study is aerosol transport model called SPRINTARS [Takemura et al., 2000, 2002, 2005]. This model is coupled with CCSR/NIES/FRCGC Atmospheric General Circulation model and treats carbonaceous, sulfate, mineral dust and sea salt aerosols from various emission sources. There are two effects of aerosol particles on radiation. One is the direct effect that aerosol particles scatter and absorb radiation and the other is the indirect effect that aerosol particles change the property of cloud. Then the indirect effect can be divided into two categories and our model treats the first and second indirect effect. From comparing the model simulation results with the surface observed data for variables relating to radiation budget, we have a good correlation between observation and model simulation in seasonal and annual trends. Both data show that anthropogenic aerosol increase caused solar radiation decrease in the industrial regions such as China where economic development is happening. Then we calculate contributions of aerosol effect on radiation from our model simulations. The next step is analysis of changing dynamical hydrological cycle by aerosol effect in this region.",,"Aerosol effect; Aerosol particles; Aerosol transport model; Annual trends; Anthropogenic aerosols; Atmospheric general circulation models; Cloud properties; Economic development; Economic growths; Emission sources; General circulation model; Global irradiance; Good correlations; Human activities; Hydrological cycles; Indirect effects; Long-term variations; Mineral dust; Model simulation; Observed data; Radiation budget; Scattering and absorption; Sea salt aerosol; Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric radiation; Budget control; Dust; Economics; Gas absorption; Gas fuel analysis; Greenhouse gases; Precipitation (meteorology); Radiation effects; Solar radiation; Sun; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-75149136603

In this study, we report single vibronic level emission spectra of the Ã1B1 → X̃1A1 system of the carbene C35Cl2, which probes the vibrational structure of the X̃1A1 state up to ≈10 000 cm -1 above the vibrationless level. By the careful selection of bands where complete isotope and Ka′ selectivity in excitation was possible, we measured Ka′-sorted emission spectra in order to test the previously established hypothesis [M.-L. Liu, C.-L. Lee, A. Bezant, G. Tarczay, R. J. Clark, T. A. Miller and B.-C. Chang, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2003, 5, 1352] that unassigned lines lying above ≈5000 cm-1 belong to levels of the ã3B1 state. The K a′-sorting method discriminates between singlet and triplet levels via the (A″ - B̄″) rotational constant, which is significantly larger for pure triplet levels due to the larger equilibrium bond angle. In the region between 3500 and 9000 cm-1 above the vibrationless level of the X̃1A1 state, we find only a very modest increase in (A″ - B̄″), and ∼86% of the lines observed between 5000 and 9000 cm-1 can be assigned to X̃1A1 levels within 3 standard deviations of our Dunham expansion fit, which included more than 140 levels in total. A nearly complete set of Dunham parameters was determined for the C35Cl 2 isotopomer, and the X̃1A1 state term energies up to 4000 cm-1 are in excellent agreement with recent variational calculations of Tarczay, et al.

The Rio Cruces was a bicarbonate-rich aquatic ecosystem until January 2004, when a pulp mill began pouring &gt;40 t of sulphate (SO4) and 6 to 9 t of H2SO4 each day into the River. Soon after, black-necked swans, which take refuge in the Sanctuary, began to die and emigrate. Previous studies showed that the food of the birds, the submerged vascular plant Egeria densa, had been eliminated from areas of the Sanctuary affected by the mill's effluent. Here we describe the cause of this loss of plants and birds. E. densa is a C4 plant that uses calcium bicarbonate to compensate for low concentrations of CO2 in its local environment. Without calcium bicarbonate in the water, the plant photorespires, loses turgor, turns brown and dies. Here we demonstrate that the sulphate and acid dumped into the river by the pulp mill caused an anionic/cationic disequilibrium resulting in the precipitation of both Mg2+ and Ca2+ oxides-as brucite and portlandite-and other metallic (Fe, Al, Cu) oxides which enhanced the concentration of H+, thus perpetuating the ionic disequilibrium. Further, aqueous sulphate under light acidic conditions could precipitate gypsum, thus further removing calcium from the water. An ecologically and statistically significant loss of calcium bicarbonate (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05) is shown: samples of water affected by the mill's effluent contained 37% less (HCO3)-than those collected outside the area affected by the effluent. In a microcosm experiment, E. densa samples were exposed to no sulphate (4 replicates: control), 2.5 g l-1 of K2SO4 (4 replicates: Treatment 1), 4.9 g l-1 of K2SO4 (4 replicates: Treatment 2), and 9.8 g l-1 of K2SO4 (4 replicates: Treatment 3). Plants in the control microcosms produced oxygen through photosynthesis at a rate of 0.24 ml OK2SO4 g-1 h-1. Plants in Treatment 1 produced oxygen at half the rate of the controls: 0.11 ml O2 g-1 h-1. Plants in Treatment 2 produced oxygen at a rate of 0.003 ml OK2SO4 g-1 h-1 or 2 orders of magnitude lower than plants in the control microcosms. After only 8 h of exposure to the experimental conditions of Treatment 3, the plants produced oxygen at a rate of only 0.0001 ml OK2SO4 g-1 h-1 or 3 orders of magnitude lower than controls. Differences in oxygen production among the controls and treatments were statistically significant (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05). © Inter-Research 2006.","Bicarbonate salts; CCM; Egeria densa; Environmental disaster; Industrial pollution; Photosynthesis; Pulp mill",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247121540

The frictional contacts made of different grain sets or ore veins can be regarded as natural semiconductor/insulator junctions arising from the difference in electron states or work functions between the contacts. During seismic activities, such semiconductor/insulator junctions in natural fault zones would generate discharge plasmas that could be one of origins of seismo-electromagnetic phenomena.

Japanese Ministry of Transport set up a target of the GHG emission level of transport sector at 2008 to 2012 as 17% increasing level from 1990 level. In order to comply with this target, Ministry of Transport has been introduced two main environmental policies related on automobiles; those are mileage regulation by top runner method and Green taxes. While these two policies are expected to generate synergistic effects to reduction of CO2 emissions, these policies are also afraid to have possibilities for increasing CO2 emissions through traffic volumes induced by being decreased automobile use costs. This is called by rebound effect in the field of environment. Hence we evaluate regulatory effects of CO2 emissions included its rebound effects by applying the dynamic computable general equilibrium (DCGE) model. The model has characteristics of explicit formulation of the automobile related industrial and transport sector's behavior and household travel behavior. With the numerical simulations by this model, we identify reduced volumes of CO2 by introducing the mileage regulation by top runner method and Green taxes as present policies. The results are that the decreased rate of CO2 is 6% in 2010.

The study was carried out in 2004/05 and it involved field assessment of major hydropower stations, hydrological assessment of the major water courses where hydropower generation plants are located, climatic changes over the last 10 years and an assessment of the demand for electricity in Swaziland. The study showed that more than 90% of the electricity which Swaziland Electricity Board (SEB) provides to its customers is produced by hydropower while a small proportion is produced by diesel power. The study also showed that the capacity of SEB to generate hydropower is limited mainly by low water flows. It was found out that due to limited capacity to generate hydropower, SEB imports most of the electricity from ESKOM in South Africa and that in 2004 the imported power was more that 84% of the total electricity consumed in Swaziland. It was found out that the causes of low water flows were upstream abstractions and long-term drought conditions. This indicated that hydropower generation is now less favourable in Swaziland than it was in the 1970s, when the existing schemes were built or studied. The other cause for reduced availability of water for hydropower generation is deforestation and increasing land use pressure in the catchment leading to high sedimentation levels in reservoirs. It was concluded that, while the future of locally generated hydropower is limited by dwindling water flows, the capacity to generate more power can be increased by constructing additional dams. It was also recommended that deforestation and intensive cultivation of the catchment areas need to be controlled to reduce the sedimentation of hydropower reservoirs and that more dams should be constructed to counteract the effects of droughts on river flows. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary targets for geologic storage are sedimentary basins containing porous, saline water-saturated formations, oil and gas reservoirs, and deep, unmineable coals. Since, under most conditions in the subsurface, CO2 will be buoyant relative to the formation fluids, possible leakage from the injection intervals is a primary risk of geologic storage. The buoyancy of CO2 is counteracted, however, by naturally occurring low permeability seals, structural traps, and other chemical and physical processes, so the risk of leakage can be mitigated by a combination of careful site characterization, controlled injection, and monitoring. Regional assessments and field pilot tests are still needed, to provide critical knowledge and experience needed for large-scale deployment of geologic storage.

Particularly very high is concentration of sulfur dioxide and particulates. Emission rates percapita and per unit of GDP have been several times that of neighboring western countries, although the levels have been somewhat decreasing. Pollution is concentrated in the area of Silesian Coal Basin, which, for example, produced 23% of Poland's total SO2 emissions in 1992, though it occupies only 2% of the country's area. Contribution of abandoned hard-coal mines processes in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) to greenhouse gases pollution is discussed and a prognosis of future air pollution presented. During the last decades considerable improvements have been achieved in reducing air pollution in the country's industrial areas, usually as a result of the Government's efforts through legislative, regulatory and economic means. Also, monitoring of air quality has greatly improved during recent years. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) states report, between 1985 and 2004, the CO2 emissions decreased in Poland by more than 30%, SO2 by 40%, and particulate matter (PM) by 44%.

One of the effective methods proposed to meet this goad is micro gas turbine cogeneration, which is increasing in popularity in industry. In the present study, the performance of a cogeneration system in cold regions and the applicability of such a system to a sewage treatment plant is investigated. The anaerobic fermentation digester produces biogas as a suitable fuel input for a cogeneration system, and the use of this waste gas provides substantial emission and environmental improvements. Analysis of biogas production indicates that production is high in the hot season, while the heat energy demand is highest in the cold season. As a method for biogas storage to adapt to the delay between peak energy supply and peak energy demand, biogas hydrate formation is examined by laboratory experiments and simulations of integration into an existing cogeneration system. It is found that hydrate storage is a cost-effective storage solution for biogas generated by sewage treatment facilities. Also, it can be suggested necessary energy for the hydrate production.

The perennial open-ocean system occupies two orders of magnitude larger volume than the seasonal coastal system, however, the latter offers more extreme conditions (greater nitrate consumption leading to complete anoxia). Unlike the open-ocean system, the coastal system seems to have undergone a change (i.e., it has intensified) over the past few decades presumably due to enhanced nutrient loading from land. The two systems also differ from each other with regard to the modes of nitrous oxide (N2O) production: In the open-ocean suboxic zone, an accumulation of secondary nitrite (NO2-) is invariably accompanied by depletion of N2O whereas in the coastal suboxic zone high NO2- and very high N2O concentrations frequently co-occur, indicating, respectively, net consumption and net production of N2O by denitrifiers. The extents of heavier isotope enrichment in the combined nitrate and nitrite (NO3 -+NO2-) pool and in N2O in reducing waters appear to be considerably smaller in the coastal region, reflecting more varied sources/sinks and/or different isotopic fractionation factors.",,"coastal water; comparative study; denitrification; isotopic fractionation; nitrite; nitrous oxide; open ocean; source-sink dynamics; Arabian Sea; Asia; Eurasia; India; Indian Ocean; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845528162

Other advantages of this approach are an increase in char burnout and reduction in NOx emissions. However, in order to retrofit the existing boiler, approximately 30% O2 and 70% CO2 blend is required in the oxidizer stream. This leads to a decrease in the volume of combustion gases which subsequently changes the mixing pattern of oxidizer and coal particles inside the boiler. If coal particles and oxygen are not well mixed, NOx emissions will be altered due to local fuel rich pockets. In the present paper, an, axi-symmetric, 2-D computational model was developed using Fluent CFD code, for a 1,000 lb steam/hr ""A-frame"", water-tube research boiler to identify and optimize the key variables that influence the NOx emissions.

Over 90% of the world's heavy oil and bitumen trapped in sandstones and carbonates are deposited in Canada and Venezuela. Up to 80% of estimated reserves could be recovered by in-situ thermal operation. The current in-situ thermal technologies such as cyclic steam stimulation (CSS), steam flooding and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) are energy intensive and use large quantities of fresh water. Increasing pressure of environmental concerns and the threat of a carbon tax will make it imperative to find new oil extraction technologies that are less energy intensive and that use less water. Combining technologies in the form of hybrid steam-solvent processes offer the potential of higher oil rates and recoveries, but at less energy and water consumption than processes such as SAGD. At the Alberta Research Council, new hybrid steam-solvent processes have been undergoing development in recent years. The Expanding Solvent-SAGD (ES-SAGD)(1-2), is aimed at improving and extending SAGD performance by solvent addition to steam. The improvements include higher and faster drainage rates, lower energy and water requirements and reduced green house gas (GHG) emissions. The Thermal Solvent Hydrid process focuses on combining solvent with a small amount of steam in a VAPEX (vapour extraction) process(3-4). This process offers the potential of higher rates than cold solvent VAPEX at less energy consumption than SAGD. Hybrid steam-solvent processes, when fully developed, will extract oil at lower cost than SAGD and will also open currently marginal resources for exploitation, increasing oil reserves. This paper presents and discusses the principal concepts and key parameters for the new hybrid steam-solvent processes and compares expected performance to SAGD. Copyright 2006.

Though city efforts to reduce global warming potential (GWP) emissions may be low in the global context, effective transportation policies in cities will have obvious results. Taking the Kathmandu Valley as a case study, this paper makes an attempt to analyse the implication of different transportation policies for reducing vehicular emissions and energy consumption. This paper estimates and analyses current and future trends of energy demand and environmental emissions, especially CO2 and PM10 from passenger road transportation in the Kathmandu Valley. The study is based on the primary data collected at the busiest and longest inner city road. It uses the long range energy alternatives planning system framework to construct future scenarios up to 2025. It analyses future scenario implications mainly dealing with the introduction of trolley buses, promotion of public transportation, discouraging private vehicles and low occupancy public vehicles, increasing vehicular speed, and other transportation policies. The study estimated that the 637 million passenger-kilometres traveled in the study route during 2004 resulted in 34-8 million kg of CO2 emissions. The travel demand is estimated to multiply by 7-8 with a corresponding twelve-fold increase in CO2 emissions and a ten-fold increase in total suspended particles (TSP) emissions in the study route from 2004 to 2024 under a non-intervention scenario. This scenario analysis suggests that discouraging private vehicles, thereby promoting mass transportation operated by electricity, can reduce CO2 by 43-7% and TSP by 43-8% compared with a scenario of non-intervention. In addition to transportation policies, effective land-use planning and encouragement of nonmotorised transport can have more positive impacts. Since Nepal is the Himalayan Kingdom, having many glaciers and snow-fed rivers, it is in great risk of global warming. Therefore change should begin immediately.","Pollution; Roads & highways; Transport planning","Electricity; Energy utilization; Global warming; Vehicles; Total suspended particles (TSP); Transport planning; Vehicular emissions; Transportation; emission control; energy use; inner city area; land use planning; road transport; suspended particulate matter; traffic emission; transportation policy; Asia; Eurasia; Kathmandu Valley; Nepal; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845328801

Recently, a new approach for dealing with local buckling and the associated loss of effectiveness that does not utilise the concepts of either cross-sectional classification or effective cross-sectional properties has been developed; it is therefore particularly well suited to dealing with stainless steel. Originally the concept was restricted in application to closed sections. It is extended herein to cover both open and closed cross-sections. It is then incorporated in the procedures for designing columns and beam-columns based on the Eurocode approaches and it is shown that by making further modifications the accuracy of these methods can be significantly improved.

Because of the sequential nature of negotiations of the overall budget, the allocation also has to follow a sequential process. If power generators anticipate that their current behaviour will affect future allowance allocation, then this can distort today's decisions. Furthermore, the national allocation plans (NAPs) contain multiple provisions dealing with existing installations, what happens to their allocation when they close, and allocations to new entrants. We provide a framework to assess the economic incentives and distortions that provisions in NAPs can have on market prices, operation and investment decisions.

The CDM is documented as one of the new investment avenues in developing countries with huge amounts of foreign direct investment predicted till 2012.

Led by the Metropolitan Energy Commission, a number of local builders and environmentalists obtained a commitment from the Arizona Energy Office to fund the planning and design of the prototype community. As research progressed, the planners soon began to contemplate comprehensive extensions of their original idea, including energy and water conservation, solid waste reduction, and lower air pollution. “Solar village” soon became a much larger concept, and the community of Civano began to take shape. It was to be sustainable, and it was to incorporate many of the compact, life-enhancing, and socially integrated aspects of America's small towns.The goal of the Civano project is to demonstrate the marketability of sustainable community development on a large scale at affordable prices. This 820-acre traditional neighborhood development utilizes proven available technology to reduce natural resource usage substantially below current levels. The property is located on state trust land in the city of Tucson, southeast of Houghton and Irvington Roads; zoning in the area was modified to support the Civano project. At the time, Civano was the largest development experiment of its type, and perhaps still is.Though only completed through the first phase of construction, the Civano experiment has already yielded very interesting results in all areas of development research from water and energy conservation to planning methodology and standards testing. The following report, fourth in a series, shows the early results of energy and water use in Civano as compared to the city of Tucson before and after the implementation of mandatory national energy codes adopted in Tucson in 1995. The results are a testament to the effectiveness of the Sustainable Energy Standard as applied in Civano. The Civano project went mainstream in 2001, when the state trust land was auctioned to private developers.

For urban traffic control systems, there is a great demand for realization of signal control measures as soon as possible due to the urgency of the recent environmental situation. This paper describes a new traffic signal control for reducing vehicle CO2 emissions on an arterial road. First, we develop a model for estimating the emissions using the traffic delay and the number of stops a driver makes. Second, to find the optimal control parameters, we introduce a random search method with rapid convergence suitable for an online traffic control. We conduct experiments in Kawasaki to verify the effectiveness of our method. The experiments show that our approach decreases not only the emissions but also congestion and travel time significantly, compared to the method implemented in the real system.","Environmental load; Random search method; Traffic control system; Traffic signal control; Vehicle carbon dioxide emissions","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Online systems; Particulate emissions; Traffic signals; Vehicles; Environmental load; Random search method; Vehicle carbon dioxide emissions; Street traffic control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750908632

Partial least squares (PLS) was used to investigate the relationship (linearity) between number concentrations and the measured PM2.5 mass concentrations of chemical species. The data were obtained at the Ponca Street site and consisted of six days' measurements: 6, 7, 8, 18, 19 July, and 21 August 2002. The PLS analysis showed that the covariance between the data could be explained by 10 latent variables (LVs), but only the first four of these were sufficient to establish the linear relationship between the two data sets. More LVs could not make the model better. The four LVs were found to better explain the covariance between the large sized particles and the chemical species. A bilinear receptor model, PMF2, was then used to simultaneously analyze the size distribution and chemical composition data sets. The resolved sources were identified using information from number and mass contributions from each source (source profiles) as well as meteorological data. Twelve sources were identified: oil-fired power plant emissions, secondary nitrate I, local gasoline traffic, coal-fired power plant, secondary nitrate II, secondary sulfate, diesel emissions/bus maintenance, Quebec wildfire episode, nucleation, incinerator, airborne soil/road-way dust, and steel plant emissions. Local sources were mostly characterized by bi-modal number distributions. Regional sources were characterized by transport mode particles (0.2-0.5 μ m). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This non-uniformity in thickness has been studied in many papers, and it has been reported that it is improved by applying a pulse potential repeatedly to the coated material. Using a scratch test, we studied the local adhesion of DLC coated by PBII to SUS304 thin plates attached at several places in a trench-shaped cathode.

Most of non-ferrous smelters have been contributing to reduce atmospheric emissions of sulfur dioxide to acceptable levels, converting it to sulphuric acid and/or gypsum. However, some amount of SO2 gas is still emitted from isolated smelters. Furthermore, sulphuric acid is competing with involuntary elemental sulphur in the market. This situation puts the non-ferrous metallurgical industries to develop a new sulphur fixation process.

The radiative recombination efficiency of the main blue emission band (∼480 nm) is found to be significantly improved at all temperature regions and current levels when the additional ERL is introduced. For high injection currents If, i.e., large forward bias voltages Vf, a quenching of the EL intensity is observed for T<100 K for both LED structures, accompanying appearance of short-wavelength satellite emissions around 380-430 nm. Furthermore, the low-temperature intensity reduction of the main EL band is stronger for the LED without the ERL than with the ERL. For low If, i.e., small Vf, however, no quenching of the EL intensity is observed for both LEDs even below 100 K and the short-wavelength satellite emissions are significantly reduced. These results of the main blue emission and the short-wavelength satellite bands imply that the unusual evolution of the EL intensity with temperature and current is caused by variations of the actual potential field distribution due to both internal and external fields. They significantly influence the carrier capture efficiency by radiative recombination centers within the active MQW layer and the carrier escape out of the active regions into high-energy recombination centers responsible for the short-wavelength satellite emissions. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.",,"Electric potential; Electroluminescence; Semiconducting indium compounds; Semiconductor quantum wells; Electron reservoir layer; Potential field distribution; Radiative recombination; Temperature dependence; Light emitting diodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845767529

One of the main issues of these vehicles is the energy management in order to improve the overall fuel economy. The present investigation aims at identifying the best vehicle configuration and control strategy to reduce fuel consumption in a car powered by a fuel cell and equipped with two secondary energy storage devices: batteries and super-capacitors. To model the powertrain behavior an on purpose simulation program called ECoS has been developed and implemented in Matlab/Simulink. The fuel cell model is based on the Amphlett theory, whereas the battery and super-capacitor models also account for the charge/discharge efficiency. The analyzed powertrain is also equipped with an energy regeneration system to store braking energy.

However, an auction raises the costs for the regulated firms. This article identifies rules for free distribution of a portion of the allowances that satisfy a compensation goal for firms while maximizing the value of allowances that can be directed to public purposes.

The preservation of the environment is one of main concerns for the European Union and also for the electricity sector. Examples of this concern are: the publication in 2001 of the European Framework Directive to promote the production of electricity from renewable energy sources (RES), which defines indicative targets for each Member State and obligations regarding the implementation of mechanisms to promote the development of RES, but also the implementation of a system for guarantee of origin ( for instance, using a Tradable Green Certificate System to promote transparency and competition in the market); and the publication in 2003, of the European Directive that establishes the European Union Greenhouse Gas Trading Scheme (EU ETS), that started operation on January 2005, to contribute in a eco-efficient way to achieve the objectives of setting the limit of greenhouse gas emissions committed under the Kyoto Protocol in each Member State. Taking into account this framework, this paper analyses the evolution of the competition among different electricity production technologies (renewable or not) and establishes a possible relation between the price of CO2 allowances (now, in the EU ETS and in the future, in the Kyoto greenhouse gas trading scheme) and the mechanisms to support the electricity production by renewable energy, such as a green certificates system. The adopted approach compares the levelised generation cost of different electricity production technologies, ""conventional"" (pulverized coal, integrated gasification combined cycle and natural gas combined cycle) and renewable (large and small hydro, wind, biomass, photovoltaic and solar parabolic through), calculated for the period between 2005 and 2025. Two different fuel prices scenarios (high scenario and low scenario) and three scenarios for the market price of the CO2 allowances were used. The main conclusions of the study show that, in the long-term, with medium or high CO2 allowances market prices associated with high fuel prices, as ""conventional"" thermal generation has to internalise the costs of CO2 emissions, renewable energy technologies became competitive. In other scenarios for CO2 and fuel prices, the mechanisms of support for renewable technologies are needed to provide an additional financial compensation.","Greenhouse gas emissions allowances; Levelised generation cost; Tradable green certificates","Electricity production; European energy policy; Generation cost; Integrated gasification combined cycle; Natural gas combined cycles; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy technologies; Tradable green certificates; Coal; Commerce; Costs; Electricity; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International law; Pulverized fuel; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Technology; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876752862

Their presence is not limited to urban and workplace environment but in homes, offices, schools, and hospitals at concentrations often much higher than outdoors. As the number of chemical products created is still increasing, the study of the toxic effects of VOC mixtures requires the development of an effective and reproducible technique for in vitro exposure of cell culture to air pollutants as an alternative tool to in vivo tests. The aim of this work was to develop an in vitro exposure set-up for the assessment of the toxicity of single volatile chemicals and their mixtures on representative VOCs target tissues: skin and lung. We used a dynamic exposure module, named CULTEX®, where human derived cell lines from lung epithelium (A549) and keratinocytes (HaCaT) were exposed in an air/liquid interface to a low flow of air pollutants mixture as a close simulation of in vivo exposure. Exposure to toluene or benzene concentrations showed reproducible and dose-related direct toxic effects on both cell lines. Moreover, benzene or toluene induced an inflammatory response. The results obtained so far show the sensitivity and specificity of the overall CULTEX® exposure module that could allow one to conduct further investigations on the effects of mixture of air pollutants on these representative target tissues.","Dynamic exposure device; In vitro cytotoxicity; Inflammatory response; Volatile organic compounds","Air pollution; Benzene; Hospitals; Toluene; Toxicity; Volatile organic compounds; Dynamic exposure device; In vitro cytotoxicity; Inflammatory response; Target tissues; Medical problems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148936032

The use of the transition metal nitrates, instead of Al catalyst, led also to the formation of highly ordered mesoporous carbons having the same structure as CMK-3. The 2-dimensionally hexagonal p6mm structure was constructed from a regular array of uniform nanopores (typically 4-5 nm in diameter) and carbon frameworks (typically 4 nm in thickness). The state of the materials during the carbonization process was characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy of the metal elements. The results showed that metal nanoparticles, 25-40 nm in diameter, were embedded inside the mesoporous carbon networks. The nanoparticles were formed due to spontaneous reduction of the metal elements during carbonization, following the initial action as a catalyst for the polymerization of furfuryl alcohol. The magnetic hysteresis loop for the cobalt-containing carbon showed soft ferromagnetic behaviour at room temperature. In particular, the cobalt nanoparticles could be protected against acidic erosion by repeating impregnation and polymerization of furfuryl alcohol once more before its carbonization treatment. The process is proposed as a method for preparation of magnetically separable mesoporous carbons, for application as an adsorbent or catalyst support. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006.",,"Alcohols; Carbon; Carbonization; Cobalt compounds; Nanostructured materials; Synthesis (chemical); Acidic erosions; Nitrogen physisorption; Silica template; Spontaneous reduction; Mesoporous materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747595637

Elevated CO2, which increases plant carbon supply and demand for mineral nutrients, may change the composition of the EMF community, possibly altering nutrient uptake and ultimately forest productivity. To assess CO2 effects on EMF communities, we sampled mycorrhizae from the FACTS-I (Forest-Atmosphere Carbon Transfer and Storage) research site in Duke Forest, Orange County, North Carolina, USA, where Pinus taeda forest plots are maintained at either ambient or elevated CO2 (200 ppm above ambient) concentrations. Mycorrhizae were identified by DNA sequence similarity of the internal transcribed spacer ribosomal RNA gene region. EMF richness was very high; 72 distinct phylotypes were detected from 411 mycorrhizal samples. Overall EMF richness and diversity were not affected by elevated CO2, but increased CO2 concentrations altered the relative abundances of particular EMF taxa colonizing fine roots, increased prevalence of unique EMF species, and led to greater EMF community dissimilarity among individual study plots. Natural variation among plots in mean potential net nitrogen (N) mineralization rates was a key determinant of EMF community structure; increasing net N mineralization rate was negatively correlated with EMF richness and had differential effects on the abundance of particular EMF taxa. Our results predict that, at CO2 concentrations comparable to that predicted for the year 2050, EMF community composition and structure will change, but diversity will be maintained. In contrast, high soil N concentrations can negatively affect EMF diversity; this underscores the importance of considering CO2 effects on forest ecosystems in the context of background soil chemical parameters and other environmental perturbations such as acid deposition or fertilizer runoff. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Biodiversity; CO2; DNA sequencing; Ectomycorrhizal fungi; Forest productivity; Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE); Global change; Internal transcribed spacers (ITS); Mutualism","carbon dioxide; community structure; ectomycorrhiza; mineralization; nitrogen; nutrient availability; nutrient uptake; plant community; primary production; symbiosis; Duke Forest; North America; North Carolina; United States; Fungi; Pinus taeda; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; phosphorus; primer DNA; ribosomal spacer DNA; article; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; comparative study; ecology; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; loblolly pine; metabolism; mycorrhiza; physiology; plant root; symbiosis; tree; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; DNA Primers; DNA, Ribosomal Spacer; Ecology; Mycorrhizae; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Pinus taeda; Plant Roots; Symbiosis; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748533807

To investigate this phenomenon suitable microscale dispersion models must be used in order to give the right support to decision makers for air pollution control. Within these streets, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers and residents are likely to be exposed to pollutant concentrations exceeding current air quality standards. In this way people carried out an applied research choosing the ""V. Giuffrida"" street of Catania as a test canyon because this street shows both geometric features typical of an urban canyon and a lot of car traffic flowing during all the day. In the first step the authors carried out preliminary and suitable studies about street and surrounding buildings geometries, meteoclimatic local data, intensity of traffic flow in different hours of day and so on. In the second step a computational model of the street canyon has been developed taking into account all blocks of buildings on each side of the street according to the actual urban situation. The computational model has been done using K-ε turbulence model and under three wind directions and velocity values characteristic of the area.

The industrial development of coast has resulted in degradation of coastal ecosystems and diminishing the living resources of exclusive economic zone in form of coastal and marine biodiversity and Productivity. To protect coastal environment, it is very much important to study the coastal habitats, and their status and consequent formulate a plan for protection. As coastal zone is very much dynamic and is changing very fast, it is prime important to study them in a temporal domain for which satellite remote sensing is the best tool. The present study area is a part of Cochin coastal region, with geographic coordinates of 9° 45′ N and 76° 17′ E. Cochin is officially called ""Kochi"". It is a city situated in the southwestern part of India in the state of Kerala. With its location on the coast of the Arabian sea it has become since the 13 th century an important city center for economic and Business in this area. Moderate and high resolution satellite image products LANDSAT MSS, TM, ETM+ and IRS 1D LISS III were used to extract information on causative coastal land use/landform, bathymetry, erosion/accretion and subsequent define a plan for coastal zone management of this region. Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) of this region has been demarcated and overlaid over the classified image to find out various land use classes in this zone. As Cochin is the biggest harbor in Asia, it is prime important to see the changes of bathymetry in different times. The Naval Hydrographic Charts are obsolete old and not reliable as bathymetry changes are very fast. Satellite remote sensing data has a strong role in studying bathymetry an attempt has been made to derive bathymetry data from satellite image. The result is good however if the images in less suspended laden water are applied the result would be improved. Coastal landuse/landforms in various time periods and their quantification from multi-temporal satellite data have been processed. The result shows that being a dynamic coastal region, Cochin coastal area is prone to erosion and accretion in different parts. The satellite remote sensing data can be used to map erosion/accretion areas and quantity them into some extent. From the study, it is concluded that remote sensing data and GIS techniques can be used as a powerful tool for addressing various coastal issues including coastal zone management.",,"Arabian sea; Carbon sink; Coastal area; Coastal ecosystems; Coastal environments; Coastal habitats; Coastal issues; Coastal lands; Coastal regions; Coastal zone management; Exclusive economic zones; Geographic coordinates; Geographical information systems; High resolution satellite images; Industrial development; Land use class; LANDSAT; Marine biodiversity; Marine ecosystem; Multi-temporal; Oxygen sources; Remote sensing data; Satellite data; Satellite images; Satellite remote sensing; Satellite remote sensing data; Study areas; Temporal domain; Time-periods; Bathymetry; Biodiversity; Coastal engineering; Coastal zones; Degradation; Ecosystems; Regional planning; Remote sensing; Geographic information systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865617558

Under moderate reducing conditions, oxygen becomes the determining factor for maleic anhydride productivity and selectivity. As the oxygen becomes depleted, minor changes in butane conversion impacts the selectivity substantially. However, when VPO catalyst is pre-exposed to oxygen for a substantial period of time (as practiced in Circulating Fluidized Bed technology), selectivity may be improved and maleic anhydride yields four times the steady state operation values are achieved. As the butane-to-oxygen ratio rises above 1, carbon deposits onto the surface of the catalyst, resulting in lower activity and selectivity. Based on a detailed reaction engineering model, the re-oxidation rate of the adsorbed carbon is 1st order with respect to the carbon adsorption sites and 1/2 order in oxygen.

Since the 1960s, six North American suppliers, one by one, have closed their rayon operations, forcing temporary stockpiling followed by expensive requalification programs. Today, no North American suppliers remain. The underlying problem was textile-grade rayon was being used, and the market for textile-grade rayon continues to sharply decline. However, this problem is now solved for the foreseeable future as Raycarb C2™ carbon phenolic components from a sustainable rayon source, high tenacity tire-cord-grade rayon, are currently routinely and successfully flying. The demand for tire-cord rayon continues to grow for the growing high performance and run-flat tire market, where - as with nozzles and heat shields - no other materials perform as well as rayon-based materials. Beginning in 1996, Snecma Propulsion Solide (SPS) of France developed a process to carbonize high-tenacity rayon. Raycarb C2™ underwent full-scale static tests on Ariane 5 and French military SRMs beginning in 2000, and is now used in all Ariane 5 launches. More than ten Ariane 5 nozzles with C2 have flown successfully through mid 2006. The physical properties of C2 have been shown to be equivalent or better than carbonized rayon based on North American Rayon Company (NARC) precursor, the rayon precursor used for most current US SRM programs. C2-based carbon phenolic materials have proven to be a drop-in replacement. Every key US manufacturer of SRMs has static fire and/or laboratory evaluations of Raycarb C2™ fabric and/or Nelcote F-555/C2 prepreg in progress. Nelcote F-555/C2 has already flown successfully in one US SRM program and successfully been static fire tested three times in the Atlas V SRM.

For example, capturing one out of every 10000 photons from the sun would provide all the power the world currently uses. Approximately 75% of the solar radiation striking the upper atmosphere (1368 W/m2 = 8555 eV/sec/nm2) reaches the surface of the earth and most of this is in the form of photons with more than 1 eV of energy since water vapor and other atmospheric constituents effectively absorb energy below this threshold. In order to produce a one micron photovoltaic molecular film (composed of approximately 1000 layers of a molecule) with 10-20 percent efficiency, each molecule would have to create 1-3 eV/sec. Since the available solar radiation is in the 1-4 eV range, this implies ∼1-3 electron-hole pairs per second which biological systems currently achieve. As such, various organic molecules, some of which are biologically inspired, have been proposed as alternative building blocks for solar energy materials. In the first phase of our challenge project, we have performed calculations on a molecular triad composed of a fullerene, a porphyrin and a carotenoid polyene. By calculating electronic structures, approximate excited states and respective dipole transition rates, we have simulated charge transfer dynamics in a collection of molecules exposed to an appropriate bath of solar photons. The resulting time constants associated with capture of solar radiation in the form of a charge-separated state have been determined. In the first phase of this challenge project, only electronic excitations were considered in the kinetic Monte Carlo modeling. Furthermore, the low symmetry in the molecular triad made it relatively easy to identify charge transfer excitations. In this phase of the project we report four new computationally intensive investigations that are aimed at validating and extending the formalism. First, to justify the use of an approximate excited state formalism, we have performed analogous calculations of excited states on a much larger selection of molecules and atoms and compared these results to experiment. Second we have performed calculations entirely analogous to our earlier molecular-triad results on highly idealized and high-symmetry fullerene tubules. Third we have used and extended a recently developed method [15] to calculate all electron-hole-phonon interactions in these carbon nanotubes as well as the light-harvesting molecular triad. Fourth, in analogy to symmetry-breaking methods used for density-functional treatments of ferro- and ferri- magnetic ordering in molecular magnets, we have developed and tested a massively parallel computational method, employing coarse and fine-grain strategies, for identifying self trapped ferroelectric excited states in highly symmetric carbon nanotubes. These techniques allow us to determine charge-transfer excitations and to determine whether excited-states are to be viewed within a Franck-Condon or Marcus-Hush picture. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Charge transfer; Direct energy conversion; Ion exchange; Light; Sun; Upper atmosphere; Carbon based fuels; Environmentally-friendly; Global Security; Induced charges; Parallel simulations; Solar energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48649108882

This paper details normalization of FSs of N 2diluted H2 and HC systems to account for effects of fuel composition, temperature, pressure, jet diameter, inflow Reynolds number, and inflow velocity profile (plug, contoured nozzle; and parabolic, straight tube). Normalized results exemplify a sensitive accurate means of validating, globally, reduced chemical kinetic models at - 1 atm and the relatively low temperatures approximating the loss of non-premixed ""idealized"" flameholding, e.g., in scramjet combustors. Laminar FS is defined locally as maximum air input velocity, Uair, that sustains combustion of a counter-jet of g-fuel at extinction. It uniquely characterizes a fuel. And global axial strain rate at extinction (Uair normalized by nozzle or tube diameter, D n or t) can be compared directly with computed extinction limits, determined using either a 1-D Navier Stokes stream-function solution, using detailed transport and finite rate chemistry, or (better yet) a detailed 2-D Navier Stokes numerical simulation. The experimental results define an ""idealized flameholding reactivity scale"" that shows wide ranging (50 x) normalized FS's for various vaporized-liquid and gaseous HCs, including, in ascending order: JP-10, methane, JP-7, n-heptane, n-butane, propane, ethane, and ethylene. Results from Hz-air produce a unique and exceptionally strong flame that agree within -1 % of a recent 2-D numerically simulated FS for a 3 mm tube-OJB. Thus we suggest that experimental FS's and/or FS ratios, for various neat and blended HCs w/ and w/o additives, offer accurate global tests of chemical kinetic models at the Ts and Ps of extinction. In conclusion, we argue the FS approach is more direct and fundamental, for assessing, e.g., idealized scramjet flameholding potentials, than measurements of laminar burning velocity or blowout in a Perfectly Stirred Reactor, because the latter characterize premixed combustion in the absence of aerodynamic strain. And FS directly measures a chemical kinetic characteristic of non-premixed combustion at typical flameholding temperatures. It mimics conditions where g-fuels are typically injected into a subsonic flameholding recirculation zone that captures air, where the effects of aerodynamic strain and associated multi-component diffusion become important.",,"Counterflow Diffusion Flames (CFDF); Flame Strength (FS) extinction; Opposed Jet Burner (OJB) tools; Fire resistance; Gas burners; Jet engines; Laminar flow; Nozzles; Reynolds number; Hydrocarbons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249306542

Most nations have participated in the United Nations sponsored study of the climate change problem. A report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change constitutes a major summary of thinking on climate change science. Still, climate science is in a state of early development. Many scientists are so far unconvinced that global warming from human produced greenhouse gases is significant or harmful. Similarly the scientific and engineering basis to manage now increasing greenhouse gases is immature. Reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gases, should we become committed that we can and must consider undertaking that task, will require much broader consideration of the role of humans in earth's carbon cycle. Many of the policies and practices which are being put into place in the name of the Kyoto Protocol seem short sighted in that context. This paper undertakes a review of some Kyoto derived policy initiatives which seem inappropriate, or possibly even counter to science based policies which might be considered in the context of long term greenhouse gas management for the coming decades and centuries. Indeed some may derive from issues and goals which have very little to do with the climate change issue.

In April 2002, Brazilian Congress approved a law which created a stick and carrot policy to put the development of renewable energy (wind, biomass and small hydro) on the national agenda. The established policy was to be carried out in two phases, with the compulsory purchase by Eletrobrás of 3,300 MW of these sources up to 2006, and another additional 15% of the market annual expansion, with the goal of reaching 10% of the market supplied by those three sources in 20 years. At the same time, a levy on tariffs was also created with the same law, to allow Eletrobrás to cover the difference between the generation costs of competitive sources and the costs of these new sources During 2004 and 2005 the law was regulated by electricity regulatory agency and the federal government established different cap prices for each technology. Several regulations were passed and an auction in two phases was implemented in order to reach the designated goal of 3,300 MW. Mandatory dispatching of energy from these sources was included in the contracts, assuring it to be dispatched whenever it is available, so displacing thermal plants with higher operating marginal costs. Following the auction, 144 projects were contracted and the estimated energy was around 13,500 GWh. Projects were proportionately distributed among geographical regions. The bulk of the projects were able to avoid the emission of 2.8 million tonnes CO2 per year, since due to technical characteristics and legal definitions, all of them are must run sources, avoiding the necessity to dispatch any thermal energy. These preliminary estimates of CO2 reduction, based on Approved Consolidated Methodology 002 (UNFCCC), can produce, in terms of carbon credits, between 10 to 15% in the volume of the required subsidy introduced by the previously mentioned law. © 2006 IEEE.","Brazilian electricity sector; Green house gas; Incentive policies; Reneable energy","Biomass; Electric power systems; Natural gas; Nuclear energy; Electrical inflexibilities; Electricity regulatory agency; Incentive policies; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549120556

Although the corrosion of carbon is certainly not a new concern for fuel-cell developers, a number of fairly recent developments have brought this issue to the forefront. These concerns include the unique operating conditions of transportation applications, the discovery of a mechanism that results in higher-than-expected potentials (i.e., the reverse-current mechanism), and the use of certain materials (e.g., high surface area carbon supported catalysts with high Pt mass fractions). Since improvements in catalyst-support stability typically comes at the expense of performance (and/or cost), and these improvements alone will be insufficient for many applications, system-mitigation strategies are required. A number of system strategies that have been developed and demonstrated at UTC Power will be described. copyright The Electrochemical Society.",,"Carbon; Catalyst supports; Corrosion prevention; Oxidation; Stability; Carbon corrosion; Decay mechanism; System mitigation strategies; Transportation applications; Fuel cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847003648

The developed sensor has shown to overcome the limitations of conventional strain sensors - having the capability to measure macroscale strains in any desired direction over a finite surface area, which may be subjected to combined loading modes, including tension, compression, flexure, and shear. They have sufficient flexibility and toughness to accommodate most curved surfaces and corners in components and structures. The methodologies use high aspect ratio multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in order to take advantage of their capability to form efficient conductive network. The results will lead to tailoring of sensor performance, particularly sensitivity factor, by controlling conductive network and optimizing sensor design and fabrication. To date, sensitivity factor of almost 20 at 1 wt.% of MWNTs in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) has been achieved. The developed sensor can be used in various military and commercial applications, including macroscale strain sensing over a wide surface area (e.g. aircraft skin), high sensitivity strain sensing on stiff components, and crack detection at critical stress concentrated regions for health monitoring.

It is shown that the information provided by the analyzed concentrations is sufficient to reach a mathematically acceptable solution to the optimization, even when little information is available in the measurements. As compared to the use of measurements alone or of measurements and a background matrix, the use of kriging leads to a more homogeneous distribution of the corrections, both in space and time.

The concentration of ammonium, given the anaerobic conditions in traditional landfills, can remain significantly high for a very long period of time, as degradation does not take place and volatilisation is not significant (the pH is not high enough to considerably shift the equilibrium towards un-ionised ammonia). Recent years have witnessed a continuous enhancement of landfill technology in order to minimize uncontrolled emissions into the environment; bottom lining systems have been improved and more attention has been devoted to the study of the attenuation of the different chemicals in leachate in case of migration through the mineral barrier. Different natural materials have been considered for use as components of landfill liners in the last years and tested in order to evaluate the performance of the different alternatives. Among those materials, bentonite is often used, coupled with other materials in two different ways: in addition to in situ soil or in geocomposite clay liner (GCL). A lab-scale test was carried out in order to further investigate the influence of bentonite on the attenuation of ammonium in leachate passing through a landfill liner. Two different tests were conducted: a standardized batch test with pulverized bentonite and a batch test with compacted bentonite. The latter was proposed in order to better simulate the real conditions in a landfill liner. The two tests produced values for the partition coefficient Kd higher than the average measured for other natural materials usually utilized as components of landfill liners. Moreover, the two tests showed similar results, thus providing a further validation of the suitability of the standard batch test with pulverized bentonite. A thorough knowledge of attenuation processes of ammonium in landfill liners is the basis for the application of risk analysis models for the evaluation of the failure of bottom liners or their components. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The current course of environment and energy policy debate in the United States, however, suggests an alternative outcome: sector-based and/or inefficiently designed policies. This paper uses a collection of specialized, sector-based models in conjunction with a computable general equilibrium model of the economy to examine and compare these policies at an aggregate level. We examine the relative cost of different policies designed to achieve the same quantity of emission reductions. We find that excluding a limited number of sectors from an economy-wide policy does not significantly raise costs. Focusing policy solely on the electricity and transportation sectors doubles costs, however, and using non-market policies can raise cost by a factor of ten. These results are driven in part by, and are sensitive to, our modeling of pre-existing tax distortions. Copyright © 2006 by the IAEE.

Eleven cultivars with commercial potential were planted in three agro-climatic zones of Limpopo Province to determine GxE interaction for fruit yield.

Particulate organic carbon may be an important component in the increased soil carbon content. We measured particulate organic carbon [defined as organic carbon in the 53 to 2000 μm (0.002 to 0.08 in) size fraction] and mineral associated organic carbon (defined as the less than 53 μm (0.002 in) size fraction) at three locations in central Texas. Each location had a never-tilled native grassland site, a longterm agricultural site and a restored grassland on a previously tilled site. Organic carbon pool sizes varied in the surface 40 cm (16 in) of native grassland, restored grasslands and agricultural soils. The native grasslands contained the largest amounts of total organic carbon, while the restored grasslands and agricultural soils contained similar amounts of total organic carbon. Both particulate organic carbon and mineral associated carbon pools were reduced beyond the depth of tillage in the restored grass and agricultural soils compared to the native grassland soils. The restored grassland soils had a larger particulate organic carbon content than the agricultural soils, but the increase in particulate organic carbon was limited to the surface 5 cm (2 in) of soil. Trends in particulate organic carbon accumulation over time from nine to 30 years were not significant in this study.","Mineral associated carbon (MAC); Native grassland; Particulate organic carbon (POC); Soil quality; Total organic carbon (TOC)","grassland soil; particulate organic carbon; restoration ecology; soil carbon; soil organic matter; North America; Texas; United States; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845313019

Remediation of landfills by means of in-situ aeration is one possibility to reduce these emissions. By establishing aerobic conditions, biological processes in the landfill are accelerated. To investigate the effects of this remediation technology, lab-scale experiments with column tests have been carried out. The main goal of the present work is to characterize the changes of the carbon and nitrogen compounds in the aerated solid waste, the leachate and the gas phase under varying conditions. The results demonstrate a clear reduction of emissions and a stabilization of the organic matter. Furthermore, it is shown that both the intensity of aeration and the amount of water affect biological processes to a certain extent. Even when columns were operated under anaerobic conditions after a long running period of aeration, the emissions remained low. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, several states have also enacted legislation requiring control of mercury emissions from coal-burning plants. Mercury is a neurotoxin and accumulates within the food chain. Elemental mercury is difficult to capture from a gas stream. Much of the mercury contained in power plant flue gas is in the elemental form. Elemental mercury is a semi-noble metal, is insoluble in water, and is not captured efficiently by carbon. Mercuric chloride is highly soluble in water, and is more readily removed by carbon. A catalyst that can oxidize elemental mercury to mercuric chloride (or another compound) would be of tremendous value. A catalyst would enable mercury to be captured by existing air pollution control devices (APCDs) present in coal-burning power plants. These existing APCDs include wet scrubbers for acid gas removal, as well as electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) and baghouse filters for particulate removal. The mercury oxidation catalyst can be located upstream of the appropriate APCD. Mercuric chloride is readily removed by the scrubbing solutions employed for acid gas removal. Mercuric chloride is easily removed by adsorption on unburned carbon in fly ash captured in ESPs or baghouse filters. Mercuric chloride is also sequestered by activated carbon sorbents injected upstream of an ESP or baghouse. Several materials have been proposed as catalysts for oxidation of mercury. These materials include palladium, gold, iridium, platinum, SCR catalysts, fly ash, activated carbons, Thief carbons, and halogen compounds. Previous results obtained with these catalysts are reviewed. Several mechanisms of mercury oxidation are proposed, and future research directions are suggested. Alternative catalysts and supports will be suggested, and an extensive list of references will be provided.

The software is aimed at helping the user in the selection of the main characteristics of distributed generation systems by means of a methodology that calculates the avoided losses on the electrical grid and many other economical and technical indicators. The software can also be used to quantify the environmental benefits, to help in the feasibility studies of distributed generation systems and to manage the data and to control groups of small generation systems (Virtual Power Plant). The geo-referenced database of the present co-generation systems has been constructed on the Italian territory, with 1606 installations and approximately 12.000 MWe installed electric power. A complete database, which also includes all the other non-cogenerative distributed generation systems installed on the territory of Umbria, a small region in center of Italy, was prepared. This database is a powerful tool to characterize immediately the type of users that use cogeneration plants, to know the requirements of the market and to characterize and propose innovative energy conversion systems. Another characteristic is the possibility to perform feasibility studies of cogeneration systems. This instrument allows a significant simplification of the technical-economic evaluation procedures for the installation of an industrial or civil cogeneration system. The feasibility study can be combined with the calculation of electrical losses on the electricity transmission grid. The calculation of the avoided electrical losses, in terms of avoided CO2, offers a valid instrument to evaluate the environmental impact of different electrical generation systems and shows the advantages offered by distributed generation in the traditional generation park in Italy.

The analysis of carbon neutrality of MSW on life cycle basis shows that about 33% of the total CO2 emissions from Incineration of the waste are of fossil origin, which implies that MSW Is 67% carbon-neutral. The waste constitutes a ""renewable biofuel"" energy resource and energy from waste (EfW) can result in net CO2 emissions reduction. In this paper, we explore an exciting approach to extracting energy from MSW efficiently -EfW/gas turbine hybrid combined cycles. This approach innovates by delivering better performance with respect to energy efficiency and CO2 mitigation. In the combined cycles, the topping cycle consists of a gas turbine, while the bottoming cycle is a steam cycle or air cycle where the low quality fuel-waste is utilized. This paper assesses the viability of EfW/gas turbine hybrid combined cycles and analyses their thermodynamic advantages with the help of computer simulations. It was shown that the combined cycles could offer significantly higher efficiency of energy conversion and practical solutions to handling the waste.

High latitude lakes share many characteristics with those of temperate latitudes and are subject to many of the same landscape controls. However, polar lakes and their catchments also experience persistent low temperatures, extreme seasonality and severe freeze-thaw cycles and these distinguishing features are likely to amplify their responsiveness to landscape and climate change. General circulation models vary in their prediction of the future magnitude of regional climate change, but almost all converge on the conclusion that the polar regions will experience greater temperature increases than elsewhere and that these changes are likely to occur ever faster because of the positive feedback effects of melting snow and ice. Observations in the north polar region have shown that there have been significant rises in temperature throughout much of the area in recent decades, with effects on permafrost, lake ice cover, glacial extent and ice shelf break-up (Serreze et al. 2000, Mueller et al. 2003, ACIA 2004). Recent analysis of long term monitoring data from maritime Antarctic Signy Island (South Orkney Islands) and the McMurdo Dry Valleys in continental Antarctica has provided evidence of large regional variations in climate change and has shown that south polar lakes respond strongly to warming and cooling trends (Doran et al. 2002, Quayle et al. 2002, 2003). In this review, we take a two-step approach towards examining climatelandscape- lake interactions in high latitude environments. First, we examine the general effects of landscapes on lake ecosystems through factors such as geomorphology, solute transport, vegetation and hydrology. We then examine how these properties are linked to climate, resulting in a set of mechanisms whereby climate change can have pronounced impacts on lakes. Throughout this review, we have drawn on examples from both polar regions. Lake ecosystems are an important part of the Arctic landscape and there are limnological similarities to Antarctica. In both regions permanently frozen soils exert a strong influence on catchment properties such as hydrological processes and geochemical interactions. Similarly in both regions, snow and ice cover are major controls on the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. There is a long history of limnological research in high northern latitudes and much of this information is directly relevant to Antarctica. Current observations and model predictions indicate that the Arctic is much more sensitive to climate change and will continue to experience more rapid shifts in its temperature regime than Antarctica (Overland et al. 2004a, b). Much of the Subarctic and Arctic became ice-free in the early Holocene and the limnology and paleolimnology of northern lakes therefore provide a window into the potential future states of Antarctic lakes undergoing climate change. © 2006 Springer.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889971856

For example, despite proven emission control technology, burning low-sulfur coal is the most popular method to reduce sulfur emissions. Because the effectiveness and availability of technology to reduce mercury emissions is considerably less certain, burning low-mercury coal is a likely method to reduce mercury emissions. Like sulfur, the amount of mercury in U.S. coal shows substantial geographic variation. Furthermore, mercury emissions from similar types of power plants are largely correlated with the amount of mercury in the coal. However, unlike sulfur, mercury emissions also vary with the abundance of other elements in the coal such as chlorine and sulfur. Published equations (based on the part 3 ICR data from the USEPA), which predict mercury capture by existing emission control technologies, are used with selected coal quality data (part 2 ICR, COALQUAL, FERC 423 and CTRDB data sets) to predict mercury emissions from coal aggregated by U.S. county-of-origin. The results are used to map the potential uncontrolled mercury, sulfur, and chlorine emissions, as well as mercury emissions predicted for coal burned in power plants classified by emission controls. The maps indicate that much subbituminous and some lignite coal should comply with the proposed MACT rule using existing technology. Bituminous compliance coal for power plants with ESP controls is rare. Plants equipped with FGD controls may find bituminous compliance coal in the western U.S., the Eastern Interior Province, and the central Appalachian region. With notable exceptions, fabric filters appear to be an effective mercury control technology for most bituminous coal.",,"Mercury content; Mercury control; Mercury emissions; Sulfur emissions; Coal; Electric utilities; Laws and legislation; Particulate emissions; Regulatory compliance; Mercury (metal)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846232724

However, most emissions reduction programs do not formally recognize non-emitting generation as a tool for increasing air quality. By incorporating non-emitting capacity into emission reduction programs and policies, the cost of emission reductions could be reduced and the effectiveness increased. Non-emitting generating capacity has the least variable operating cost and is therefore called to run before fossil-fired power plants. Every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced by a non-emitting source is a kilowatt-hour that a fossil-fired plant did not produce. As a result, non-emitting generating capacity reduces emissions by preventing or avoiding emissions. For perspective, EPA's proposed Clean Air Interstate Rule would limit the sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in 28 states to 3,863,566 tons and 1,600,799 tons respectively in 2010. There are 91 nuclear plants in this 28-state region that prevented approximately 3.2 million tons of SO2 and 1.2 million tons of NOx in 2002 (source data: EPA, EIA) - nearly the amount of the proposed caps. Using a nationally recognized economic power markets model, analysis is underway to detail the impacts on both air emissions (SO2, NOx and CO2) and the cost of emissions reductions under various nuclear capacity scenarios, such as plant retirements, plant license renewals and new plant construction. This study expands on modeling work ongoing in the northeastern United States as part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). RGGI is analyzing a regional, electric industry cap on carbon dioxide (CO2). Using results from the RGGI work and this study focused on nuclear capacity, the value of nuclear energy to emission reduction programs and to fossil-fired capacity affected by those programs will be analyzed.",,"Air quality; Electric industry; Fossil fuel power plants; Industrial economics; Particulate emissions; Reduction; Emission reduction; Operating costs; Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI); Nuclear energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846209198

These communities are usually served by electric utilities with local distribution grids and many of these communities need to generate their own electric power, typically using diesel fuel. As a result, the cost of energy is many times higher in remote communities than in the rest of Canada as fuel transportation costs are high. Grid extensions are too costly or impractical for such communities. Small and micro hydro is an attractive renewable energy source for remote communities looking to reduce the high cost of energy production and to reduce GHG emissions.

It has however been demonstrated that a small amount of platinum group elements, the main active components in catalysts, are emitted during vehicle operation (Konig et al., 1992; Palacios et al., 2000; Moldovan et al., 2002) resulting in elevated concentrations of these normally rare metals in the urban and roadside environment (Gomez et al., 2002). While these metals were believed to remain in the urban and roadside environment, recent studies have suggested the possibility for regional and global dispersion of these elements. A 2-year project with the co-authors as partners and funded by the Alliance for Global Sustainability was initiated in 2002 to provide a further understanding of PGE transport from roadside environments.

The endothermic steam-methane reformation reaction can provide cooling and improved system efficiency when performed directly on the electrochemically active anode. Rapid kinetics of the endothermic reaction typically causes a localized temperature depression on the anode near the fuel inlet. It is desirable to extend the endothermic effect over more of the cell area and mitigate the associated differences in temperature on the cell to alleviate subsequent thermal stresses. In this study, modeling tools validated for the prediction of fuel use, on-cell methane reforming, and the distribution of temperature within SOFC stacks are employed to provide direction for modifying the catalytic activity of anode materials to control the methane conversion rate. Improvements in thermal management that can be achieved through on-cell reforming is predicted and discussed. Two operating scenarios are considered, one in which the methane fuel is fully pre-reformed and another in which a substantial percentage of the methane is reformed on-cell. For the latter, a range of catalytic activity is considered, and the predicted thermal effects on the cell are presented. Simulations of the cell electrochemical and thermal performance with and without on-cell reforming, including structural analyses, show a substantial decrease in thermal stresses for an on-cell reforming case with slowed methane conversion rate.",,"Endothermic steam methane reformation reaction; On cell reformation modeling; Rapid kinetics; System efficiency; Catalyst activity; Electrochemistry; Methane; Reaction kinetics; Thermal effects; Thermal stress; Solid oxide fuel cells",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845951307

The certainty that petrol-based sources of energy will be depleted one day is driving the search for alternative fuels. Bio-diesel as well as Bio-ethanol technologies are the key approaches to the reduction of CO 2 emission. They have matured technologically to a state-of-the-art status that allows for a relatively easy exploitation of such renewable resources within the present economical as well as legal systems and governmental regulations across national borders.

Two problems of broad concern are weakness of spatial and temporal resolution for climate data and incompatibility of data from different sources. The resolution problem can be only partially resolved by statistical approaches; more intensive climate monitoring would be required to provide spatial resolution compatible with current analytical needs. Several kinds of solutions are possible for the incompatibility problem, but no consensus has as yet been reached on which of these is most feasible. Metadata, which consist of site-specific information supplementary to the climate data themselves, are of much greater importance than has generally been appreciated and must be an important consideration in the collection and archiving of data. An obvious need exists for the development of hyperdatabases, which would consist of publicly accessible climate information brokering software with links to many different sources of climate data. Hyperdatabases would facilitate the creation of regional databases and their use in applications. Some efforts along these lines are in progress, but they need to be accelerated and broadened. In general, investments in information technology have not been well evaluated with respect to their effect on efficiency and utility of climate data; such an evaluation should be undertaken. Finally, the Cooperative Network is a key source of information on climate data in the United States, but its usefulness is hampered by slow archiving rates, which should be increased. The need for speed in archiving data should be balanced with a continuing need to maintain consistency of data collection, which is crucially important for time-series analysis. A suitable long-term goal for users of climate data in the United States is a complete history of climate data arranged as a four-dimensional matrix based on latitude, longitude, elevation, and time. The internal consistency and comprehensive nature of such a database would greatly stimulate analysis of climate data. © 2003 by the University Press of Colorado.

The analysis of the gases is performed by passing a constant flow of a sample gas from the tail-pipe into a 10L multi-pass cell. The absorption spectra within the cell are obtained using an FTIR spectrometer at 0.5cm-1 resolution along a 13.1m optical path. Additionally, the total flow from the exhaust is continuously measured from a differential pressure sensor on a Pilot tube installed at the exit of the exhaust. This configuration aims to obtain a good speciation capability by coadding spectra during 30 s and reporting the emission (in g/km) of both criteria and non-regulated pollutants, such as CO2, CO, NO, SO 2, NH3, HCHO and some NMHC, during predetermined driving cycles. The advantages and disadvantages of increasing the measurement frequency, as well as the effect of other parameters such as spectral resolution, cell volume and flow rate, are discussed. To test and evaluate the proposed technique, experiments were performed on a dynamometer running FTP-75 and typical driving cycles for the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) on a Toyota Prius hybrid vehicle. This car is an example of recent marketed automotive technology dedicated to reduced emissions, increasing the need for sensitive detection techniques. This study shows the potential of the proposed technique to measure and report in real time the emissions of a large variety of pollutants, even from a super ultra-low emission vehicle (SULEV). The emissions of HC's, NOx, CO and CO2 obtained here were compared to experiments performed in other locations with the same model vehicle. The proposed technique provides a tool for future studies comparing in detail the emissions of vehicles using alternative fuels and emission control systems.",,"analytical method; chemical composition; FTIR spectroscopy; measurement method; methodology; pollutant; testing method; traffic emission; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751528038

It is focused on the remote sensing, the plant and the climate and, for interdisciplinary relationships, the project working group consists of agronomists, engineers and physicists. The aims of the Project are: a) to produce a Decision Support System (DSS) combining remote sensing information, spatial data and simulation models to manage water resources in irrigation districts; b) to simulate irrigation scenarios to evaluate the effects of water stress on crop yield using agro-ecological indicators; c) to identify the most sensitive areas to drought risk in Southern Italy. The tools used in this Project will be: 1. Remote sensing images, topographic maps, soil and land use maps; 2. Geographic Information Systems; 3. Geostatistic methodologies; 4. Ground truth measurements (land use, canopy and soil temperatures, soil and plant water status, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Crop Water Stress Index, Leaf Area Index, actual evapotranspiration, crop coefficients, crop yield, agro-ecological indicators); 5.

The improved barium based technology shows an increased thermal stability in terms of upper not-to-exceed temperature of at least 50°C. Our data show that potassium based technologies can represent a viable solution for certain applications that require extremely high NOx-conversions at temperatures above 500°C. Potassium based technologies with improved anchoring of the alkali metal show significant reduction in potassium loss to the exhaust gas. After substantial aging on the engine bench the improved Ba-based technology showed NOx conversion of 63% in the FTP75 test cycle. In the fresh state NOx-conversions were some 85%.

The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, for example, has increased by more than 30% since pre-industrial times. Average global surface temperature has increased by approximately 0.6 ± 0.2°C since the late 19 th Century, and surface temperature records indicate that the 1990s are likely to have been the warmest decade of the last millennium. The anthropogenically-induced warming is superimposed on natural climatic variability. Proxy records show a regular oscillation, on a roughly 100, 000-year cycle, between glacials and interglacials. Superimposed on these long-term oscillations are shorter scale variations. It is thought that changes in the seasonality and location of radiation from the Sun trigger the onset or end of glaciation, and the change is then amplified by feedbacks in the earth-atmosphere system. A firm link between atmospheric composition and temperature has been established from ice core records spanning the last 420, 000 years, which show that changes in time of global temperature and atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane are tightly coupled. Global average surface temperature is projected to increase by between 1.4 and 5.8°C by 2100, with the warming being greatest over land and polar regions. Precipitation is predicted to increase in the tropical, mid- and high-latitude regions, but to decrease in the subtropical regions. Alternative energy technologies such as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will lower greenhouse gas emissions and reduce climate problems and costs. © 2006 Materials Research Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Earth atmosphere; Fuel cells; Global warming; Hydrogen fuels; Particulate emissions; Thermal effects; Anthropogenically-induced warming; Fossil fuel combustion; Global surface temperature; Fossil fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747366455

The model is based on regional well-log correlations, outcrop analysis and integration of biostratigraphy. Large-scale architectures are restored using a well-to-well correlation technique, after the well-log markers of the relevant surfaces of sequence stratigraphy are identified. This identification is achieved by comparing well-log signatures to lithological and sedimentological columns of nearby exposed sections. The subsurface dataset consists of 19 wells arranged in two east-west profiles, 341 km and 332 km long. The Jurassic sequenc e in Interior Oman shows a general easterly thinning wedge and includes two hiatuses with marked age-gaps. Three major depositional episodes are identified: (1) a Pliensbachian-Toarcian coastal encroachment in a southward direction, represented by the dominantly clastic deposition of the Lower Mafraq Formation upon the Permian carbonates; (2) a general late Bajocian marine flooding (hybrid facies of marginal-marine environments of the Upper Mafraq Formation), followed through the Bathonian-Callovian by the carbonate Dhruma-Tuwaiq System which evolved through time from a low-angle, homoclinal ramp dipping in a (north) westwards direction, to a purely aggradational, flat-topped platform (upper Dhruma and Tuwaiq Mountain formations); (3) a Kimmeridgian-Tithonian onlap in an eastwards direction of fine-grained limestones (Jubaila-Rayda) upon the post-Tuwaiq unconformity. Depositional hiatuses in the early Liassic and at the Early-Middle Jurassic transition are likely to reflect major eustatic sea-level lowstands. In contrast, subsurface correlations of the MFSs through the Dhruma-Tuwaiq indicate that the post-Tuwaiq unconformity is a low-angle (0.001 degrees) angular unconformity associated with tilting and truncation of the underlying sequences. Oxfordian sequences were probably never deposited in Interior Oman because of a lack of accommodation space and prolonged subaerial exposure. It is here proposed that the Upper/Middle Jurassic angular unconformity in Interior Oman was planed-off by subaerial carbonate dissolution during a steady, tectonically-driven uplift of the whole eastern Arabian shelf edge. The proposed geological model has several implications for the petroleum systems of Interior Oman. The geometric model predicts the distribution of the sedimentary facies, including source rocks, clastic and carbonate reservoirs, and seal facies. The occurrence of isolated Upper Mafraq-producing reservoir sands (i.e. Sayh Rawl field) are believed to be restricted to central and eastern Interior Oman. There are two other reservoir/seal combinations, both related to the Upper/Middle Jurassic unconformity: (1) truncation traps of the Dhruma-Tuwaiq below the unconformity (i.e. Hadriya and Uwainat reservoirs); (2) updip pinch-out trap of the Hanifa above the unconformity. Finally, it is believed that the early Late Jurassic general uplift and truncation of eastern Oman may have caused local remobilisation, updip migration, and loss to the surface of oil in reservoirs, initially generated from the prolific Al Huqf source rocks of Late Precambrian-Early Cambrian age.",,"Jurassic; sequence stratigraphy; Arabian Peninsula; Asia; Eurasia; Middle East; Oman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30344446240

The LSD protocol was initially developed in our center to cure primary hyperparathyroid (PHPT) patients with a high likelihood of a solitary parathyroid adenoma (PA) by minimally invasive radioguided surgery (MIRS). Since then, the same protocol has been applied to differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients with 131I-negative, but sestamibi-positive, locoregional recurrent disease in order to obtain radical radioguided extirpation of tumoral lesions at reoperation. Study Design: We reviewed the clinical charts of 453 consecutive patients referred at the surgical department at Padova University (Padova, Italy) to investigate a PHPT or a DTC recurrence: 336 patients (74.2%) met the inclusion criteria for radioguided surgery, and these patients were analyzed for the aim of this study. There were 298 patients affected by PHPT with a high likelihood of a solitary sestamibi-positive PA and 38 DTC patients affected by 131I-negative, but sestamibi-positive, locoregional recurrence. All patients underwent a preoperative imaging work-up, including sestamibi scintigraphy (double-tracer subtraction scan in PHPT patients and single-tracer, wash-out scan in DTC patients) and high-resolution neck ultrasonography (US). The LSD protocol we developed consists of the intravenous injection of a very low (1 mCi) sestamibi dose in the operating theater just 10 minutes before commencing intervention for the purpose of radioguided surgery only. At variance with the traditional ""high (20-25 mCi) sestamibi dose (HSD)"" protocol in which imaging and radioguided surgery are obtained in the same day, in the LSD protocol, imaging and radioguided surgery are performed in different days. The LSD protocol allows some advantages over the HSD protocol: (1) more time for acquiring and interpreting preoperative imaging (planar scintigraphy, single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], US); (2) an accurate selection of patients to whom MIRS is offered, especially in countries where the prevalence of nodular goiter with sestamibi-avid thyroid nodules (exclusion criteria for MIRS) is relatively high, as in mid-south-European countries; (3) it facilitates the work planning in the operating theater (bilateral neck exploration requires an operating time of at least double to that of MIRS); and (4) the radiation exposure dose to operating theater personnel is very low-substantially negligible, using the LSD protocol: This aspect assumes great importance in countries where radioproteximetric rules are stringent, as in Europe. Results: PHPT patients. MIRS was successfully performed by a 1.5-2-cm skin incision in 287 of 298 PHPT patients (96.3%) in whom such an approach was scheduled on the basis of preoperative imaging, including 41 of 57 patients (71.9%) who had previously received thyroid or unsuccessful parathyroid surgery in another center. No case of major intraoperative complication was recorded. No case of persistent or recurrent PHPT was observed during postsurgical follow-up. DTC patients. A total of 79 metastatic lesions were intraoperatively detected by the gamma probe and successfully removed (68 of them had been correctly visualized at preoperative sestamibi scintigraphy). During subsequent follow-up, 18 patients (72%) were considered disease-free, whereas 7 had persistent disease (increased serum thyroglobulin levels). The radiation exposure dose to the surgeon using the LSD protocol was 1.2 uSi/hour, that is, 20-30-fold lower than that delivered with the HSD protocol used for PHPT patients and with the 131I protocol used for DTC patients with recurrence. Conclusions: On the basis of our data, it can be concluded that the LSD protocol is a safe and effective protocol to perform in both MIRS in PHPT patients and radioguided reoperation in DTC patients with 131I-negative recurrence. Furthermore, from a radioproteximetric point of view, in comparison with other radioguided protocols used for the same purposes, the LSD protocol minimizes the radiation-exposure dose to the surgeon and operating theater personnel. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","""low sestamibi dose"" protocol; Differentiated thyroid carcinoma; Parathyroid adenoma; Primary hyperparathyroidism; Radioguided surgery; Recurrent disease","iodine 131; methoxy isobutyl isonitrile technetium tc 99m; pertechnetic acid tc 99m; potassium perchlorate; adult; aged; clinical protocol; drug efficacy; female; high risk patient; human; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; minimally invasive surgery; parathyroid adenoma; parathyroid scintiscanning; patient referral; primary hyperparathyroidism; priority journal; radiosurgery; recurrent cancer; reoperation; review; single photon emission computer tomography; thyroid cancer; Adenoma; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Parathyroid Neoplasms; Radiopharmaceuticals; Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi; Thyroid Neoplasms; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746332693

T2N 1N4, Canada","Environmental regulations have increasingly focused on mobile-source pollution and in particular on the automobile itself. More recently, focus has shifted toward the energy source used to propel vehicles. In the United States, in particular, the attainment of emissions standards at the local and regional level has led to a proliferation of special motor vehicle fuels. This has occurred because federal environmental standards must be achieved, but regional authorities are able to choose how to achieve those environmental standards. As a result, regional jurisdictions - sometimes as large as an entire state - have adopted specialized motor vehicle fuels also known as 'boutique' fuels. The heterogeneity in motor fuel markets created by this proliferation of fuel types has stressed an already taxed supply infrastructure and led to generally higher and more volatile gasoline prices. In this paper we provide a brief summary overview of the North American market for motor vehicle fuels with a particular emphasis on gasoline. We execute a statistical analysis of the price effects of the proliferation of unique blends of motor fuels in the achievement of federal environmental standards. We find that the effects of adding more fuels to the supply chain increases overall fuel prices, in particular for those areas using unique gasoline blends. In addition, the proliferation of unique gasoline blends increases the likelihood of supply disruptions, particularly in cities or areas that are isolated by virtue of using an uncommon motor fuel or because they are located far from sources of supply. The higher and more volatile prices of boutique motor fuels must be balanced against the environmental benefits of cleaner burning fuels.

The case study was conducted by interviewing nature-based tourism entrepreneurs in northern Finland and the Finnish Lake District, south east Finland. In general, the entrepreneurs were aware of the issue of global climate change. However, half of the interviewees did not believe that the phenomenon actually exists and will influence the region's tourism industry in the future. The scepticism towards the climate change may explain the fact that there were almost no adaptation strategies.

Originally an industrial zone, over time residential blocks have filled in the neighborhood, until now it is one of the country's most densely populated areas. The largest of these smelters is the Awadallah Secondary Lead Smelter, which began operation in 1979, and ceased smelting activities in 2001 as the Government of Egypt (GOE) encouraged smelters to move to new industrial zones and install up-to-date technology to reduce harmful emissions from the smelting process. Since 2001, the smelter facility has been used to refine and manufacture lead products. Knowing the 'state of the site', however, is only one part of the picture. It is also necessary to ascertain that the smelter imposed no adverse health effects on the people living in proximity to the smelter due to the high levels of lead contamination that exists in the study area. A screening epidemiological study determining blood lead levels - the best available index of body lead load - was conducted to provide further information on the potential impacts of lead contamination in the vicinity of the Awadallah Smelter. This allowed determination of the effect of environmental lead on the blood lead levels of children younger than 7 years of age (the most vulnerable to the harmful effects of lead), on females of reproductive age and on adult males. The study investigated the relationship between the blood lead levels of the target population with lead contamination of the indoor environment - household dust, drinking water, and interior paint. It was found that the outdoor environment, especially lead contamination of the soil, was the primary cause of elevated blood lead levels in residents. The lead levels of the test group varied from one zone to another, depending on soil lead levels. Another study was done three years after shutting down the smelter and cleaning a children's school situated in the study area, it was found that the blood lead level for most of the children in the school was within the allowable limit.",,"blood; conference proceeding; emission control; epidemiology; industrial emission; industrial location; lead; mining industry; pollution exposure; residential location; smelting; soil pollution; suburban area; Africa; Cairo [Cairo (GVR)]; Cairo [Egypt]; Egypt; North Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36249023180

Dry aerosol synthesis applying the flame spray pyrolysis was used for manufacture and directly (in-situ) deposit nanoparticles on sensor substrates. For the first time this technique has been used to synthesize a combination of two stacked porous layers for gas sensor fabrication. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, aerosol technology provides a direct and versatile method to produce homogeneous nanoparticle films. Two different sensing layers were deposited directly on interdigital ceramic substrates. These porous bottom layers consisted either of pure tin dioxide or palladium doped tin dioxide. The top layer was a palladium doped alumina nanoparticle film which served as a chemical filter. The fabricated gas sensors were tested with methane, CO and ethanol. In case of CH4 detection, the pure tin dioxide sensor with the Pd/Al2O3 filter layer showed higher sensor signals and significantly improved analyte selectivity with respect to water vapor compared to single tin dioxide films. At temperatures up to 250°C the Pd-doping of the tin dioxide strongly increased the sensitivity to all gases.

Energy forecasts indicate that the growing demand for electricity will require the construction of more electric power plant mat uses different fuels. In Spain, the growing electricity demand has been met with natural gas fuelled combined cycle electric power plant. While the air quality impact associated with the newer technologies is relatively lower when compared to older technologies, modern EU Air Qualify legislation requires the control of air quality impact in real-time and forecasting mode. An operational real-time forecasting decision support system system has been developed and implemented in Spain on a 4-unit (400 MW per unit) combined cycle electric power plant, which is located in the surrounding area of Madrid Community (Spain). The system is based on the MM5-C MAQ-EMIMO models system. The MM5 model is widely used all over the world and was developed by PSU/NCAR (USA). The CMAQ model is the so-called Community Multiscale Air Quality Modelling System developed by USEPA. EMTMO is an anthropogenic and biogenic air emissions model, which produces hourly emissions per pollutant per square kilometre. The system is implemented in an S-node PTV'-3. 4 GHz Dell computer cluster to minimize computation time. The system covers three model domains: 405 x 405 km with 9 km spatial resolution: SI x 99 km with 3 km spatial resolution; and 24 x 24 km with 1 km spatial resolution. The three domains have 23 vertical layers up to 100 mb. The system runs on a daily basis and forecasts up to 72 hours. The system runs all the scenarios needed to obtain the air quality impact of each of the 4-umts for every grid cell, hour and air pollutant simulated. The estimated electric power plant emissions are produced on a weekly basis and provided on-line to the modelling system. Changes to expected emissions for the electric power plant are introduced automatically in the modelling system on 3 daily basis. The system is accessed over the Internet by the environmental authorities and company managers on a daily basis. The system produces alerts every day according to the results of the model. Any decision related to possible shut-down for a limited period of time of the different power plant units, where the EU Directive limits may have been exceeded, is taken by environmental authorities in real-time. The system prototype was part of the EUREKA project TEAP (A tool to evaluate the air quality impact on industrial plant) (2001-2003). The same approach can be used for any other industrial plant and also for any emission source apportionment such as traffic over specific sections of the model domain or even specific pollutants over certain areas in the model domain.","Air Quality Modeling; Industrial impact; Real-time control","Air emissions; Air pollutants; Air quality impacts; Air quality modeling; Combined cycle; Community multi-scale air qualities; Computation time; Dell computers; Electric power; Electricity demands; Emission sources; Energy forecasts; Environmental Authority; EU directives; Grid cells; Growing demand; Industrial impact; MM5 models; Model domains; Per unit; Real-time forecasting; Spatial resolution; System prototype; Three models; Air quality; Artificial intelligence; C (programming language); Decision support systems; Electric power plants; Forecasting; Image resolution; Industrial emissions; Industrial plants; Pollution; Real time control; Laws and legislation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858665859

The modified CMAQ model (EPA USA, 2004) includes Poly-Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and Dibenzo-Furans (dioxins and furans). The model represents their cogeners as divided between gaseous and aerosol forms that exchange mass based on theoretical coefficients for gas to particle portioning. Modelled metals are Included in CMAQ as part of the non-reactive aerosol component. Metals modelled are: As, Cd, Ni and Pb. In additional Benzo(a)pyrene (PAH) is also modelled. The model is implemented in a cluster platform in order to be used as a real-time air quality forecasting system by using the ON-OFF approach. The emissions of the projected incinerator in the ON run are incorporated by using the height of the chimney, the prescribed exit gas velocity, diameter of chimney and the limit emission values (worst scenario) prescribed in the Directive/2000/76/CE. The OFF run is done by using EMEP POP and PAH emission inventory. The system is mounted over one mother domain of 400 × 400 km with 9 km spatial resolution and two nesting levels: 100 km model domain with 3 km spatial resolution and 24 km with 1 km spatial resolution. All model domains have 23 vertical layers. The highest level is located at 100 mb. The architecture domain system is centered at the UTM coordinates assigned for the projected incinerator.

This study aims to describe the impact that three meteorological variables (mixing height, wind speed and air temperature) on the ozone concentration, as well as reactive hydrocarbon (RHC) limitation and nitrogen oxide (NOx) limitation, have on ozone formation in the area. To achieve these objectives the California Institute of Technology (CIT) Eulerian air quality model was applied combined with the same methodology described in Baertsch-Ritter et al. [2004. Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics 4, 423-438] In addition, NOx and RHC emission inventory reductions were used to evaluate their sensitivities in the CIT model. A simulation of an episode occurring in the MASP on 22 August 2000, when a peak ozone level of 127 ppbv was recorded, is presented. In the CIT model results for the base case, primary pollutant concentrations and ozone concentrations are in good agreement with the measured data. In addition, changes in mixing height, wind speed and air temperature input files have the greatest effect on peak ozone in the MASP, and the isolated effect of RHC emission inventory reduction leads to 26% lower ozone levels than in the base case. Based on the results of this study, we can conclude that with reduction of RHC emission could provide the best scenario for promoting lower ozone concentrations in the MASP. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, engine manufacturers are finding it more and more difficult to comply with these new regulations through in-cylinder optimization alone. As a result, exhaust after-treatment systems, namely diesel particulate traps, present additional means for meeting these strict requirements. A previous study demonstrated the potential for diesel particulate emissions reduction using neat Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) fuel and blends. The absence of sulfur in F-T fuels permits the use of more aggressively catalyzed traps, as sulfur poisoning is not an issue. Furthermore, the reduced particulate emissions of F-T fuels leads to increased time between trap regenerations, which in conjunction with advanced catalyst formulations reducing the temperatures required to initiate regeneration, may provide substantial improvements in trap durability and performance. However, the deposition of particulates from F-T fuels on the trap substrates and loading and regeneration of the trap with F-T particulates and F-T fuel have not been adequately addressed. In this study a 2002, six-cylinder, 5.9 liter, Cummins ISB 300 diesel engine, outfitted with a fully instrumented particulate trap, was subjected to a subset of the Euro III 13-mode test cycle under steady-state operating conditions. In order to investigate the fundamental fuel effects on particulate trap loading characteristics, un-catalyzed Cordierite substrates were loaded with particulates generated from neat F-T diesel and a low sulfur diesel (LSD). Trap temperature, pressure drop, particulate emissions, and gaseous exhaust composition were monitored before and after the trap.

Due to liberalization of the cost-cutting appraise and quick urbanization, the automobile inhabitants in Indian cities is increasing quickly. In India, over the past 50 years, about 37.2 million vehicles have been registered and this quantity can shoot up additional in the upcoming years. The raise in the increase of vehicles consequences in an raise in the claim for the power. The transportation segment in India is a most important energy-consuming segment. The claim for energy is possible to raise exponentially above the next few years. The key dispute in front of India at present, is bottlenecks in power contribute which may establish a limitation for financial development. Ensuring an adequate contribute of energy to the transportation segment should be an instant apprehension taking into consideration that the transportation segment has straight implications for the economic classification. An added interconnected complexity in face of the eal1h at present is ecological contamination. The raise in amount of automobiles would absolutely get inferior the air supremacy in the opportunity. This would result in physical situation troubles as well as reduce in visibility through crest hours in Indian cities giving rise to highway security concerns. It makes sense to find environmentally sociable forms of power to get better the excellence of metropolitan living. To protect the physical condition of the humanity at huge, some major strategy decisions need to be implemented in order to manage the ecological contamination.

The grains in compacted powder absorb microwave energy selectively. Microwave-matter interaction creates thermal non-equilibrium state microscopically and enhances chemical reactions and the phase mixing at the grain boundaries very rapidly. The visible light spectroscopic techniques was used to monitor the progress of the reactions. Up to 650°C, the heated powders radiate the continuous spectrum of blackbody emission. The small non-equilibrium hot spots rise, move and finally burst in to brighter light emitting from all over the surface at 650°C. CN molecules and Fe (I) atoms were identified in the recorded spectrum. These bursts are similar to the ""ignition propagation"" normally observed in chemical reactions. The line spectra originated from CO molecules have not been detected yet. The solid-solid reaction could be expected between the iron oxides and carbon to produce CO2 directly. A loss in the sample weight was accelerated during the excess-emission. These are the clear evidence that microwaves cause thermally non-equilibrium state and accelerate reduction process. The reduction of iron ore is completed at 1380°C and relatively very pure pig iron was produced. It should be noted that the impurity level of Mg, S, Si, P and Ti is only 5-10% of what is found in the pig irons produced by modem conventional blast furnaces in the steel industries. The necessary amount of carbon needed was 1/2 compared to conventional blast furnace to produce the unit weight of steel, if we applied renewable energy or nuclear power for the microwave excitations.","Carbon dioxide emission; Microwave energy; Pig iron; Thermally non-equilibrium","Carbon dioxide emission; Microwave energy; Thermally non-equilibrium; Blast furnaces; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Microwave devices; Renewable energy resources; Steel; Pig iron",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846050822

Air pollution from mobile sources has increased in recent years, due to increased numbers of vehicles on the road and miles traveled per vehicle. Historically, however, air pollution control courses have focused on stationary sources like utilities; mobile sources have been addressed only briefly. A number of universities are now recognizing this and are offering entire classes in Transportation and Air Quality/Environment. Objectives of this study were: (1) to conduct a survey of Transportation and Air Quality courses offered nationwide, and gather information concerning topics covered and perspectives; (2) to provide information to educators wishing to introduce a Transportation and Air Quality course. The survey was conducted using information from the Association of Environmental Science and Engineering Professors, internet searches, and e-mails to faculty. It was found that the most commonly offered air quality courses in U.S. Environmental Engineering and Science graduate programs are Introduction to Air Pollution, Air Pollution Control Engineering, Air Quality Modeling, Air Pollution Chemistry, and Air Pollution Meteorology. Six Civil & Environmental Engineering Departments currently offer classes in Transportation and Air Quality/Environment with a primary engineering component.

Improved methods for parameter estimation (especially for parameters important to runoff response) are needed and require data from a wide range of climate regimes throughout the world. Accordingly, the GEWEX Hydrometeorology Panel (GHP) endorsed the concept of an international Model Parameter Estimation Project (MOPEX) at its Toronto meeting, August 1996. Phase I of MOPEX was funded by NOAA in financial year (FY) 1997, Phase II in FY 2000 and Phase III in FY 2003. MOPEX was adopted as a project of the IAHS/WMO Working Group on GEWEX and of the WMO Commission on Hydrology (CHy), and is now a contributor to the Combined Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP) of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). In 2004, MOPEX became a Working Group of the IAHS Prediction in Ungauged Basins (PUB) Initiative. MOPEX is also expected to contribute to the work of the Hydrologic Ensemble Prediction Experiment (HEPEX). The primary goal of MOPEX is to develop techniques for the a priori estimation of the parameters used in land surface parameterization schemes of atmospheric models and in hydrological models. A major early effort of MOPEX has been to assemble a large number of high-quality historical hydrometeorological and river basin characteristics data sets for a wide range of river basins (500-10 000 km2) throughout the world. MOPEX data sets are available via the Internet (ftp://hydrology.nws. noaa.gov/pub/gcip/mopex/US_Data/). This paper documents the development of data sets for river basins in the USA. Several highly successful parameter estimation workshops have been organized by MOPEX. The first was held as part of the IAHS General Assembly in Birmingham, UK, in July 1999. The second workshop was hosted in April 2002 in Tucson, Arizona, USA, by the SAHRA/University of Arizona. The third MOPEX workshop was held as part of the IAHS General Assembly in Sapporo, Japan, July 2003. The fourth, in Paris, France, July 2005 was organized by the CEMAGREF in collaboration with the ENGREF, Météo France, National Weather Service and the SAHRA/University of Arizona. The fifth workshop was held as part of the IAHS Scientific Assembly, February 2005, Foz do Iguacu, Brazil. The purpose of the future phases of the project is to: (a) continue collecting additional international data sets; update data from the USA by adding recent years, including data for elevation zones in mountainous areas and refining energy forcing data; (b) continue to conduct international MOPEX workshops; (c) provide leadership to develop a better scientific understanding of how to improve procedures for a priori parameter estimation; (d) make a significant hydrological contribution to CEOP and PUB; and (e) demonstrate transferability of MOPEX results. The basic data collection strategy being used in MOPEX is to seek the most readily available and highest quality data first. During the next three years, analyses of the available MOPEX data sets by the international scientific community will be emphasized.","A priori; Calibration; Hydrological models; Parameters; Regionalisation; Transferability; Uncertainty","Calibration; Catchments; Computation theory; Earth atmosphere; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Parameter estimation; River basin projects; Hydrological models; Mopex data set; Project management; data acquisition; data set; estimation method; hydrological modeling; mountain region; project assessment; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845574915

The dose of ionizing irradiation was 30-50.4 Gy; a boost irradiation of 14 Gy was added for the pelvic region. All patients were intravenously injected with 1 mg/kg Photofrin II 24 h prior to the commencement of radiotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) controls and in some cases positron emission tomography (PET) were performed in short intervals. The mean follow-up was 12.9 months. Results: No major adverse events were noted. Minor adverse events consisted of mild diarrhea, nausea and skin reactions. A complete remission was observed in 4/12 patients. A reduction in local tumor volume of >45% was achieved in 4/12 patients. Stable disease was observed in 4/12 patients. 1 patient showed local disease progression after 5 months.

The cost level highly depends on the absolute level of emission reduction required and the capacity of economies to shift to a carbon-free mode of production. As a framework for understanding this transition and the policy-business interaction, a multi-region framework is used which integrates political decisions on global and regional emission targets, equity considerations, technical choice and the market dynamics of permits. Welfare maximization for each region, subject to production, investment, damage functions and emissions trading costs, results in regional permit threshold prices and a subsequent demand-supply adjustment to an average price. Based on this price, the optimal emission reductions for each region serve as target levels in reaction functions, leading to an iterative dynamic game and Nash equilibria of future emission permits allocation. The model is applied with stylized data for 11 world regions and four cases (business as usual, equal per capita, 10% reductions of baseline, stabilization). © 2006 Physica-Verlag Heidelberg.","emission reduction; Emissions trading; fair allocation; multi-regional dynamic game; Nash equilibrium; policy-business interaction; price adjustment; reaction function; technical choice",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895409291

The European Union (EU) aims at achieving the objectives presented in Article 2 of the European Treaty. This article describes a system of objectives that, due to its combination of economic, ecological and social issues, can generally be summarised with the term ""sustainable development"". In addition to Article 2 the principle of environmental policy integration (EPI) is based on Article 6 of the European Treaty, which reads as follows: ""Environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of the Community policies and activities, in particular with a view to promoting sustainable development."" In accordance with it, environmental protection is not a sectoral policy, but a cross-sectoral imperative. This does not mean that there is no need for environmental ministries, but that interfaces have to be established in other ministries. To this effect, environmental objectives must be integrated into the objectives of other policies (e.g., trade, energy, agriculture, etc.). In comparison to the central role of environmental policy in the process of European integration, it seems to be more sidelined in Asia. For example, according to Takahashi and Kato (2001) in ASEAN environmental protection - despite having a well established institutional structure - is suffering from rather weak fi nancial support. In addition, some critics have suggested that the nature of ASEAN cooperation might be inappropriate for dealing with environmental risks (Hamzah 2000, Tay 2000 quoted in Takahashi 2001). Already in 1997, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) concluded that the root cause of the poor state of the environment in the region was a failure of policy and institutions (ADB 1994). In contrast to the traditional political neglect of environmental issues in Asia is the fact that ecological degradation is becoming more and more a constraint on future economic development (ADB 2001). It seems to be likely that with increasing environmental pressure an understanding of environmental policy might emerge in Asia, which could be similar to the European interpretation: environmental policy is not a result but a prerequisite for successful economic integration. This likely political convergence due to similar experiences with economic development and political integration could be reason enough for more environmental cooperation between Asia and Europe. In addition, there is a much more pressing need to do so, because Europe and Asia are pursuing the same (industrial) model of wealth and they need the same global resource base for their industrial metabolism. The European model of wealth is largely based on a high level of resource consumption. The highly industrialised economy is capable of supplying citizens with an increasing amount of high-quality goods and services, almost at any time and at any place. However, this requires much energy (e.g., for transport and heating) and materials (e.g., for food and construction). Fortunately, Europe can produce a growing value of goods and services with less material and energy input. To some extent, material and energy consumption has been decoupled from economic growth (relative decoupling). This means that even though Europeans do not use less resources in absolute terms (absolute decoupling), the increase is no longer proportional to the growth rates of the economy. With the relatively lower resource input negative impacts on nature and human health have also been decreasing (EEA, 2003, p. 17). There are a number of success stories of European environmental policy. Compared to the 1970s when most European citizens became aware of environmental problems, the European Union has achieved what Article 2 of the EU Treaty refers to as ""a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment"", notably in the areas of water and air quality. The European Union has been a driver of progress by passing ambitious environmental legislation. However, the main thrust of this legislation was reactive, and has mainly aimed at using ""end-of-pipe"" measures. This has led to substantial investments, for example, in air filter and wastewater treatment installations. According to the European Commission's estimates (CEC 2000) for two decades (1990-2010) the implementation of seven directives in the area of water and air protection required capital expenditure of around EUR 230 billion, with annual operating costs of around EUR 10 billion. These massive investments have not only improved the quality of the environment, but also created around 300,000 jobs in a highly competitive European eco-industry. Although the joint Community legislation (the so-called aquis communautaire) has led to a healthier environment in the European Union, there is still a considerable gap between the 'old' and the 'new' Member States. This is not only true for Central and Eastern European countries but also with regard to the southern EU Member States. For protecting the landscape and biological diversity of Europe and for a more harmonious implementation of the environmental acquis communautaire, the European Union will have to strengthen the environmental cohesion between south, north, east and west. Moreover with regards to increasing competitiveness and employment, the divide in resource-efficiency among Member States will have to be overcome (see figure 1). For Asia, high European environmental standards have a number of implications. On the one hand, the successful environmental protection in Europe shows that ambitious environmental standards and economic success are not contradictory. On the contrary, the richest nations seem to have the highest standards. On the other hand, environmental protection tends to be a very cost-intensive exercise. The strategy ""get rich first and clean up later"" has proven to be short-sighted, because it shifts costs of ""cleaning-up"" to future generations. It seems to be a more intelligent approach to act cautiously by preventing damage from occurring in the first place. In this light it would be recommendable to evaluate the European model of industrialisation. This would create the opportunity to learn from mistakes by avoiding damage to nature and human health including their expensive repair. Europe has learned that end-of-pipe solutions is the most cost-intensive option, because the economy suffers from damage inflicted on nature and humans and, in addition to that, it eventually will have to pay the repair. Therefore, European environmental policy tries to move away from end-of-pipe solutions by strict precautionary standards. For example, SO2 and NOx emissions from the burning of fossil fuels can be reduced by expensive filter technology. A more advanced solution is increasing energy efficiency. This will not only reduce costs for buying fossil fuels, but will also reduce SO2 and NOx emissions (including even emissions which cannot be filtered such as CO 2). © Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892349793

This paper discusses an EPA sponsored program for documenting and trading emission allowances associated with efficiency and renewable energy (EE/RE) projects. The paper also discusses a crucial element of EE/RE project allowance trading, the monitoring and verification (M&V) of actual emission reductions. One EPA rule, commonly known as the NOx SIP Call, requires several eastern states to submit air quality plans that address the regional transport of ground-level ozone through reductions in NOx emissions. As part of the NOx SIP Call, EPA provided guidance to states interested in developing an EE/RE set-aside. The Set-Aside is a pool of NOx allowances that are used to reward EE/RE projects that reduce electricity generation and thus NOx emissions. The EPA included an EE/RE set-aside in order to reward and recognize the benefits of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs. EE/RE Set-Aside Program background and the status of Program implementation in various states are discussed in the paper. Unfortunately, the quantification of EE/RE emission reductions is not often a straightforward process. Thus, this paper also reviews the M&V process that has been developed for the NOx Set-Aside Program. When designing and implementing an emissions trading program, the challenge associated with evaluation is balancing the cost, effort and rigor of various approaches with the value of the allowances and the need for fungible allowances. Two mechanisms for reducing the costs and effort associated with documentation and verification, while not reducing the integrity of the results, are: (a) program level aggregation of individual project emission allowances and (b) the use of standardized M&V Quality Assurance Guidelines. These two mechanisms and other recommendations are presented in the paper.",,"Electricity generation; Emission allowance; Energy efficiency projects; Trading programs; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Ozone; Project management; Quality assurance; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846186375

Emissions from diesel-powered buses and trucks are a major source of this air pollution. This paper summarizes the results from a pilot project aimed at testing whether advanced pollution-reducing technologies for diesel trucks and buses currently in use in the United States and Europe will work on Mexican buses and under Mexico City operating conditions. Diesel engines are the workhorses of buses in MCMA and many other regions; operators, vehicle and engine makers, and fuel suppliers have waited for each other to offer improved technologies. In this pilot project, 20 working buses in the Red de Transporte de Pasajeros del Distrito Federal (the Mexico City Diesel Bus Company) fleet were retrofitted with emissions control equipment and fueled with ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD). Results from emissions testing demonstrate that catalyst-based, diesel particulate filters can reduce particulate matter mass emissions by almost 90%. The project demonstrates that it is possible to have extremely clean buses operating in Mexico City by using commercially available technology and ULSD fuel. Even under Mexico City operating conditions and at Mexico City's altitude of 2,240 m, the existing buses in commercial service can greatly reduce the emissions of the pollutants dangerous to human health.",,"Air pollution; Diesel engines; Health care; Particulate emissions; Trucks; Diesel particulate filters; Fuel suppliers; Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD); Buses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947583100

However most, EU Member States prohibit the transfer of unused allowances from the period of 2005-2007 into the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, i.e. 2008-2012. At the same time, allowances appear to be allocated fairly generously to the emissions trading sector. In this paper, we first explore the implications of such a ban on banking when initial emission targets are lenient. This analysis is based on a simulation which was recently carried out in Germany with companies and with a student control group.

It is often speculated, but not yet proven, that climate change might influence the frequency and magnitude of certain hydro-meteorological natural hazards. What has certainly been observed is a sharp increase in financial losses caused by natural hazards worldwide. Although Europe appears to be less affected by catastrophic natural hazards than other parts of the world, the damages experienced here are certainly increasing. Natural hazards, climate change and, in particular, risk have therefore recently been put high on the political agenda of the EU. In the search for appropriate instruments for mitigating impacts of natural hazards and climate change, as well as risks, the integration of these factors into spatial planning practices is constantly receiving higher attention, The focus of most approaches lies on single hazards and climate change mitigation strategies. The current paradigm shift of climate change mitigation to adaptation is used as a basis to draw conclusions and recommendations on what additional concepts could be incorporated into spatial planning practices, and for example, multi-hazard approaches are discussed as an important approach that should be developed further, A special focus lies on the definition and applicability of the terms natural hazard, vulnerability and risk in spatial planning practices. Especially risk concepts are so many-fold and complicated that their application in spatial planning has to be analysed most carefully. This PhD thesis is based on six published articles that describe the results of European research projects, which have elaborated strategies and tools for integrated communication and assessment practices on natural hazards and climate change impacts. The papers describe approaches on local, regional and European levels, both from theoretical and practical perspectives. Based on these, past, current and future potential spatial planning applications are reviewed and discussed. In conclusion it is recommended to shift from single hazard assessments to multi-hazard approaches, integrating potential climate change impacts. Vulnerability concepts should play a stronger role than at present, and adaptation to natural hazards and climate change should be more emphasized in relation to mitigation. Future spatial planning practices should also consider to be more interdisciplinary, i.e, to integrate as many stakeholders and experts as possible to ensure the sustainability of investments.","Climate change; Europe; Geologic hazards; Natural hazards; Risk assessment; Spatial planning; Vulnerability","climate change; disaster management; European Union; geological hazard; hazard assessment; hydrometeorology; natural hazard; risk assessment; spatial planning; stakeholder; sustainability; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846159202

In the scope of the project, existing global climate models from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were first downscaled to the Baltic Sea Region and selected case study areas, and then combined with topographical data. The resulting scenario maps of potential coastlines changes and flood prone areas were then analysed together with various relevant actors to discuss potential impacts on the territory, referring also to the socio economic system and development. The results of this process were structured in a set of tools, the Decision Support Frame, to better bridge the gap between climate change models and spatial planning by integrated scenario interpretation. The intensity and the sort of impacts that might affect the Baltic Sea coastal area will largely differ depending on the location of the assessed area. Generally, the northern part of the Baltic Sea Region faces a smaller problem of sea level rise as the postglacial rebound lessens its impact. Whereas northern Scandinavia still rebounds up to 9 mm/year, there is a subsidence of about 1 mm/year in some parts of the southern Baltic Sea coast. Land loss caused by inundation can be negligible in sparsely populated areas; however, for areas with a high population density and development areas for housing close to the shore, a similar land loss will be much more serious. The Decision Support Frame aims at guiding and supporting the discussion between the relevant planner and other stakeholders in defining necessities and possibilities of mitigation strategies. The Decision Support Frame found strong support from local and regional spatial planning authorities that can thus lead to timely decisions on integrated mitigation strategies.","Baltic Sea; Climate change; Coastal environment; Floods; Regional planning; Risk assessment; Sea-level changes; Transgression",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744788614

As part of its on-going effort to study odor generation and enhance their odor control system, Maine Energy discovered that a greater quantity of volatile organic compounds (VOC) are generated by the waste itself than had previously been estimated. The VOCs that were found are primarily light alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, and butanol, along with compounds such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), benzene, toluene, xylene, and others. These compounds are generated from the operation of diesel-fueled equipment in the facility's tipping building, and from the decomposition of the waste itself. The VOC generation also has a strong seasonal component, where generation is highest in the warmer summer weather, and lowest in the depths of winter. In the summer of 2005, Maine Energy undertook a pilot scale study of VOC control using a proprietary concentrator technology from Munters Corporation, Zeol Division of Amesbury, Massachusetts. A scaled-down version of their rotary zeolite concentrator was employed at Maine Energy over a six week period from July to September 2005. Numerous samples were taken at the inlet and outlet of the device, and several extended tests were conducted using Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) technology to search for specific organic compounds. The results showed that the device reduced VOC, as well as odors, by approximately 85%, without the benefit of extensive fine-tuning of the device or the process during this limited run. The testing also revealed the need for extensive particulate removal at the inlet to the device, which would have a significant effect on cost efficiency.

In electrical power generation, the share of thermal plants is 64%. Because of their low capacity and high initial investment cost renewable energy sources are not preferred. Since the coal resources comprise 27% of all the energy sources, it will continue to take a role in the 21st Century. 1.75% of these resources are located in Turkey and most of the electrical power generation is based on thermal power stations. Most of the known lignite deposits in Turkey are of low calorific value, high percentage of ash, volatile matter, moisture and sulphur. Almost 75% of the total reserves are with a calorific value of below 2500 kcal/kg. 17% are between 2500 and 3000 kcal/kg. While only the 8% are over 3000 kcal/kg. Therefore, it is inevitable that the majority of such lignites which are feasible technically and economically for exploitation must be enriched by washing before marketing. Total installed capacity of based on lignite thermal power plants is 6390 MW in Turkey. In addition to 1760 MW (Can and Elbistan) is under testing. It is planned to have thermal power plants with capacities of power 13810 MW in 2010 and 16060 in 2020. Coal exploration studies will be accelerated to correspond the energy deficiency of Turkey. General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration of Turkey (MTA) will carry out a series of coal exploration projects in different regions of Turkey. As a result of these studies including drilling activities, the coal reserves will have been increased importantly. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) regulations stipulates that the green gas emissions should be dropped to 1990's level. Therefore new combustion technologies are required for energy resources. The thermal power plant in Can, Canakkale, capacity of power 2×160 MW with fluidized bed combustion technology will be a good example for the future use of this application. Turkey possesses a large lignite potential with 8.3 billion tons. New combustion technologies and coal mining applications will make this potential more attractive in the near future. The sensibility to the environmental problems in Turkey can be taken as a guarantee that we will not face the environmental problems industrialized countries had faced before.

Snow in 1959, has driven studies and reform movements within the scientific community for more than two decades. Calls to make science more relevant and to bridge barriers have been made. The study described here addresses this cultural divide in the context of drought policy. Its goal is to examine whether such a cultural divide exists and if so, what mechanisms facilitate interaction across this divide. This study was conducted between the summer of 2004 and spring of 2005. More than fifty individuals, representing both the scientific and state-level policy communities, were interviewed. Questions focused upon how scientists conducted and communicated their research, and information sources upon which policymakers draw for advice on creating state drought plans. The study used a communications model, consisting of a producer (scientists), a message, and a receptor (policy-makers). The two cultures barrier did not seem to be a significant factor in this process. While little direct communication between scientists and top policymakers was found, routine communication at lower levels of state organizations assured the effective flow of information into the policy planning process. Drought and climate information was communicated effectively to the policy community and utilized appropriately in creating or updating state-level drought plans. An additional component, intermediary organizations that help to integrate and reformat information, is included. Findings suggest that these intermediary organizations are a key component in facilitating interaction between the two communities. Scientists, intermediary organizations, and technical staff from state agencies operate together in knowledge communities, in which information is shared for development of state policy.",,"Climate information; Direct communications; Information sources; Key component; Knowledge communities; Policy community; Policy makers; Policy planning; Scientific community; Significant factors; State agencies; State policy; Technical staff; Drought; Research; Societies and institutions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949296847

The research summarized herein provides new methodologies for the characterization of engine-out speciated emissions. These analytical tools provide new insights on the mode of action and chemical forms of metal emissions arising from use of a platinum and cerium based commercial FBC, both with and without a catalyzed diesel particulate filter. Characterization efforts addressed metal solubility (water, methanol and dichloromethane) and particle size and charge of the target species in the water and solvent extracts. Platinum and cerium species were quantified using state-of-the-art high resolution plasma mass spectrometry. Liquid- chromatography-triple quad mass spectrometry techniques were developed to quantify potential parent Pt-FBC in the PM extracts. Speciation was examined for emissions from cold and warm engine cycles collected from an engine dynamometer. Water soluble platinum (6-hour extractions, 0.45 μm filtered) species represented a small fraction (2.8 ± 1.5%) of total aerosol-associated platinum. A large fraction of the water soluble platinum (44 ± 8%) was present as colloidal-sized particles. A similar fraction (54 ± 6%) of soluble cerium was retained on the ultrafilters. The fraction of platinum associated with the PM that has the potential to form truly dissolved (<10 kDa; ∼2nm) species averaged 1.5 ± 0.3%. Using ion-chromatographic methods it was determined that from 33 to 54% (41.5 ± 6.8%) of the <10 kDa -sized platinum species were anionic in character, while in contrast virtually all (97.5 ± 1.2%) of the cerium species were cationic or neutral in nature. Methanol extractions (24-hour Soxhlet, 0.45 μm filtered) released significantly more platinum (28 ± 1.4% of total) and DCM extractions significantly less platinum (0.66 ± 0.12% of total) than in water extractions. The parent Pt-FBC was not detectable in either methanol or DCM extracts of the diesel PM. The general speciation characteristics of FBC-platinum revealed in this study are consistent with findings of other studies of emissions from gasoline/diesel catalysts and those of environmental reservoirs.

However, it suffers from internal He-Ne laser disturbance in near-infrared and/or environmental background thermal emission in mid- and far-infrared spectral regions. In this work, a modulated PL technique is developed based on step-scan (SS)-FTIR spectrometer. Theoretical analysis is conducted, and applications of the technique are given as examples in the PL study of mid-infrared HgCdTe thin films and near-infrared GaInP/AlGaInP multiple quantum wells, respectively. The results indicate that the He-Ne laser and/or thermal emission disturbance can be reduced at least 1/1000 and/or even 1/10 000, respectively, by the modulated SS-FTIR PL technique, and hence a rather smooth PL spectrum can be obtained even under room temperature for HgCdTe thin films.

Most of the energy industry uses is supplied by natural gas and petroleum products, with electricity a distant third. Based on the 2002 EIA Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey, industry consumed over 5.7 quads of natural gas and over 964,000 GW-hrs (3.3 quads) of electricity. About 134,000 GW-hrs of electricity was generated on-site by industry. With the current high price of natural gas and the projected volatility in natural gas prices in years to come, industry benefits from an abundant, stable cost, reliable energy source.

Because of vehicle population growing in a tremendous speed, nearly 40% of oil has already used in transportation sector in today's China. Many kinds of alternative fuel vehicles are introduced, demonstrated and used in cities to reduce the traditional gasoline and diesel not only to reduce the regulated emissions, but also to improve the oil security of China. When the Kyoto Protocol became effective in last year, Chinese government and experts began to focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of alternative vehicle fuels. In order to comprehensively evaluating energy and Global Warming impact lead by production and utilization of Alternative vehicle fuels in China, Well-to-Wheel analysis is used in this paper to quantitatively calculate energy use and GHG emissions of recovery, production, transportation and distribution, and end-use of compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol, methanol, dimethyl ether (DME) and Fischer- Tropsch diesel (FTD). The feedstock of ethanol includes corn and wheat. The energy use and GHG emissions of alternative vehicle fuels are compared with traditional gasoline and diesel. The results show that CNG and LPG is good choice from energy saving and GHG reduction in China. NG-based and coal-based methanol, DME and F-T diesel have lower lifecycle petroleum consumption than traditional gasoline and diesel, so that they may be an answer to Chinese oil security. The lifecycle total energy use, fossil energy use and GHG emissions of NG-based synthesized fuels are lower than coal-based fuels, but obviously higher than traditional gasoline and diesel, so that utilization of them will lead to potential pressure to China GHG reduction responsibility. The GHG emissions performance of China ethanol fuel is not as good as U.S. ethanol. The main reason is abuse of agriculture chemical in corn farming, especial the nitrogenous fertilizer, which is caused great N20 emission.","Alternative vehicle fuel; Energy use; Greenhouse gases; Well-to-wheel","Computation theory; Energy utilization; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Particulate emissions; Alternative vehicle fuel; Well-to-wheel; Alternative fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43549093335

The stack gases that these CEMS have been monitoring contained sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen.

These acids combined with the (often) heated sample conditioning system components create a very corrosive atmosphere and environment. Many of these sample conditioning systems are in need of replacement to maintain the CEMS legislated performance characteristics. The modular (ANSI/ISA-76.00.02-2002) sample conditioning system performance-proven standardized concept provides a solution to replace the sampling systems which require replacement while allowing the analyzers and controllers (PC or PLC) that are currently functional to be kept intact and able to be re-connected to the modular sample conditioning system. The benefit of the modular sample conditioning system approach is the replacement sampling system can be prefabricated and will fit within the original sample system enclosure. If this original enclosure is severely corroded the modular sample conditioning system with its new enclosure will easily fit within the original confines of the existing sample system enclosure.

It is the final source category to receive technology-based regulations under the Agency's National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) program that started 16 years ago. During the past 10 years, the rule has been developed and debated, proposed and promulgated, challenged and vacated, resurrected by negotiation, re-proposed, and re-promulgated. After all this study, discussion, debate, review, and drafting, it should be authoritative and definitive. However, significant questions regarding the rule's legitimacy and legality still swirl around it. These issues arise from a steady barrage of court cases challenging many different MACT standards over the past 10 years. These cases resulted in court decisions invalidating the vast majority of the disputed rules, including the first promulgation of the HWC MACT. Due to ambiguity in the Agency's authority, the atypical nature of the hazardous waste combustor source category, and the court's difficulty understanding the Agency's complicated MACT setting process, fresh judicial challenges pose real threats to the viability of the new rules despite all of these efforts. The most troubling aspect of this curious circumstance is that any court decision regarding the newest MACT challenge may come after facilities have already upgraded units to comply with new standards, thereby forcing facilities to undertake additional upgrades in the near future.

The scenario construction for India pays specific attention to developing country dynamics, including multiple socioeconomic and demographic transitions. The article also delineates the lessons for modeling of these transitions in developing countries. The emissions pathways discussion, to begin with, considers 100-year nonintervention scenarios. For the business-as-usual scenario, the optimal portfolio of mitigation interventions in India corresponding to 550ppm (by volume) global concentration stabilization is presented.

In these amplifiers the gain saturation occurs when the optical density at the gain medium is high enough to result in depletion of the population inversion by stimulated emission. In each case, the fiber ring laser is assembled using a variable fiber coupler, a narrowband optical filter and the gain medium. For external input power values higher than the determined threshold value of the ring resonator, the gain will be saturated. Because the wavelength of the external laser is different from the oscillating wavelength of the ring resonator, the optical power at the output of the resonator is drastically decreased (low-state). On the other hand, when the input of the external laser is below the threshold value the output power of the resonator increases (high-state). In our experiment the operating wavelengths of the ring resonators are 1314 nm and 1553 nm for the SOA and EDFA respectively. The input signal is modulated around the threshold value for frequencies of 20 MHz and 1 MHz and resonator lengths of around 8 m and 16 m for the SOA and EDFA cases respectively. Both systems exhibit high contrast modulation of 41 dB and 33 dB at the output port for the low/high states of the SOA and EDFA ring lasers respectively.","EDFA; Fiber laser; Gain saturation; SOA; Wavelength conversion","EDFA; Gain saturation; Ring resonators; SOA; Wavelength conversion; Density (optical); Fiber lasers; Optical fibers; Oscillations; Resonators; Optical frequency conversion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751298285

The purpose of this paper is to describe the positive steps that were taken at URI subsequent to that grievance to improve the climate for women faculty in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields, and to place these steps within a framework for climate change. The paper starts with an overview of the percentages of women nationally in Engineering, followed by a description of the hostile grievance process that took place at URI. Next is a discussion of pro-active measures that were taken by many communities of faculty on the URI campus, including most recently, those of the ADVANCE grant funded by the National Science Foundation. These measures have been guided by a grounded theory approach to climate change that posits simultaneous change in individuals, interactional contexts, and institutional practices. As a result, URI has recruited a significant percentage of new women faculty in STEM fields in a relatively short time, and is working hard to ensure that they are retained. There have been many recent national initiatives to address the problem of the under representation of women in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines. It is well recognized that, beyond workplace equity, diversifying the practitioners in Engineering and other STEM fields will enrich these disciplines by bringing different perspectives, skills, and values to the fore, will help America remain globally competitive, and will more responsibly integrate Engineering practice with societal needs. Importantly, women and minority faculty also provide critically needed role models needed to attract and retain a more diverse student population. In Engineering, women comprise only about 20% of bachelor degree recipients, and are only 6% of full professors, 12% of associate professors, and 18% of assistant professors.[1] In addition to recruitment barriers, retention and advancement provide additional obstacles. Reduced tenure rates, slower promotion rates, inflexible and demanding work schedules that make balancing work and family difficult, heavy service and teaching loads, and a male-dominated, often hostile work climate that does not validate the needs or contributions of women participants all contribute to a higher attrition rate[2]-[5] for women than for men STEM faculty. The University of Rhode Island was representative of these trends until a series of events, culminating in the activities of the NSF ADVANCE program, provided avenues for positive change in the College of Engineering, which now serves as a model for diversity at the University. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.",,"Climate change; Curricula; Societies and institutions; Students; Grounded theory; University of Rhode Island (URI); Workplace equity; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029063574

Local authorities may feel impotent to make a significant contribution to a solution, but example is a worthwhile motive. A local authority can contribute in several ways: implementation of improved vehicle technologies; adopting road speed limits and upholding them; promotion of driving styles which are more sensitive to their environmental effects and of improved vehicle maintenance; policies to change mode of travel and transport and to reduce the amount of travel by several means, including fuller use of vehicles. Many of the ways of reducing carbon dioxide discharges locally will have other environmental benefits. The implementation of cleaner travel lags behind the science to allow it; local authorities have an important role to play in reducing the gap. Average vehicle loadings are low, especially for personal travel; there is much scope for improved environmental performance, and for public transport there are issues relating to value for public spending. Reductions in the amount of travel can also contribute to several government policies relating to social exclusion, promotion of sustainable communities and supporting town centre activities.","Environment; Transport management; Transport planning","Environmental impact; Public policy; Vehicles; Transport management; Transport planning; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; emission control; global warming; local planning; pollution policy; road transport; traffic emission; transportation planning; transportation technology; urban policy; urban pollution; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845348603

For low load conditions, the exhaust gas temperatures are less than 250°C and the PM oxidation rate due to passive regeneration is less than the PM accumulation rate. The objective of this research was to experimentally investigate active regeneration of a catalyzed particulate filter (CPF) using diesel fuel injection in the exhaust gas after the turbocharger and before a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and to collect data for extending the MTU 1-D 2-layer model to include the simulation of active regeneration. The engine used in this study was a 2002 Cummins ISM turbo charged 10.8 L heavy duty diesel engine with cooled EGR. The exhaust after-treatment system consisted of a Johnson Matthey DOC and CPF (a CCRT®). Steady-state loading experiments at 20% load at rated speed were performed for different times in order to achieve three particulate matter loadings of 1.1, 2.2 and 4.1 grams of particulate/liter of filter. Active regeneration was carried out at three CPF-inlet temperatures of 500, 550 and 600°C to cover a range of temperatures and filter loadings for thermal regeneration. The dependent data of fuel usage, time of regeneration, mass of PM oxidized and maximum substrate temperature are presented as a function of mass loading and inlet CPF temperature. The results show that higher CPF-inlet temperature and particulate matter mass loading are more effective for regeneration of the CPF and lower fuel usage in grams of PM oxidized per gallon of fuel used whereas low temperatures and lower mass loadings were not as effective due to lower reaction rates. 90% of the HC from the diesel fuel injection were oxidized across the DOC while the other 10% were oxidized across the CPF under the test conditions.

In these stands energy wood thinning directing all thinning removal to energy use can be a reasonable alternative. The annual biomass potential of energy wood thinnings in Finland is 4 million m 3, of which 3 million m 3 is stem biomass and the rest is crown biomass (incl. e.g. branches). Majority of the energy wood thinning stands are dominated by pine. Harvesting costs of energy wood thinnings are high due to the high number and small size of removed trees. Thus state subsidies play an important role in the economy of harvesting energy wood from young stands. Possibilities to include energy wood thinning for a systematic part of forest management has been studied in Finnish Forest Research Institute with the help of Motti stand simulator. Results presented in this paper concern pine dominated stands. When energy wood thinning is a systematic part of forest management, precommercial thinning is not neglected, but a denser stand is left growing. Silvicultural recommendations of today advice to leave 2000 remaining trees after precommercial thinning. In energy wood thinning alternatives 3000 or 4000 trees per hectare were left growing after precommercial thinning. In energy wood alternative thinning from below with whole tree harvesting was carried out at dominant height of 10 or 12 metres and 1300 trees per hectare were left growing. These alternatives were compared with the practice of today aiming only industrial wood production, in which thinning from below and leaving 1000 trees per hectare was carried out at the dominant height of 11-13 metres. With combined production of energy and industrial wood a remarkable amount of energy wood can be produced without compromising the industrial wood production. The first industrial wood thinning is not necessarily replaced by energy wood thinning, as is mainly the case in stands where tending practices have been neglected. However, in first industrial wood thinning the harvesting conditions, highly influencing the harvesting productivity and costs, are better in the combined production alternative. This new practice gives us possibilities to produce energy wood and promote the energy and climate strategies of the state. Also other advantages like better quality of saw timber and employment possibilities can be reached.","Energy wood thinning; Forest management; Motti stand simulator; Scots pine","Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847658798

Mercury emission in flue gases is of significant environmental concern because of its complex chemistry and extreme toxicity. The problem is particularly severe for elemental mercury (Hg°) in vapour since it cannot be effectively removed using current air pollution control devices, such as baghouses and electrostatic precipitators. Adsorption on activated carbons is an alternative solution capable of controlling gas-phase mercury emissions. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the performance of activated carbons prepared from Ptolemais lignite and demineralised lignite, as well as sulphur-impregnated activated carbons, for gas-phase mercury adsorption. For the production of activated carbons, the demineralization technique was succeeded by a two-stage activation procedure: Pyrolysis under N2 flow at 900°C, followed by activation under CO2 or CO2/N2=25/75 v/v atmosphere at the same temperature. Sulphur impregnation was realized by high purity sulphur flakes at 600°C for 2hs. Samples have been characterized for their pore structure properties by employing physical adsorption methods, such as N2 and CO2 adsorption at 77 and 298K respectively. In order to determine activated carbons surface chemistry, namely, the number and nature of oxygen groups presented in carbon matrix, basic-acid titrations based on Boehm method and TPD-MS experiments were performed. Mercury adsorption tests were realized in a bench-scale adsorption unit consisted with a fixed-bed activated carbon reactor. The main objective of this work is to identify relation between the resulted structural/chemical properties of activated carbons and the production conditions, as well as the investigation of pore structure characteristics, surface chemistry and sulphur addition impact on mercury removal. The results obtained in the previous study relatively with the preparation procedure of activated carbons from Ptolemais lignite and the textural / chemical characteristics of the resultant products have been reported. The obtained results revealed that activated carbons produced from demineralised lignite posses a high-developed micropore structure with increased total pore volume and BET surface area. These samples exhibit higher Hg° adsorptive capacity compared to the ones prepared from raw lignite. In all cases, mercury removal efficiency increased by sulphur addition due to the chemisorption mechanism. It was also found that the starting material properties and activation process affect the number and the type of the surface oxygen groups presented in the produced activated carbons. The modification of surface oxygen groups after mineral matter removal can be attributed to the release of phenols, carboxyls and lactones linked to calcium in raw lignite. Lactones and carbonyls that remain at 900°C activation temperature are considered as possible active sites that favour Hg° adsorption. In all cases, the increase of activation time resulted in smaller number of functional groups.","Activated carbon; Mercury adsorption; Oxygen groups; Pore structure","Adsorption; Coal combustion; Combustors; Mercury compounds; Pore structure; Elemental mercury; Mercury adsorption; Municipal waste combustors; Oxygen groups; Activated carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748910128

Over the years, the combustion laboratories at Laval University have completed several experimental programs to characterize the operation of a typical gas turbine combustion chamber. The flowfield around the combustor is quite complex in that it includes swirl, regions of recirculation, fuel injection, atomization, fuel evaporation, mixing, turbulent combustion, pollutants emissions, with convective and radiative heat transfer processes. The phenomenological understanding of these processes is not well established. Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), a parametric study has been undertaken to model the pollutant species and, specifically, the carbon monoxide formation and oxidation processes. As it is, CFD calculations of a large number of chemical reactions would be required to yield the correct heat release. For example, for hydrocarbon fuels, we must resolve a transport Equation for each species. The computational burden of doing so is presently unacceptable (high cost and long time for calculations) in the context of a complicated flow field and confining boundaries of the real gas turbine combustor. We are proposing in this work a hybrid procedure by which the CFD calculations are fed into semiempirical correlations to predict the emission, efficiency and temperature profile for the combustor. In fact the chemistry was uncoupled from the fluid dynamic and the analysis of Lean Blow Off (LBO) with a network of Perfectly Stirred Reactors (PSR) and Plug Flow Reactors (PFR) was addressed to respect the characteristic time modeling based on a phenomenological approach, the CFD providing local flow properties. To meet the future goals of reduced emissions produced by gas turbine combustors, a better understanding of the process of formation of various pollutants is required. Both empirical and CFD approaches are used to provide the exhaust concentrations of pollutants of interest, such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), with varying degrees of success. In the present work, a hybrid emission model simulating the combustor by a number of reactors representing various combustion zones is proposed. A LBO chemical kinetic scheme was used to provide the fundamentals to simulate the reaction progress. The model addresses the combined effects of spray evaporation and mixing in the reaction zone. The model validation included the utilization of a large data base obtained for a can combustor available at the Laval University combustion laboratory. With different operating conditions, a very good degree of agreement with the data was obtained for the temperature prediction using this hybrid model, and the trend for CO emissions was not as good at lower A/F ratio, but the prediction improved significantly at higher values (leaner conditions).",,"Carbon monoxide; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Gas turbines; Machine design; Combustion stability; Combustion zones; Hybrid modeling; Pollutant emissions; Spray evaporation; Combustors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249319838

One key issue for air quality modelling is to quantify the emission source strength variation of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) on different temporal and spatial scales. In Germany, this variation has been investigated for forests (the major source of BVOC) at country, state, and local scales over 10 years. Hourly emission rates for each vegetation period (April to October) from 1994 until 2003 were calculated in 10 km resolution. A database was compiled containing land cover, forest distribution, foliar biomass density, leaf area index (LAI) and plant specific emission potential. Meteorological input parameters were obtained using the non-hydrostatic meteorological mesoscale model MM5. The semi-empirical BVOC model (seBVOC) uses these parameters as input. SeBVOC considers in addition seasonality of the emission potentials, light extinction within the canopy as well as leaf temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and solar angle. The results show an average BVOC emission of 366 Gg, with 40 Gg isoprene, 188 Gg monoterpenes, and 138 Gg other VOC (OVOC), for the period 1994-2003. The dominating emitter type is Norway spruce (Picea abies) contributing approximately 40% to the total BVOC. In the years 1994-2003, the annual BVOC emissions varied in the range of ± 20 %. However, in specific episodes and at specific locations the variation is as high as 150% compared to average emissions. Also the BVOC composition emitted is location specific. Using a sensitivity analysis, the contribution of uncertainties in estimating foliar biomass, emission potential, as well as temperature to the overall uncertainty of calculated potential surface BVOC emission rates is addressed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

An evaluation of four gas-imaging devices was conducted at two hydrocarbon plants located in the Houston/Galveston area on 2/2-4/2004. The cameras were selected for evaluation based on their state of development and the availability of prototype or commercial camera capable of field-testing at the time of the project. The objectives of the field evaluation were to determine the mass emissions rate for various gases that each device could detect under normal refinery/chemical plant operating conditions; and to document (as appropriate) the apparent impact of external factors such as distance, angle of view, background objects, hydrocarbon type, and meteorological conditions on the ability of the gas-imaging devices to detect fugitive emissions.

The results of literature search showed anticipated sufficient improvement of the properties of cast iron by its alloying with the elements from the scarfing granulates. The novel alloying approach is based on the two stage reduction operation. Firstly the granulates were partially reduced in a solid state by their exposure with powdery carbon at the range of 1550 - 1700°C. Then the gotten product was efficiently introduced into liquid iron since it has a form of fine natural agglomerates for arranging the optimal conditions for reduction of the granulates. The thermodynamic evaluation demonstrates higher reduction efficiency of carbon and silicon dissolved in iron than of the same elements in a form of the separate phases. The considered process partially provides itself by energy since the reaction of reduction of the chromium oxide by silicon dissolved in liquid iron has exothermal character.

One system which has shown great promise in controlling PM emissions is Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). Even DPF has showed good filtering efficiency, it has also lots of challenge for serial applications. One of the challenges is regeneration of filtered PM at urban driving condition. Since the temperatures are much lower than those of PM oxidation by itself. Active systems are proposed to ensure the regeneration along variable driving conditions. In this study, Photocatalyst-Plasma and Honeycomb (PPH) is proposed as an active and continuous regeneration system of DPF on the road.

The current cooling methods can not recover the sensible heat of slag having high temperature above 1500°C. Therefore the development of new cooling process for recovering the heat as well as the value added slag will be necessary for the CO2 reduction. From these purposes, the knowledge of the TTT and the CCT diagram makes it possible to control the slag structure in the course of heat recovery. In this experiment, by using the hot thermocouple technique, the TTT and CCT diagrams were measured for clarifying the crystallization behavior. The nose position of TTT for BOF slag was less then 1s, which meant faster crystallization rate. BF slag was around 2s which located at middle between mold slag and BOF slag.

Two approaches are applied: (i) the Gibbs free energy global minimization under conditions of constant temperature and pressure and (ii) the Helmholtz free energy density global minimization under conditions of constant temperature and volume. Five case studies, one ternary and four binary systems, are analyzed in connection with the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PREOS) model. Five more case studies, for the CO2 + fra/w-2-hexen- l-ol system at high pressures, are used to compare different methods of phase equilibrium calculation with the approach using interval analysis.

These unnecessary restrictions will result in a clear loss to all parties interested in the success of these programs. The likely reason for these restrictions is a lack of knowledge of the extent to which offset sources are available and the verification rigor for which these offsets can qualify. This paper would expose the scope of our experience in identifying, creating, verifying and registering offset projects located in the United States across several industries (many of which are talked about, but rarely proven up): transportation, real estate, food and animal processing, retail distribution, enhanced oil recovery, energy conservation management, etc. Our experience in aggregating tens of millions of tonnes of various offset types over the past 5 years has given us practical knowledge that enables us to identify overlooked offsets and lower the cost of verification without lowering the project standards for such offsets. Our discussion of aggregation opportunities in light of the environmental and economic goals of these emerging trading programs should reinvigorate the discussion of the importance of offsets and clarify the rationale for expanding available sources and uses of offsets in these state and regional programs. The authors' position is based on several years of experience in sourcing and aggregating offsets in partnership with industry-leading and Fortune 500 companies.

Box 64, 00014 Helsinki, Finland","The contribution of boundary layer (BL) nucleation events to total particle concentrations on the global scale has been studied by including a new particle formation mechanism in a global aerosol microphysics model. The mechanism is based on an analysis of extensive observations of particle formation in the BL at a continental surface site. It assumes that molecular clusters form at a rate proportional to the gaseous sulfuric acid concentration to the power of 1. The formation rate of 3 nm diameter observable particles is controlled by the cluster formation rate and the existing particle surface area, which acts to scavenge condensable gases and clusters during growth. Modelled sulfuric acid vapour concentrations, particle formation rates, growth rates, coagulation loss rates, peak particle concentrations, and the daily timing of events in the global model agree well with observations made during a 22-day period of March 2003 at the SMEAR II station in Hyytiälä, Finland. The nucleation bursts produce total particle concentrations (&gt;3 nm diameter) often exceeding 104 cm-3, which are sustained for a period of several hours around local midday. The predicted global distribution of particle formation events broadly agrees with what is expected from available observations. Over relatively clean remote continental locations formation events can sustain mean total particle concentrations up to a factor of 8 greater than those resulting from anthropogenic sources of primary organic and black carbon particles. However, in polluted continental regions anthropogenic primary particles dominate particle number and formation events lead to smaller enhancements of up to a factor of 2. Our results therefore suggest that particle concentrations in remote continental regions are dominated by nucleated particles while concentrations in polluted continental regions are dominated by primary particles. The effect of BL particle formation over tropical regions and the Amazon is negligible. These first global particle formation simulations reveal some interesting sensitivities. We show, for example, that significant reductions in primary particle emissions may lead to an increase in total particle concentration because of the coupling between particle surface area and the rate of new particle formation. This result suggests that changes in emissions may have a complicated effect on global and regional aerosol properties. Overall, our results show that new particle formation is a significant component of the aerosol particle number budget.",,"aerosol composition; aerosol formation; anthropogenic source; boundary layer; concentration (composition); nucleation; regional pattern; sulfuric acid; tropical region; Amazonia; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845296333

Thus we were able to compare the exact spectral function with the self-consistent first-order Born approximation. The first observation was that the exact spectral function consists of delta functions whereas the Born approximation gives a continuous spectral function. But even after an artificially broadening of the exact spectral function, striking differences remain which are due to the inability of the Born approach to exhibit all shifts and splittings in detail. As an alternative we propose an analytic solution which employs the coherent states for representing the electron-phonon Hamiltonian. The rotating-wave approximation allows to reduce the problem to an (infinite) number of decoupled 2 × 2 matrices. Close to resonance (zero detuning), this approximation works remarkably well. The appearance of Franck-Condon factors points to the great similarity of the electron-phonon interaction in molecules and quantum dots. We have also applied the above technique to a two-band model in order to describe linear optical properties of a single quantum dot interacting with LO phonons. The exact linear polarization and the corresponding absorption spectrum is calculated by diagonalizing the appropriate Hilbert space of four electronic levels and four bosonic modes split off from the full phonon modes via an orthogonalization procedure. Parameter values for CdSe QDs are used to describe realistic absorption spectra, and a comparison between resonant and non-resonant QDs is carried out. Signatures of the phonon bottleneck are found, i.e. a stronger quasi-dephasing for the resonant case, but this is not as dramatic as simple arguments using Fermi's golden rule for phonon emission would predict. © Società Italiana di Fisica.",,"Fermi's Golden Rule; First-order Born approximation; Franck-Condon factors; Independent Boson models; Linear optical properties; Linear polarization; Rotating wave approximations; Single quantum dot; Absorption spectroscopy; Bosons; Delta functions; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Materials handling equipment; Polarons; Quantum optics; Semiconductor quantum dots; Electron-phonon interactions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884632999

Effective conversion of these microorganisms or ""waste activated sludge"" (WAS) to biogas in an anaerobic digester and converting this biogas to energy are the two most important steps that a WWTP can take to minimize its direct and indirect generation of GHGs. Maximizing biogas production can decrease a WWTP's reliance on non-renewable energy sources that generate GHGs as well as decrease the costs of purchased energy. Sludge that is not converted to biogas will lead to GHG emissions to the atmosphere. Therefore, minimizing the amount of residual sludge that must be hauled off site to be either landfilled, applied to agricultural land, or incinerated also minimizes GHG emissions. Conventional mesophilic (37°C) anaerobic digesters (CMADs) at municipal WWTPs are not efficient at converting WAS to biogas, achieving 15 to 30% volatile solids reduction of WAS in typical 15 day treatment times. They capture only a small fraction (15 to 30%) of their biogas potential, resulting in a large portion (70 to 85%) of biosolids that still require disposal. Pre-treatment of WAS is needed to improve the performance of anaerobic digestion. MicroSludge is a sludge pre-treatment technology that greatly improves the efficiency of anaerobic digestion of WAS. MicroSludge results in: (1) more recoverable energy from biogas being available and therefore less non-renewable energy required to operate a WWTP; (2) less residual solids requiring transport either to a landfill, land application site, or incinerator; and (3) fewer GHGs being generated from the fugitive emissions of less residuals. © 2006 IEEE.","Anaerobic digestion; Greenhouse gas mitigation; MicroSludge; Sludge; Wastewater treatment plants","Anaerobic digestion; Biological water treatment; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Wastewater treatment; MicroSludge; Waste activated sludge (WAS); Sewage sludge",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549140484

This paper describes an approach to develop multifunctional encapsulations. Reduction of fuel consumption - the primary goal - can be attained by extending the cool down time of the power train after engine shutoff; this will increase the probability of having a warm engine at the subsequent engine start. In addition BMW's development process enhances emission as well as exterior noise reduction and passenger thermal comfort. The fuel consumption during warm-up was analyzed and the correlation between actual customer benefit and improvements, measured according to official testing procedures, were investigated. Therefore different encapsulation concepts are presented and discussed in the context of an entire vehicle heat management concept.

In addition to accessing the impacts on mean and turbulent flow, sediment transport, and aquatic habitat of clusters, there is need for a basic understanding of the hydraulic, sedimentary, and geomorphic properties prompting existence of clustered topography. With such knowledge we might be able to predict the onset of clusters in stream reaches and therefore watersheds. The present research aims at addressing this shortcoming through a field study on a mountain stream. Traditional geomorphic characterization of clusters and the site at which they were located was conducted. Five main types of clusters with differing visual and quantitative characteristics were identified; namely the comet, heap, line, pebble, and ring shaped clusters. Additionally, hydraulic characterization of a cluster at the study site was conducted using a 3D acoustic Doppler velocimeter to identify particular fluid signatures left by clusters. The investigation is then integrated with existing data in the literature to present a combined dataset of river slope and sediment d 84 where clusters have been recorded. Results show that clusters have been found in a wide range of slopes and particles sizes (0.004≤S ≤0.06 and in 50≤d 84 ≤500 mm), but are most likely to occur in cobble size sediment at slopes typical of riffle-pool to plane bed morphologies. We hypothesize that although cluster microform dynamics are an outcome of local sediment and fluid conditions, these local dynamics are in turn a function of the larger-scale watershed dynamics; as watershed and climate properties govern topography, sediment input, and hydrology of a local stream reach. Implications of these results and hypothesis suggest that given the proper input from remote sensing satellite data, we will be able to predict, in an average sense, where cluster bedforms will develop in a stream corridor/watershed. © 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis Group.",,"Acoustic Doppler velocimeter; Aquatic habitats; Bedforms; Climate properties; Data sets; Distribution of cluster; Field studies; Flow characteristic; Fluid conditions; Hydraulic characterization; Hydraulic methods; Laboratory experiments; Local dynamics; Mountain rivers; Mountain streams; Particle clusters; Particles sizes; Plane bed; Quantitative characteristics; Remote sensing satellites; Stream corridors; Study sites; Anoxic sediments; Dynamics; Estuaries; Forecasting; Microforms; Rivers; Sediment transport; Sedimentology; Stream flow; Watersheds; Landforms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857027298

Pythium root rot continually threatens the productivity of numerous kinds of crops in hydroponic systems around the world including cucumber, tomato, sweet pepper, spinach, lettuce, nasturtium, arugula, rose, and chrysanthemum. Principal causal agents include Pythium aphanidermatum, Pythium dissotocum, members of Pythium group F, and Pythium ultimum var. ultimum. Perspectives are given of sources of initial inoculum of Pythium spp. in hydroponic systems, of infection and colonization of roots by the pathogens, symptom development and inoculum production in host roots, and inoculum dispersal in nutrient solutions. Recent findings that a specific elicitor produced by P. aphanidermatum may trigger necrosis (browning) of the roots and the transition from biotrophic to necrotrophic infection are considered. Effects on root rot epidemics of host factors (disease susceptibility, phenological growth stage, root exudates and phenolic substances), the root environment (rooting media, concentrations of dissolved oxygen and phenolic substances in the nutrient solution, microbial communities and temperature) and human interferences (cropping practices and control measures) are reviewed. Recent findings on predisposition of roots to Pythium attack by environmental stress factors are highlighted. The commonly minor impact on epidemics of measures to disinfest nutrient solution as it recirculates outside the crop is contrasted with the impact of treatments that suppress Pythium in the roots and root zone of the crop. New discoveries that infection of roots by P. aphanidermatum markedly slows the increase in leaf area and whole-plant carbon gain without significant effect on the efficiency of photosynthesis per unit area of leaf are noted. The platform of knowledge and understanding of the etiology and epidemiology of root rot, and its effects on the physiology of the whole plant, are discussed in relation to new research directions and development of better practices to manage the disease in hydroponic crops. Focus is on methods and technologies for tracking Pythium and root rot, and on developing, integrating, and optimizing treatments to suppress the pathogen in the root zone and progress of root rot. © 2006, Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP).

We have broadened the extended adsorption theory due to Kvamme and Tanaka (J. Phys. Chem., 1995, 99, 7114) through derivation of the free energy density surface in case of CO2 and CH4 hydrates. A combined free energy surface for the liquid phases has been obtained from a SRK equation of state and solubility measurements outside hydrate stability. The full thermodynamic model is shown to predict water-hydrate equilibrium properties in agreement with experiments. Molecular dynamics simulations of hydrates in contact with water at 200 bar and various temperatures allowed us to estimate hard-to-establish properties needed as input parameters for the practical applications of proposed theories. The 5-95 confidence interval for the interface thickness for the methane hydrate/liquid water is estimated to 8.54 Å. With the additional information on the interface free energy, the phase field theory will contain no adjustable parameters. We provide a demonstration of how this theory can be applied to model the kinetics of hydrate phase transitions. The growth of hydrate from aqueous solution was found to be rate limited by mass transport, with the concentration of solute close to the hydrate approaching the value characterizing the equilibrium between the hydrate and the aqueous solution. The depth of the interface was estimated by means of the phase field analysis; its value is close to the interface thickness yielded by molecular simulations. The variation range of the concentration field was estimated to approximately 1/3 of the range of the phase field. © the Owner Societies 2006.",,"carbon dioxide; methane; water; article; kinetics; theoretical model; thermodynamics; Carbon Dioxide; Kinetics; Methane; Models, Theoretical; Thermodynamics; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645471190

LNTs are practical for diesel NOx reduction due to their ability to reduce NOx from the O2 rich environment produced by diesel engines. LNTs function by storing NO x on the catalyst surface during efficient lean operation then, under rich conditions, releasing and reducing the trapped NOx. One method of producing this rich environment which regenerates a LNT involves manipulating the fuel injection parameters and throttling the air intake. This process is called in-cylinder regeneration. Experiments will be described here in which a 1.7 L common rail diesel engine has been used to regenerate LNTs at various stages of sulfur exposure, a known poison of the LNT. In-cylinder regeneration strategies were used to produce a range of reductant chemistries which enabled the study of the role of various reductants as NOx was converted across the LNT. This study gives insight into how to most efficiently regenerate the LNT. Sulfur poisoning of a fresh LNT was accelerated via the use of bottled SO2. Regeneration studies at various states of sulfation and after catalyst desulfation are discussed, highlighting intra-catalyst measurements of reductant chemistry and NOx conversion through the catalyst. Results showed that as sulfur loading increased, NOx conversion efficiency decreased and reductant utilization shifted downstream. Hydrogen from in-cylinder combustion was consumed over the first half of the LNT then produced from other available reductants over the last half for some strategies and conditions. Hydrogen production over the last portion of the catalyst was found to be affected by sulfur.

A research to measure the fugitive emissions from pipeline and equipment leaks in the petrochemical industry and the development of the techniques to control those fugitive emissions are presented. A research that analyzed 11.5 million leak-rate measurements is described and demonstrated that over 90% of the emissions emanate from only a few of the high-rate leakers and that those high-rate leakers are not chronic but occurs randomly from time to time throughout the plant. This finding led to the need for a method of searching for the high-rate leakers and repairing those leaks more frequently to reduce the period of leakage and thus the overall emissions. This concept was termed ""Smart LDAR"". As LDAR programs are currently conducted, nearly 1000 components are screening for every large leaker discovered. If a remote sensing instrument were used that could detect the high leakers and the frequency of detection could be reduced from the current quarter-annual period, the period of release would be reduced and a significant reduction in emissions would be made.

Also, we assess future perspectives for the hydrogen economy in such a scenario. The results show that as major petroleum and gas supplies shift to unconventional resources along the second half of this century due to resource depletion, the Middle East loses its importance as a petroleum and gas exporter and the global patterns of their transportation change significantly. We then show that while hydrogen’s competitiveness decreases due to the detailed treatment of energy and CO2 transportation, biomass-derived Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuels become attractive because their production facilitates a wide diffusion of CO2-neutral energy carriers by considerably reducing the transportation cost. FT fuels are produced in regions rich in forest resources and then transported on a large scale by tanker. By contrast, hydrogen is produced mainly at the center of its consumption regions using domestic feedstock, and its interregional delivery, which is done only by pipeline, plays a marginal role due to its high transportation cost. It is confirmed that such a hydrogen supply structure offers energy security benefits. Finally, we show that the regional distribution of CO2 storage capacity is a major determinant of the pattern of hydrogen transportation around 2100, because all the CO2 generated from hydrogen production is required to be captured for sequestration in that period and because interregional CO2 transportation is hardly chosen for economic reasons. © 2006, Springer Japan.","CO2 concentration stabilization; Fischer-Tropsch synthetic fuels; Hydrogen; Interregional energy transportation; Regionally disaggregated global energy model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46049120923

The results show that even in the CO2-constrained world, coal can remain one of the important primary energy sources throughout the century on the condition that the resulting CO2 is properly captured and sequestered. Coal’s competitiveness in such a world would increase with the introduction of CCS, but decrease with the leak rate for CO2 stored underground. For the optimal coal use, a common trend toward producing convenient and clean final energy carriers via gasification is observed. Under the CO2 constraint, coal is increasingly converted via gasification with CCS into electricity and hydrogen, thereby providing CO2-neutral energy carriers and facilitating CO2 capture, which helps China and India develop in a sustainable manner. These findings prove to be robust with respect to the costs of gasification-based conversion technologies and CCS. It is suggested that the establishment of reliable CCS technologies and low-cost gasification-based conversion technologies and their transfer to developing regions would raise the value of coal and provide energy security benefits under the CO2 constraint. However, it is also indicated that large-scale introduction of coal with CCS into leaky reservoirs would cause large CO2 emissions from leaks over the very long term. © 2006, Springer Japan.","Carbon capture and sequestration; Coal gasification; Global energy model analysis; Leakage of sequestered CO2; Synthetic fuel production",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46049084514

However, global objectives may contradict individual benefits; attempts to reduce CO2 emissions can result in the commons dilemma. This paper explores how the cooperation of individual households can be invoked to achieve a global target of reducing CO2 emissions from households (HACO2) in cities. A commons payoff function linked household benefits to the number of cooperators in a city: a CO2 emission trading scheme (CETS) for households was introduced into the payoff function as a way to support cooperators. A multi-agent simulator was applied to a search for relationships among parameters in the payoff function and social cooperation from households (R). Results indicate that levying only household maintenance charges is an ineffective way to gain the cooperation of more than half of the households in a city, and extremely high maintenance also discouraged cooperative behavior; the use of CETS could increase cooperation, and R &gt; 0.6 when emission trading prices were five times higher than unit reduction costs, and when unit maintenance charges were almost the same as reduction costs; and it was impossible to gain cooperation from all households until opinions about resource use and reducing emissions were changed. © 2006, Architectural Institute of Japan.

SABER measures earthlimb emissions and characterizes infrared radiation, allowing calculation of atmospheric temperature and composition (ozone, water vapor, and carbon dioxide), as well as solar and chemical heating rates and infrared cooling rates. Although SABER focuses on the unexplored 60-180km region, it makes measurements covering the 10-350km altitude region. Ground calibration testing was completed in September 1999. Subsequent data analyses and report generation were completed in June, 2000. This paper provides a brief overview of instrument design, calibration planning, ground calibration testing, and results.

These materials are attractive both from an agricultural and governmental perspective because they are renewable and biodegradable. In addition, they have great potential economic impact for farming communities around the world. Compared to products in which petroleum-based resins are used, these materials also reduce volatile emissions. Increased research and development in this area is needed as there is current U.S. government preferential procurement status for biobased materials, increasingly tighter restrictions on using synthetic materials, and continuous development of sustainable materials as alternatives to petroleum based materials. Three types of composite materials were processed and compared in this study; one from blends of soybean oil-based epoxy with synthetic epoxy resin and E-glass fiber, another one from blends of epoxidized methyl ester derived from canola oil with synthetic epoxy resin and E-glass fiber, and the third from 100% synthetic epoxy resin and E-glass fiber. Composite panel properties were evaluated using low velocity impact (LVI) and flexural testing. Composite panels consisting of blended soybean oil-based epoxy with synthetic epoxy resin and E-glass fiber were shown to have a comparable dynamic stiffness, flexural modulus, and flexural stiffness. However, the results for the other biobased samples were not as promising.","Environmental/pollution prevention; Materials - Soy-based; Toughened composites","Flexural testing; Low velocity impact (LVI); Toughened composites; Biodegradability; Composite materials; Synthesis (chemical); Vegetable oils; Glass",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858477924

While in Europe the overall diesel share exceeds 40%, the current diesel share in the United States is 1%. Despite the current situation and the very stringent Tier 2 emission standards, efforts are being made to introduce the diesel engine back into the U.S. market. In order to succeed, these vehicles have to comply with emissions standards over a 120,000 miles distance while maintaining their excellent fuel economy. The availability of technologies-such as high-pressure, common-rail fuel systems; low-sulfur diesel fuel; oxides of nitrogen (NOx) adsorber catalysts or NACs; and diesel particle filters (DPFs)-allow the development of powertrain systems that have the potential to comply with the light-duty Tier 2 emission requirements. In support of this, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) teamed with industry to engage in several testing projects under the Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels - Diesel Emission Controls (APBF-DEC) activity [1; 2; 5; 6; 7; 8]. Three of the APBF-DEC projects evaluated the sulfur tolerance and durability of NAC/DPF systems on various platforms, and one evaluated the performance and durability of a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system in heavy-duty engines. A fifth project investigated the effects of oil properties on the performance and durability of a NAC. This project investigated the performance of the emission control system and system desulfurization effects on regulated and unregulated emissions in a light-duty diesel engine. Emissions measurements were conducted over the Federal Test Procedure (FTP), the US06 [an aggressive chassis dynamometer emissions test procedure, part of the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP)], and the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET). Testing was conducted after the accumulation of 150 hours of engine operation calculated to be the equivalent of approximately 8,200 miles. For these evaluations, three out of six of the FTP test cycles were within the 50,000-mile Tier 2 bin 5 emission standards [0.05 g/mi NOx and 0.01 g/mi particulate matter (PM)]. Emissions over the SC03 (airconditioning test) portion of the SFTP were within limits of the 4,000-mile SFTP standards. Emissions of NOx+NMHC (non-methane hydrocarbons) exceeded the 4,000-mile SFTP standards over the US06 portion of the SFTP. Testing was also conducted after the accumulation of 1,000 hours of engine operation calculated to be the equivalent of approximately 50,000 miles. The results were reported in [7] 2005-01-1755. Recalibrated drivability maps resulted in more repeatable NOx emissions from cycle to cycle. The NOx level was below the Tier 2 emission limits for 50,000 and 120,000 miles. NMHC emissions were found at a level outside the limit for 120,000 miles.

This paper examines local and international initiatives within the Canadian stakeholder community (including government, NGOs, consultants, industry) that contribute to the initiation and implementation of cleaner production in industry. Specifically, stakeholders have consciously drafted regulatory compliance, education, co-funding incentives, and development-based cleaner production programs. As illustrated by case studies from six industries, the programs work together to create a climate favorable for implementation of cleaner production concepts and approaches. Based on the cleaner production drivers and barriers identified by research, the programs are well designed. However, as with cleaner production itself, there is always room for further improvement. Specifically: (i) regulatory compliance programs and timetables should leave room for cleaner production (versus end-of-pipe) approaches; (ii) cleaner production co-funding programs should target small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and require them to use a multimedia approach (air, water, waste); (iii) education programs should incorporate demonstration assessments, feasibility assessments of common recommendations, and follow-up communication to foster implementation and continuous improvement; and (iv) mandated cleaner production should include absolute (i.e. waste/tonne production) rather than relative standards (i.e. X% reduction from status quo) in order to avoid penalizing historically proactive corporations. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparative monitoring of surface internal temperature of roof tiles, simultaneously with and without water spraying at different time intervals, as well as attic air temperatures of corresponding cell-tests are presented. The technique allowed verifying a significant difference in the tile surface internal temperature, even when water spraying occurred in small time intervals. Results show that evaporative cooling in fiber-cement tiles for heat attenuation with reduced time intervals of water spraying, even in season with high relative humidity could be a passive cooling technique for low-income housing, for which those tiles are frequently the only roof component.","Evaporative cooling; Roofing; Spray cooling; Thermal behavior","Air temperature; Evaporative cooling; Fiber cements; High relative humidities; Indoor temperature; Internal temperature; Low-income housing; Passive cooling techniques; Roof tiles; Roofing; Spray cooling; Thermal behaviors; Time interval; Tropical climates; Water spraying; Atmospheric temperature; Evaporation; Evaporative cooling systems; Research; Roofs; Building materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865790882

DG technologies are commonly found in urban areas that are sensitive to criteria pollutants, and as a result, they are subject to increasingly stringent emission regulations. Paralleling the growth of installed DG is the ever-increasing interest in hydrogen as an alternative fuel to natural gas. As a hydrogen infrastructure is developed, a desire to use this new fuel for DG applications will evolve. Microturbine generators (MTGs) are one example of DG technology that has emerged in this paradigm and are the technology of interest in the present work. To evaluate the potential role for hydrogen fired MTGs in this paradigm, understanding of what emission levels can be expected from such a system is needed The current study retrofits a natural gas fired MTG for operation on hydrogen and characterizes the resulting operability and emissions performance. The results of implementing design changes to improve emissions performance while maintaining stability and safety of the MTG when operating on hydrogen fuel are presented. The results also show improved stability limits which are utilized to help attain lower emissions of NOx. Further optimization is needed to achieve the NOx levels necessary to meet current regulations.

CERES instrument has three scanning thermistor bolometers that measure broadband radiances in the shortwave (0.3 to 5.0 micrometer), total (0.3 to >100 micrometer) and 8-12 micrometer water vapor window regions. Four CERES instruments (Flight Models 1 through 4) are flying aboard EOS Terra and Aqua platforms with two instruments aboard each spacecraft. The pre-launch accuracy requirements for CERES were 1.0% in the shortwave and 0.5% in longwave regions. The in-flight calibration of CERES sensors are carried out using the internal calibration module (ICM) comprising of blackbody sources and tungsten lamp, and a solar diffuser plate known as the Mirror Attenuator Mosaic (MAM). The ICM and MAM calibration results are instrumental in understanding the ground to flight shift and in-flight drifts in CERES sensors' gains. Inter and intra instrument validation studies are conducted on the CERES measurements to monitor the behavior of the sensors in various spectral regions. Targets such as deep convective clouds and tropical ocean are used to evaluate the sensors' stability within an instrument. With two CERES instruments on same platform, inter comparison of similar sensor measurements viewing the same geolocation are also conducted. The results from these individual studies have collectively given an understanding of each CERES sensor's behavior in different spectral regions.

As a response to the EPAs call for states to develop a SIP for the 1-hr ozone standard, the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality proposed a HRVOC Emissions Cap and Trade Program (HECT). The program will set an area-wide cap on HRVOC emissions from industrial point sources, including refineries, olefins manufacturing facilities, and polymer manufacturing facilities. Eight-hour ozone attainment was demonstrated using relative reduction factors (RRF). To study the effect of the HECT, on 8-hr ozone averages, RRF were calculated for extreme cases of HRVOC trading (all allocations end up in one area).

So the question Is, how will the accelerated receipt of cleaner energy technologies be successfully achieved In marginalised communities In developing countries? The paper considers a range of drivers, case studies and projects, that are being undertaken as early Clean Development Mechanism experiments under the banner of the International SouthSouthNorth Group. It discusses the drivers of technology transfer and starts to unpack the elements of successful ownership of the technologies. The paper considers ownership of hardware, software (process) and orgware (Institutions) required to advance the diffusion and use of Environmentally Safe Technologies (ESTs) for the provision of energy services. It presents an approach to project selection and development under SouthSouthNorth which attempts to secure successful ownership and receipt of classes of technology that provide services essential for development. © 2006 IEEE.","Clean development mechanism (CDM); Environmentally safe technologies (ESTs); Technology transfer and reception","Climate change; Computer software; Developing countries; Greenhouse gases; Innovation; Project management; Clean development mechanism (CDM); Clean energy technology; Environmentally safe technologies (EST); Intervention; Technology transfer",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549147236

The use of endogeneous fluorescence markers like porphyrins could simplify the application of fluorescence techniques in the dental practice. It is known that porphyrins are produced by some of the bacterial species that are present in the oral cavity. Since porphyrins have an excitation band at about 400nm they have the potential to be used as fluorescent markers of locations in the oral cavity where the production of bacteria is out of the limits of healthy regions. Further, modern and efficient GaN-based semiconductor diodes emit light in this spectral range and thus make the implementation of fluorescence sensors with excitation at this wavelength easy. Carious lesions, calculus and plaque have been measured using a self build fluorescence camera using GaN-diodes for illumination at 405nm. Further, emission spectra under this excitation were recorded. For the latter purpose freshly extracted teeth were used. It has been found that already in the case of an initial carious lesion red porphyrin-fluorescence is emitted whereas it is absent in healthy enamel. In already brown coloured carious lesions the emission bands of porphyrin are present but the observed overall fluorescence intensity is lower, probably due to the absorption of the fluorescence by the carious defect itself. In dental calculus, dental plaque and subgingival concrements porphyrin originated luminescence was found as well. Since in these cases the emission spectra differ slightly it can be concluded that they originate from different types of porphyrins and thus also from different bacteria. These results show that this fluorescence technique can be a promising method to diagnose carious lesions, calculus and plaque.","Bacteria; Calculus; Camera; Caries; Emission spectrum; Fluorescence; Imaging; Plaque; Porphyrin","Calculus; Caries; Emission spectrum; Plaque; Porphyrin; Aromatic compounds; Bacteria; Biomarkers; Cameras; Fluorescence; Medical imaging; Medical problems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745383920

One of the obstacles to the increased use of diesel engines in this platform is the Tier 2 emission standards. In order to succeed, diesel vehicles must comply with emissions standards while maintaining their excellent fuel economy. The availability of technologies-such as common rail fuel injection systems, low-sulfur diesel fuel, oxides of nitrogen (NOX) adsorber catalysts or NACs, and diesel particle filters (DPFs)-allows for the development of powertrain systems that have the potential to comply with these future requirements. In support of this, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has engaged in several test projects under the Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels-Diesel Emission Control (APBF-DEC) activity [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Three of the APBF-DEC projects evaluated the sulfur tolerance of a NAC/DPF system and the full useful life implications of NAC desulferization. The test bed for one project in this activity is a 2500 series Chevrolet Silverado equipped with a 6.6L Duramax diesel engine certified to 2002 model year (MY) federal heavy-duty and 2002 MY California medium-duty emission standards. While NAC systems have demonstrated extremely high levels of NOX reduction in steady-state laboratory evaluations, the application of a NAC system to an actual transient engine has not been demonstrated. Such an application requires the development of an integrated engine/emissions management system [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Two previous papers detailed the thermal and NOX adsorber management aspects of a system applied to the project test bed [1, 2]. The final control strategies applied to this project achieved over 98% reductions in tailpipe NOX mass emission over the hot-start Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS). This paper discusses the emission results of the system measured over the course of 2000 hours of on-engine aging exposure. The system was evaluated over the cold-start UDDS, hot-start UDDS, Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET) and US06 portion of the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP). The discussion will cover the aging cycle utilized and its development, details of the desulfurization process, and regulated emission results over the test cycles of interest. After 2000 hours of on-engine aging, the NAC/DPF system demonstrated an average NOX reduction of 89% and PM reduction of 94% over the composite Federal Test Procedure (FTP).

In some regions, it is as hard to site a wind farm as it is to permit a gas-fired power plant, or a conventional coal plant, or an LNG facility to provide fuel for local power generation. New power lines are as difficult to site today as they ever have been. The prospect of siting advanced coal or advanced nuclear projects - should they be economic in the future - poses almost staggering siting challenges. And yet, many regions need new infrastructure in order to affordably and reliably meet the growing energy needs of consumers in a manner that also protects the environment and enhances our national security. And nationally - moreover, globally - we must address the challenge of reducing the electric sector's greenhouse gas emissions profile. Siting difficulties stem from tension between an increasing unwillingness to accept the construction of energy infrastructure in local communities, and the need to add critical energy infrastructure. While large infrastructure projects can impose significant changes on neighborhoods, and these local impacts must be comprehensively reviewed and addressed, the importance of energy infrastructure must also be accurately assessed. Dr. Susan Tierney, Managing Principal of Analysis Group Inc., will examine energy facility siting, and the policy reforms, project development attributes and siting processes that increase the odds of success. Using examples from wind projects, power plants, and fuel supply facilities, and drawing from her two decades of experience in state and federal environmental and energy regulation, in consulting to energy projects, and in serving as an expert on these topics, Dr. Tierney will identify best practices that assure the siting of critical energy infrastructure consistent with addressing regional and global environmental challenges.",,"Critical energy; Electric infrastructure; Energy regulation; Gas-fired power plants; Coal; Customer satisfaction; Electric equipment; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Gas fuels; Greenhouse effect; Laws and legislation; Liquefied natural gas; Electric power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846229673

Installation of after-treatment devices such as diesel particulate filters (DPF), NOx storage reduction (NSR) catalysts, and so on is indispensable to satisfy rigorous limits of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Japan Clean Air Program II Oil Working Group (JCAPII Oil WG) has been investigating the effect of engine oil on advanced diesel after-treatment devices. First of all, we researched the impact of oil-derived ash on continuous regeneration-type diesel particulate filter (CR-DPF), and already reported that the less sulfated ash in oil gave rise to lower pressure drop across CR-DPF [1]. In this paper, impact of oil-derived sulfur and phosphorus on NSR catalyst was investigated using a 4L direct injection common-rail diesel engine with turbo-intercooler. This engine equipped with NSR catalyst meets the Japanese new short-term emission regulations. The test was carried out through the steady state operating condition at medium load and speed. In order to accelerate the influence of sulfur, S purge is cancelled, which is fuel injection control for the recovery from sulfur poisoning. During test duration of 200 hours, NOx conversion ratio of the catalyst was deteriorated mainly by sulfur poisoning from both fuel and oil. On the other hands, catalyst analysis revealed that phosphorus was much less than sulfur on the catalyst surface, resulting that the catalyst degradation by oil-derived phosphorus wasn't recognized.

In terms of piston ring pack, the trend is to reduce ring tangential load and width. On the other hand, the main concern is to have proper ring conformability and lube oil control. This work presents the comparison of a baseline ring pack with a low friction pack in terms of friction, blow-by control and lube oil consumption. Besides ring width and tangential load reductions, evaluations of ring materials are also carried out. Narrow compression rings, 1.0 and 0.8 mm, were engine tested. PVD top ring was also tested and showed about 10% friction reduction compared to the usual Gas Nitrided one. 3-piece 1.5 mm oil rings were compared with the usual 2.0 mm ones. Being more flexible, the narrower oil rings can have same conformability with reduced tangential load. Friction was measured in the mono-cylinder SI Floating Liner engine at 5 operational conditions. Effect of cylinder roughness on friction is discussed by reciprocating bench tests. Compared with a typical 1.2/1.2/2.0 mm SI ring pack, the proposed 1.0/1.0/1.5 mm pack brought about 28% reduction in ring friction in the tested conditions, which would mean in about 1% of fuel savings in urban use.

However, due to the continuous scaling of features size and supply voltage, spontaneous emission is becoming fainter and optical circuit diagnostics becomes more challenging. Here we present the experimental characterization of hot-carrier luminescence emitted by transistors in four CMOS technologies from two different manufacturers. Aim of the research is to gain a better perspective on emission trends and dependences on technological parameters. In particular, we identify luminescence changes due to Short-Channel Effects (SCE) and we ascertain that, for each technology node, there are two operating regions, for short- and long-channels. We highlight the emission reduction of p-FETs compared to n-FETs, due to a ""red-shift"" (lower energy) of the hot-carrier distribution. Eventually, we give perspectives about emission trends in actual and future technology nodes, showing that luminescence dramatically decreases with voltage, but it recovers strength when moving from older to more advanced technology generations.

ARC has been in use in the US since the mid 1980's and has proven to be an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional asphalt pavement. ARC has many reported benefits that distinguish it from conventional asphalt pavements. Among them are longer service life, reduced reflective cracking, reduced rutting, and reduced road noise. Although the primary goal of the trial project was to establish whether ARC was a viable alternative road surfacing material in Alberta's climate, reduced road noise has proven to be a significant side benefit. In Alberta, several roadways have been paved with ARC since 2002 in both urban and rural areas. In conjunction with the ARC paving, road noise was measured at selected project locations both prior to and after paving with ARC and then on an annual basis through 2005. In this paper, the theory of noise propagation and methodology of measuring the road noise will be presented and, using the urban and rural area road noise data acquired over the last four years, a comparison between the road noise associated with ARC and previously existing conventional pavements will be discussed. The mechanism that results in lower road noise will be addressed as part of this discussion. In addition, the ramifications of quieter roads will be examined by addressing the cost of quieter ARC pavements compared to conventional pavements and the cost of other noise mitigation measures compared to ARC.",,"Asphalt; Asphalt pavements; Roads and streets; Rubber; Rural areas; Environmentally friendly alternatives; Noise mitigation; Noise propagation; Recycling management; Reflective cracking; Surfacing materials; Transportation agencies; Urban and rural areas; Transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898445860

In this context, numerical simulators are the practical tools to understand the physical processes involved by acid gas injection and evaluate the long term stability of the storage. CO2 storage models can be seen as a mix between two types of models: a reservoir model coupling multiphase flow in porous media with local phase equilibria and an hydrogeochemical model coupling transport in aqueous phase with local chemical equilibria and kinetic reaction laws. In a recent paper, Nghiem et al. [1] proposed a fully-coupled method to solve this problem extending the local PVT-unknowns elimination strategy to geochemical problems. This paper presents a different approach which combine the two models in a single computation using a sequential splitting method. The main advantage of this approach is the ability to choose a specific numerical scheme for each model. From a mathematical point of view, this method can be seen as a two stage time integration scheme. At each stage we compute an approximate solution of the main problem using some predicted terms estimated from previous stages. This scheme is a sequential splitting strategy so it may induce some numerical errors relevant for the physical coherence of the model. To correct this error without using any iterative method, we propose to use a correction stage. This method has been implemented in a research computer code. The code is applied to model a field-scale CO2 storage in an heterogeneous saline aquifer.",,"Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Petroleum reservoirs; Porous materials; Approximate solution; Chemical equilibriums; Hydrogeochemical model; Multiphase flow in porous medias; Numerical simulators; Research and development; Sequential splitting; Time-integration scheme; Problem solving",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896268797

The EPA estimates that the number of premature deaths could be reduced by 15,000 by reducing the amount of PM2.5 particulate in the atmosphere.1 The Indigo Agglomerator has been installed at six power stations worldwide, providing a significant improvement in electrostatic precipitator performance that has proven consistent over time and a wide range of coals. The six power stations utilize a range of plant designs including European and American design electrostatic precipitators and various boiler combustion arrangements. The coals burned include a range of Australian, Columbian, and United States coals. This paper reports the results of tests carried out at two Southern Company and two other US utility coal fired power stations assessing the reduction of PM2.5 emissions with the Indigo Agglomerator installed ahead of existing electrostatic precipitators (ESPs). The Indigo Agglomerator uses a combination of electrostatic forces and fluidic mixing to attach the PM2.5 particulate to the coarser particulate, which is more easily collected by ESPs. Reductions of 50-70% of the 1.0 to 2.5 micron particles and reductions of greater than 90% of the 0.1 micron particles are reported in this paper.

For the internal combustion engine, the most promising of these include gasoline direct injection, downsizing and fully variable valve trains. While new types of spray-guided gasoline direct injection (GDI) combustion systems are finally set to yield the level of fuel consumption improvement which was originally promised for the so-called 'first generation' wall- and air-guided types of GDI, injectors for spray-guided combustion systems are not yet in production to help justify the added complication and cost of the NOx trap necessary with a stratified combustion concept. Conversely, hardware suitable for homogeneous combustion systems is available now and this approach offers the advantage that simple three-way catalysis only needs to be used for exhaust gas aftertreatment. This in turn means that homogeneous GDI is a technology applicable to a world-wide market, because NOx traps are susceptible to poisoning by sulphur, such as is to be found in high concentrations in US gasolines. Advanced mechanically-variable valve trains are in production now, which considerably reduce pumping losses in the 4-stroke engine over the conventional 'variable density' type of throttling. Fully variable valve trains are being developed to production, too. These technologies allow throttling loss to be addressed directly rather than by the more circuitous route of stratified charge combustion. While homogeneous combustion systems with load control by valve event may not offer the ultimate thermodynamic benefits of stratified charge, the fuel consumption improvement possibilities are still considerable, relative to a state-of-the-art port fuel injection engine. The present work discusses the start of the HOTFIRE consortium project which is a three-year programme to investigate the strong interactions and synergies between homogeneous GDI and fully variable valve train systems. Initial results from the consortium's high-speed optical access engine, fitted with a research fully variable valve train system, are presented. Work responsibilities within the project are discussed together with the potential of the assembled test equipment to look at the interaction between variable valve trains and spray-guided GDI systems in the future.

Energy system is essential not only for our production and consumption but also for recycling materials. Therefore, restructuring it is one of the key issues to create a sustainable environment. We aimed to evaluate a policy introducing the tax on emission of greenhouse gas (GHG) and the subsidy for industries producing energy from wastes. Burnable wastes consist mainly of carbon-neutral biomass, but methane gas is emitted in the air from wastes left out in the open, which has 21 times as high greenhouse effect as carbon dioxide. Adequate treatment of waste is expected to reduce the emission of methane, and contribute to many other effects such as saving energy resources, material recycle and the creation of employment. A socioeconomic model simulation was examined as prior evaluation of policy measures. The model is based on I/O model and considered the flow of wastes and energy, and new industries which produce energy from wastes and the economic policies of the tax and the subsidy were introduced in the model. On the restriction of total emission of GHG, GDP was maximized as objective function. The effect of the policies on reducing GHG emission and promoting new industries are examined and the optimum tax rate is considered. © 2006, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

This predisposes the premixed inlet vortex flow to transition to a vortex breakdown state, which is characterized by low deceleration, stagnation and recirculation zones near the dump plane. This creates a compact turbulent and highly mixed reaction zone, which enables the use of leaner combustion to reduce emissions drastically. However, when the swirl level is too low, the flame cannot be stabilized and blows out. On the other hand, when swirl is too high, flashback may occur i.e. the flame may move upstream into the injection region. This work describes numerical simulations of non-reacting and combusting flows, which provide insight into the characteristics of the axisymmetric vortex breakdown phenomenon in a circular finite-length pipe with an expansion downstream of a circular inlet pipe. Results show that inert and combusting states with vortex breakdown can be simulated numerically. Good agreement is found between the results of the simulations and available theoretical predictions for the first appearance of breakdown downstream of the pipe expansion plane as well as its first appearance in the inlet pipe section as upstream swirl level is increased. It is demonstrated that the theoretical criteria can be used to predict the occurrence of flame blow out and flashback. The effects of inlet flow temperature, Mach number and global pressure on the velocity, temperature and reactant fields within the domain are also investigated.",,"Premixed combustors; Recirculation zones; Vortex breakdown; Combustors; Computer simulation; Intake systems; Turbulence; Vortex flow; Swirling flow",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845274735

The enforcement of air quality standards, which regulate pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and arsenic, has resulted in the implementation of pollution abatement plans and emission reduction schedules mainly by state-owned copper concentrate smelters. Investments associated with these plans incorporated gas-handling systems in order to capture polluting emissions. Electrostatic precipitators recover dusts containing mainly Cu and As which are leached to recover copper, while arsenic is disposed currently in the form of ferric arsenate. Gases containing high sulfur dioxide content are treated in plants to produce sulfuric acid, which is used in various classical and new hydrometallurgical processes.

The Centre for Sustainable Resource Processing (CSRP) undertakes applied research to further advance regional synergies in the Kwinana Industrial Area in Western Australia in order to achieve greater efficiencies in water, energy and materials consumption and reduction in waste and emission generation. The Kwinana Industries Council (KIC) and its member organisations recognise water consumption and isposal as key environmental issues. Some 30 companies in Kwinana consume a total of more than 35 000 ML/yr of fresh water. Over the past years significant progress has been made towards the reduction of water consumption and improvements in effluent disposal. As part of the CSRP Kwinana Synergies Project, water balances for the ten major water consuming companies have been completed, including workshop sessions with company staff on water synergy opportunities. This work resulted in a set of synergy opportunities which are currently being pursued. In parallel to the Kwinana project, the CSRP has commissioned a supporting project that delivers a toolkit to guide a more targeted and less resource intensive way to identify feasible water synergy opportunities. One of these tools focuses specifically on water, and takes count of input and output water flows within a given industrial area to deliver listings of prioritised water synergy opportunities. This paper discusses the water mapping and workshop approach taken in Kwinana and its outcomes, which are to identify and evaluate water synergy opportunities.

The models used constant anthropogenic emissions from IIASA/EDGAR3.2 and monthly emissions from biomass burning based on the 1997-2002 average carbon emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). Model output is analyzed at 10:30 local time, close to the overpass time of the ERS-2 satellite, and collocated with the measurements to account for sampling biases due to incomplete spatiotemporal coverage of the instrument. We assessed the importance of different contributions to the sampling bias: correlations on seasonal time scale give rise to a positive bias of 30-50% in the retrieved annual means over regions dominated by emissions from biomass burning. Over the industrial regions of the eastern United States, Europe and eastern China the retrieved annual means have a negative bias with significant contributions (between -25% and +10% of the NO2 column) resulting from correlations on time scales from a day to a month. We present global maps of modeled and retrieved annual mean NO 2 column densities, together with the corresponding ensemble means and standard deviations for models and retrievals. The spatial correlation between the individual models and retrievals are high, typically in the range 0.81-0.93 after smoothing the data to a common resolution. On average the models underestimate the retrievals in industrial regions, especially over eastern China and over the Highveld region of South Africa, and overestimate the retrievals in regions dominated by biomass burning during the dry season. The discrepancy over South America south of the Amazon disappears when we use the GFED emissions specific to the year 2000. The seasonal cycle is analyzed in detail for eight different continental regions. Over regions dominated by biomass burning, the timing of the seasonal cycle is generally well reproduced by the models. However, over Central Africa south of the Equator the models peak one to two months earlier than the retrievals. We further evaluate a recent proposal to reduce the NOX emission factors for savanna fires by 40% and find that this leads to an improvement of the amplitude of the seasonal cycle over the biomass burning regions of Northern and Central Africa. In these regions the models tend to underestimate the retrievals during the wet season, suggesting that the soil emissions are higher than assumed in the models. In general, the discrepancies between models and retrievals cannot be explained by a priori profile assumptions made in the retrievals, neither by diurnal variations in anthropogenic emissions, which lead to a marginal reduction of the NO2 abundance at 10:30 local time (by 2.5-4.1% over Europe). Overall, there are significant differences among the various models and, in particular, among the three retrievals. The discrepancies among the retrievals (10-50% in the annual mean over polluted regions) indicate that the previously estimated retrieval uncertainties have a large systematic component. Our findings imply that top-down estimations of NOX emissions from satellite retrievals of tropospheric NO2 are strongly dependent on the choice of model and retrieval.",,"anthropogenic source; biomass burning; comparative study; ERS-2; GOME; nitrous oxide; sampling bias; timescale; troposphere; Africa; Asia; Central Africa; China; Eurasia; Europe; Far East; North America; South Africa; South America; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746265191

In countries such as Sweden the national translation of the directives' requirements will lead to dryer landfills with relatively more municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration residues. Numerous landfills have been closed before the initially envisaged date. They will not be subject to the advanced closing procedure for landfills according to the translation of the EU directives. Together with former unengineered dumps, these landfills will outnumber the compliant landfills by far. The former are neither subject to the Swedish national translation of the Landfill Directives nor to any other EU or national legislation. Often lacking active and even passive barrier systems, the emission potential of these landfills seems to be able to overshadow that of the reduced number of remaining EU directive-compliant landfills. These landfills will eventually be regarded as contaminated areas. In countries such as Sweden a substitution of MSW landfills by incineration facilities will result in a more rapid and likely increased release of carbon dioxide emissions (among other air pollutants) per tonne of produced waste. Thus, a comparative assessment of the overall impact of waste management options on different timescales for emissions should be done on a country-by-country basis to assess sustainability of the translation of the Landfill Directives. The physical-chemical and microbiological properties of the resulting storage conditions governing the landfills' emission potentials are unknown to a great extent. A prolonged risk of relevant emissions has to be taken into account for compliant landfills due to possible moisture scarcity and subsequent slower degradation rates. On the one hand, leaching of degradation products could be extended, albeit in reduced concentrations. On the other hand, longer contact time with water can enhance leaching of, for example, hydrophilic substances. Concentration and/or mass peaks might be postponed compared to earlier, 'wetter' landfilling with a higher content of easily degradable organic waste. Without addressing and answering these uncertainties, it remains doubtful it the national translation of the Landfill Directives will lead to sustainable waste management in the long run. © 2006 WIT Press.","Landfill; Legislation; Long-term emissions; Storage conditions; Sustainable waste management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847342188

Modeling tools such as the California Modal Emissions Model can be used to measure the emissions impacts of ETC and other electronic screening (e-screening) facilities only on light-duty gasoline-fueled vehicle operations. No such tools exist for modeling of the emissions impacts of ETC and e-screening facilities on heavy-duty vehicle operations. This paper presents a speed profile discretization (SPD) technique for modeling emissions at ETC and e-screening facilities. The SPD technique is based on the MOBILE6.2 method of representing vehicle miles of travel in various speed bins. The technique defines an emissions influence zone within which speed profiles are altered and further determine vehicle emissions. With this technique, the emissions impacts of heavy-duty trucks at the toll collection plaza on the George Washington Bridge in New York City are estimated. The current mix of cash and E-ZPass transactions on the George Washington Bridge are shown to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hydrocarbons (HCs), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) within the emissions influence zone. The degree of reduction is dependent on the speed with which E-ZPass vehicles are processed.

Lean is based on the premise that compressing time reveals hidden quality problems and that their resolution leads to more efficient, cost-effective business processes. If time compression always implies lower emissions, then a leaner system is always greener as measured by emissions. If time compression does not always lead to lower emissions, then further changes to the lean system may be required in order to make it greener. We use a simulation model of a generic supply chain as well as two representative examples of supply chains to examine this. Our analysis shows that supply chain emissions are highly sensitive to the frequency and mode of delivery of goods as well as the type and amount of inventory stored at each company. Our results suggest that lean supply chains are not necessarily green, although they could turn out to be green in certain cases. The main impediment appears to be distance. While lean supply chains typically have lower emissions due to reduced inventory levels, the frequent replenishment at every point in the provision stream generally tends to increase the emissions. If a lean supply chain is located entirely within a small region, then it would almost certainly be green from an emissions perspective due to the low levels of inventory and short shipping distances. As distances increase along the supply chain, it is quite possible for lean and green to be in conflict, leading to tradeoffs as well as additional opportunities for optimization.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Environmental performance; Lean; Lean and green; Supply chains","Carbon dioxide emissions; Delivery of goods; Environmental performance; Key performance indicators; Lean; Lean and green; Lean supply chains; Supply chain emissions; Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Contracts; Environmental management; Global warming; Supply chains",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875576827

As specific as this case might be, it is one of the many experiments we witness in recent environmental policies throughout Europe. Target group policy is paralleled indeed by a wide variety of new policy approaches aiming at more integrated and more interactive environmental policy making, as other chapters in this volume illustrate. Despite their differences, these experiments basically reflect the quest for a more effective policy on the one hand, while illustrating gradually changing relations between state, market and civil society on the other. As such they are said to represent new styles and practices of governance. The empirical question arises, however, whether and to what extent these new practices actually represent a new environmental policy and under what conditions they institutionalise as new forms of governance. We restrict to new government-industry relations in environmental policies here. Since the late 1980s we witness the emergence of different voluntary approaches in this area: covenants, public-private partnerships and other voluntary agreements between state agencies and industrial branches' representatives, both at national and European level (Carraro and Lévêque, 1999; EEA, 1997; Glasbergen, 1998; Mol et al., 2000; OECD, 1999; OECD, 2003). These new policy approaches have been developed, often in combination with more traditional instruments, to take into account concerns of target groups. A specific example are target group policies, as developed in many EU countries, in particular in the Netherlands and at European level from the 1990s onwards (Driessen and Glasbergen, 2002). Target group policies, firstly, imply the elaboration of environmental policies for specific target groups such as industry, agriculture and consumers. Governmental agencies and branches of industry negotiate on feasible goals for emission reductions or, more pro-actively, for reductions in the use of resources. The subsequent agreements often result in covenants dealing with issues on products and processes, and setting a commonly agreed timetable. At first one might consider this as yet a further step in the differentiation and specification of environmental policy. From a strategic perspective target group policies this can be regarded as the preliminary outcome of the perpetual quest for more effective environmental policies. The implementation of these target policies, however, is explicitly a common responsibility of government and industry representatives. Hence, from an institutional perspective, target group policies also represent new practices of policy making, introducing new interrelations between government and industry, anticipating new institutional patterns. As such, target group policies refer to new modes of governance. In the 1990s the Flemish government announced a so-called 'target group policy' in environmental policy. It was said to aim at policy integration and at target groups' participation, and echoed the quest and ambitions evoked above. A project team was set up to explore the opportunities, and to launch a pilot programme in which governmental agencies and representatives from two industrial sectors are involved. This chapter describes this approach and project, firstly in order to assess whether it indeed represents the so-called shift from government to governance and, secondly, whether it will institutionalise as such. We assess whether target group policies tend to supersede traditional policies, or whether, to the contrary, traditional policies tend to restrain target group policies. To answer these questions we focus on the goals and ambitions of this target group policy, on its actual development and on its chances to trigger real policy change. The first section sets out our perspective and conceptual framework. Section two describes the development of Flemish target group policy. Section three then analyses target group policy as a newly emerging arrangement and looks for explanations for its (lack of) triggering a real policy change in Flemish environmental policies. In the final section some conclusions are drawn. © 2006 Springer.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349788951

The current Mayan house keeps the same form and characteristics, just as the prehispanic house is represented in old paintings and sculptures; almost always it is placed on a platform whose height varies according with the slope of the land. In the lower areas the plant of the house is characterized for the apses that round off the lateral parts, giving him an elliptic form. In contrast, the Mayan house in the high lands presents a rectangular plant. Climate defines different requirements of protection: from excessive radiation, heat, cold, rainfall, undesirable winds, floods and other natural phenomena. Place determines available resources and constructive materials. Therefore typical and regional architectonical characteristic come up from climate and location. In spite of the climatic differences due to altitude and some materials, the characteristic form and the outline of the constructive system remain. Therefore, we can define this architecture as a cultural phenomenon with an appropriate regional answer according to the particular climatic and environmental conditions.","Architecture; Bio-climate; Mayan; Traditional architecture; Vernacular","Bio-climate; Climatic regions; Constructive materials; Constructive systems; Environmental conditions; Mayan; Me-xico; Natural phenomena; Traditional architecture; Vernacular; Warm climates; Architecture; Houses; Radiation protection; Climatology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865801968

Shell aspires to attain zero flaring by end 2008 and so gas commercialization and the subsequent need to plan the size and quality of the various associated and non-associated gas streams; SPDC can no longer simply maximise oil production from its reservoirs, without first performing integrated capacity planning checks. With Associated Gas (AG) being routed to NLNG, there exist a high value optimization opportunity of supply and demand between the SPDC's fields and wells, the capacity of the various oil and gas processing plants (e.g. flow stations, terminals, associated and non-associated gas plants) and pipelines, and the requirements of SPDC's various gas customers. HFPT addresses problems that cannot be resolved by stand-alone reservoir or surface facilities models and as such brings significant business benefits. In order to address the above, various models are used in SPDC. The Corporate model describes all 3000+ oil drainage points and is used for annual reserves reporting and for the yearly business planning cycle. The model directly connects to a database.

Concerning JT-60U, two different types of bursting modes have been observed by MHD spectrography in auxiliary heated (NNB) discharges. One of these modes has been dubbed fast frequency sweeping (fast FS) mode. It is characterized by a timescale of the order of few milliseconds and frequencies branching upwards and downwards. The other mode, called the abrupt large-amplitude event (ALE), has shorter timescale (order of hundred microseconds) and larger amplitude. On the occurrence of ALEs, a significant reduction of the neutron emission rate in the central plasma region is observed. Such a change has been attributed to a redistribution of the energetic ions, with a marked reduction of their on-axis density. We present an interpretation of these experimental observations, based on the results of nonlinear particle simulations performed by the Hybrid MHD-Gyrokinetic Code HMGC. Concerning ITER, monotonic-q (scenario 2) and reversed-shear (scenario 4) equilibria are considered. Also an ITER hybrid scenario is examined and quantitatively compared with the previous ones. The transition from the low-amplitude Alfvénic instability saturation to the secondary excitation of a stronger mode is addressed, and its effect on the energetic particle transport analyzed. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.","Abruptlarge-amplitude event; ALE; Alfvén modes; Burning plasmas; Fast particles; Hybrid MHD-Gyrokinetic code; ITER; ITER scenarios; JT-60U",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846984251

An add-on system was developed using a production Engine Control Module. In this system, compressed natural gas (CNG) is added into the intake air stream and a pilot injection of diesel fuel is used to achieve ignition. One advantage of the Diesel-CNG system over a diesel engine converted to CNG usage using spark ignition is that the engine can operate in a diesel only mode; not reducing the resale price of the vehicle to regions less served with CNG fueling stations. Pilot diesel fuel injection provides a reliable mode of ignition for lean mixtures of CNG, compared to conventional spark ignition.

In Brazil the abundance of natural gas, together with the need to reduce green house gases emissions and noise of urban busses, presented the opportunity to develop a Diesel-CNG control for Diesel engines using a mechanical diesel pump. An add-on system was developed using a production Engine Control Module. In this system, compressed natural gas (CNG) is added into the intake air stream and a pilot injection of diesel is used to achieve ignition. One advantage of the Diesel-CNG system over a diesel engine converted to CNG usage using spark ignition is that the engine can operate in a diesel only mode; not reducing the resale price of the vehicle to regions less served with CNG fueling stations. Pilot diesel injection provides a reliable mode of ignition for lean mixtures of CNG, compared to conventional spark ignition. This paper will describe the Diesel-CNG system in detail and present some performance data.

The initial study of the CO level at the train station was performed without mechanical ventilation at the train station platform. Three different cases were examined by varying the wind magnitude and direction. Subsequently, four extra scenarios were examined with and without mechanical ventilation. The results obtained from the scenario with mechanical ventilation were compared to the ones from the scenario without mechanical ventilation. In all the above cases, the CO emissions from the vehicles in the two nearby highways were also taken into account. It is concluded that the maximum CO level in the case with mechanical ventilation is higher than in the case without. This is due to recirculation zones that create locally high levels of CO in the platform area. On the other hand, the average level of CO is lower at the platform with the ventilation on. © 2006 WIT Press.","Emissions level; Mechanical ventilation; Numerical prediction","Airports; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Flow of fluids; Gas emissions; Emissions level; Mechanical ventilation; Numerical prediction; Aerodynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148986516

The possibility of obtaining instant and measurable reductions of 10 percent or more in fuel consumption has finally arrived. Due to the efforts of a small Romanian company a groundbreaking technology, known as ECOBIK®, can deliver all of these benefits The ECOBIK® process works by treating combustion air and interacting with fuel at the combustion stage, thus increasing fuel efficiency and lowering emissions on furnaces and boilers. This combustion control technology involves the use of an internationally patented aerosol injection system that is linked directly to the combustion reaction. Thus it alters the combustion process, allowing for a more complete and efficient oxidation of previously unburned molecules. Avogadro Environmental Corporation in Easton, PA is working with our partners in Romania and has finally made this technology available in the United States. ECOBIK® has the potential to reduce emissions of CO, NOx, SOx, and VOC by as much as 25%, 10%, 99% and 90% respectively, along with 10-25% reductions in operating and maintenance costs. With over twelve years of continuous use in Eastern Europe, over a million hours of testing on over 100 boilers and furnaces, ISO 9001 certification, and the move from test sites to commercialized installation at plants in the US, the expectations are high. The benefits to this technology are enormous. Along with the emissions reductions, there is a reduction in the wear and corrosion of combustion equipment, regardless of fuel type. Best of all, there is virtually no capital investment involved.","Aerosol injection; Combustion; Ecobik®; Emissions reductions","Aerosol injection; Combustion control technology; Fuel costs; Aerosols; Combustion; Energy efficiency; Fuel consumption; Gas furnaces; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Volatile organic compounds; Emission control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247135536

Environmental regulations have increasingly focused on the automobile itself and more recently on the fuel combusted in automobile engines. The attainment of emissions standards at the local and regional level has led to a rapid increase in the number of distinct special motor vehicle fuels known as 'boutique' fuels. The great heterogeneity in motor fuel markets has further stressed the supply infrastructure and this has resulted in higher and more volatile gasoline prices. In this paper we provide a descriptive empirical analysis of wholesale gasoline prices across the U.S. in relation to environmental concerns. We find that adding more fuels to the supply chain has increased overall fuel prices, in particular for those areas using unique gasoline blends. In addition, the rapid spread of unique gasoline blends increases the likelihood of supply disruptions, particularly in cities or areas that are isolated by virtue of using an uncommon motor fuel or because they are located far from sources of supply.","Boutique fuels; Environmental standards; Fuel prices; Vehicular emissions","Boutique fuels; Environmental standards; Fuel prices; Vehicular emissions; Air pollution; Automobile engines; Automobiles; Environmental protection; Laws and legislation; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846548563

Three LANDSAT images (1978 MSS, 1987 TM and 2000 ETM) were used to estimate changes in the size of six land-use categories (forest, cropland, urban, wetland, lakes/rivers and coastal water). Coefficients which integrated from Costanza et al.'s (1997) ecosystem services valuation model and Xie Gaodi et al.'s (2003) ""ecosystem services value unit area of Chinese terrestrial ecosystems"" were used to estimate changes in ecosystem services delivered by each land categories, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the affecting factors of ecosystem service value. The total annual ecosystem service values in coastal area of Lianyungang City decreased from RMB 8.23×109 in 1978 to RMB 7.53×109 in 1987, however it increased from RMB 7.53×109 in 1987 to RMB 10.73×109 in 2000. The decline of ecosystem service value from 1978 to 1987 is largely attributable to 53.49% loss of forest at the same period, while the increase of service value is contributed by 147.70% increase of wetland from 1987 to 2000. Change of wetland and forest has the major contribution to the change of total ecosystem service value of Liangyungang city. Waste treatment, water supply and climate regulation are the dominant ecosystem services of this area.

Ab initio density functional theory calculation was carried out to explore the reaction mechanism at the G2//B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. The reaction mechanism showed that the HCNO + CO product channel is the most favorable. The first step in this channel was a barrierless process to form an intermediate complex ON··CHCO. The second step was the break of C-C bond to produce HCNO and CO via a low potential barrier. Other two reaction channels involved producing the HONC + CO and HCN + CO2 products. To reveal the kinetic property of this reaction, the variational transition state theory and RRKM theory were used to calculate the rate constants for every channel. The kinetic calculation showed that the predicted results are in good agreement with the recent experimental data.

It relies on the normative use of economic market models, transaction cost theory, and public choice theories to deliver public services. While the manifestations of this new approach have taken many different avenues across the world, in the United States the primary manifestations have been found in the ""Reinventing Government"" movement (Gore, 1993), and the ""Competitive Sourcing"" plan of the Bush Administration (Office Management and Budget, 2002, 2003). A central component of NPM practices in the United States is the use of ""outsourcing"" of government service delivery to private or non-profit organizations. Fueling the development of NPM in the United States have been the fiscal problems faced by local, state, and federal governments since the 1970s. Governments in the United States are faced with conflicting pressures to increase the levels of service delivery, but to do so in a climate of reducing taxes. Advocates of NPM claim that reliance on NPM principles will promote efficiency and cost savings in government, thus allowing service levels to rise while limiting cost and tax increases (Rondinelli, 2003; Savas, 1987). On the other hand, critics of NPM claim that outsourcing cases in this country often result in either failures to deliver services or outright corruption. The end result, according to the critics of NPM, is that government capacity is hollowed-out, and, ultimately, democratic accountability to the citizen is lost (deLeon & Denhardt, 2000; Milward, 1996). The library profession has also been influenced by the emergence of NPM. During the past 30 years, outsourcing has been adopted by the library profession, especially in terms of internal operations. The extensive development of outsourcing in the library profession eventually led to a study being conducted by the American Library Association on this area of service delivery (Martin, 2000). The section of the Martin study related to the outsourcing of public library management generated controversy in the library profession and reflected the broader debate occurring in the public management field over the use of NPM principles for the delivery of government services. We restrict the current study to public libraries (local government libraries of general scope intended for public use); other types of libraries such as Federal governmental departmental libraries and military libraries will form the subject of another study. In essence, NPM makes little or no distinction between the role of government in society and free market principles. To NPM advocates, government should not be run like a business, but rather business should run government (Lane, 2000). To these advocates of NPM, substitution of public goods theories with concepts such as decentralization, market competition, deregulation, load shedding, privatization, user fees, and enterprise management leads to a more responsive government service (Arnold, 1998; Ferlie, 1996). In public administration, opposition to NPM reflects a more traditional view of the public sector which emphasizes a positive role for public service in our society (Frederickson, 1996). The public administration critics of NPM charge that NPM undermines representative democracy, and circumvents constitutional systems developed to sustain democracy by removing public accountability from government (Goodsell, 1993; Moe, 1994; Terry, 1998). A similar level of debate has emerged in the library profession. NPM advocates in the library profession claim that only the use of outsourcing will save public libraries from fiscal extinction (Dubberly, 1998). Opponents of NPM in the library field, on the other hand, believe that the use of outsourcing, especially in public library management, will result in the loss of democratic accountability, and the eventual privatization of public libraries (Schuman, 1998). The end result of this debate is that NPM advocates in the library profession call for embracing the movement, and opponents call for active opposition to the movement. The Use of Outsourcing for Public Library Management: While the debate over the application of NPM principles in the library profession reflects the broader debate raging in public management, often the debate is based more on emotions than fact. In an attempt to sort emotions from fact, we have assumed the task of examining actual cases involving the application of NPM principles to public library management. We seek to discover if the application of such principles have led to the proposed increases in services claimed by the advocates of NPM, or if it has resulted in the reduction in public accountability postulated by the NPM critics. Of the thousands of public libraries in the United States, at the time of this research project, we have found only eight cases in which outsourcing of the management of a public library has occurred. Of the eight cases, only seven cases have data available for examining this phenomenon. The seven cases are: Calabasas, CaliforniaHemet, CaliforniaRiverside County, CaliforniaJersey City, New JerseyLinden, New JerseyFargo, North DakotaLancaster, Texas. The outsourcing of the management of a public library as opposed to the outsourcing of particular functions such as cataloging, binding, and building maintenance, is not a common practice in the United States. To this day, the vast majority of public libraries continue to operate as either public board systems or as in-line agencies of local governments. An examination of these seven cases shows that the reasons for such a decision to outsource the management often reflect the emergence of unusual conditions not normally associated with the operation of a public library.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645926699

Upon ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, Canada committed, through the 2008-2012 commitment period, to reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 570 MT eCO 2, from 1990 levels of 610 MT eCO 2. The solid waste sector in Canada generated 24 MT eCO 2 in 2000, 23 MT eCO 2 of which were produced by landfill gas (LFG). The transport of waste likely generated a further 740 kT eCO 2 that are not accounted for in the waste sector by the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. It is likely that waste transport emissions will increase as fewer landfills are sited and further source separation of wastes occurs. The benefits of source reduction, recycling, LFG capture for energy recovery, composting, anaerobic digestion and incineration are discussed. This paper presents an estimation of the GHG emissions from the solid waste sector using the waste disposal, recycling, and composting data from Ottawa, Canada for the year 1999, as well as the results of an audit of residential units performed the same year. This evaluation determined that, among the options examined, waste incineration, further source separ-ation of recyclables, and anaerobic digestion of organic wastes have the greatest benefits for reducing GHG emissions in the City of Ottawa's waste sector.

Design/methodology/ approach - Questionnaire data from 51 buyers in automaker firms and 72 supplier firms were subjected to K-means cluster analyses to establish relationship groups in the two samples. Differences across the groups were tested using ANOVA and Scheffé tests. Findings - Three relationship types (captive supplier, market exchange, and strategic partnership) were identified both in the buyer and supplier data. Significant differences were observed in terms of contextual (product and supplier characteristics), managerial (information exchange and cooperation), and social climate variables (mutual understanding, payoff equity, and satisfaction). Turkish buyers were found to strategically segment their suppliers based on product and supplier characteristics, whereas supplier groups were differentiated along social climate variables. Research limitations/implications - The Turkish results differ somewhat from the ones for developed countries, which suggests that more work should be conducted in emerging economies. Future research that uses matched pairs of buyers and suppliers may provide in-depth insights. Practical implications - The results demonstrated a perception (hence, communication) gap between buyers and suppliers in how they differentiated relationship types. Strategic partnership led to cooperation in both samples, and to satisfaction, mutual understanding, and equity in the supplier sample. Originality/value - This study used data from both parties, contrasted buyer-supplier relationships in an emerging market with those in developed markets, and highlighted the effects of the industry's historical evolution on the present state of buyer-supplier relationships. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Automotive industry; Buyers; Developing countries; Suppliers; Supply chain management; Turkey",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747101985

Once the sedimentary sequence and the diversity of organic preservation had been established, it became evident that a refined series of multiple carbon dates was essential to assure sound correlation with virtually any other set of prehistoric events from local to regional and even to a global perspective. In the half century since the radiocarbon method was established it has become the primary standard for communication about chronology within the many interrelated disciplines dealing with the Quaternary. During the past 20 years the application of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to dating radioactive carbon reduced the required sample size from many grams to a few milligrams (Taylor, 1992). Where previously a bone date might require the whole bone of an ungulate, now a tooth of a rodent provides an ample sample. An additional practical advantage of AMS dates is that use of a pinpoint sample goes far toward eliminating potential contaminants that were often incorporated into old-style bulk samples. Throughout this book diverse specialists turn to the carbon-dated framework to integrate and correlate their discussions which range from climatic events and environmental patterns to aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna and finally to human cultures. Therefore the validity of the carbon dates and their placement within the site profiles become fundamental. In this chapter we describe the field methods by which we acquired carbon samples and the lab procedures by which we submitted them to three major labs. We also discuss various issues regarding sample biases and consider current issues concerning calibration curves and calendar corrections. Finally, we present the essential results by which the Page-Ladson Site complex can claim century-scale chronology for a critical interval of ten millenia. This framework of dates, tied directly to the physical stratigraphy, extends from the time of the last glacial maximum, ca. 18,500 14C BP, to a time just after the final retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, ca. 8200 14C BP.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65249166613

These limitations initially triggered the development of laser ignition as an effective alternative, first only for gas engines and now for a much wider range of internal combustion engines revealing a number of immediate advantages like no electrode erosion or flame kernel quenching. Furthermore and most noteworthy, already the very first engine tests about 5 years ago had resulted in a drastic reduction of NOx emissions. Within this broad range investigation, laser plasmas were generated by ns Nd-laser pulses and characterized by emission and Schlieren diagnostic methods. High-pressure chamber experiments with lean hydrogen-methane-air mixtures were successfully performed and allowed the determination of essential parameters like minimum pulse energies at different ignition pressures and temperatures as well as at variable fuel air compositions. Multipoint ignition was studied for different ignition point locations. In this way, relevant parameters were acquired allowing to estimate future laser ignition systems. Finally, a prototype diode-pumped passively Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was tested successfully at a gasoline engine allowing to monitor the essential operation characteristics. It is expected that laser ignition involving such novel solid-state lasers will allow much lower maintenance efforts.","High-pressure gas mixtures; Laser ignition; Laser-initiated combustion; Lean gas mixtures; Methane and hydrogen fuels; Multipoint ignition; Schlieren spectroscopy","Density (specific gravity); Electrodes; Erosion; Internal combustion engines; Laser applications; Q switched lasers; High-pressure gas mixtures; Laser ignition; Laser-initiated combustion; Lean gas mixtures; Methane and hydrogen fuels; Multipoint ignition; Schlieren spectroscopy; Ignition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645218531

This area includes a series of intracratonic basins along the northern margin of the West African Craton which consists (from W to E) of the Reggane Basin, Azel Matti Ridge, Ahnet Basin, Foum Belrem Ridge and Mouydir Basin. The depositional and palaeogeographic interpretation is based on 71 sections in this region, which for the first time were biostratigraphically calibrated by means of conodonts, goniatites and brachiopods. The structural evolution during Devonian times was probably controlled by reactivation of ancient N-S- to NW-SE-running faults in the Precambrian basement, which caused differential subsidence and uplift of a previously largely unstructured siliciclastic shelf. A hiatus during Emsian times indicates widespread emergence during this interval. The entire area was flooded during the earliest Eifelian, when the first vestiges of the Azel Matti Ridge become evident by stratigraphic condensation. The palaeogeographic differentiation is most apparent during the Givetian, when a shoal with reduced carbonate sedimentation was established on the Azel Matti Ridge passing towards the west and east into basinal environments of the Reggane and Ahnet basins, respectively. The Foum Belrem Ridge is distinguished by increased subsidence during the early Givetian and by revived uplift during the late Givetian. In the Mouydir Basin further east, up to 1000 m of shales were deposited during the Givetian. The early Frasnian is marked by the ubiquitous sedimentation of black shales and bituminous styliolinites. These lithologies occur repeatedly already during the Middle Devonian and document intermittent anoxic conditions. The basin and ridge topography is levelled by the shallowing-up sequence of up to 1400 m thick upper Frasnian and Famennian shales which grade into a deltaic sequence of uppermost Famennian/Tournaisian sandstones. The up to now only vaguely discriminated lithostratigraphic formations of the Devonian have been biostratigraphically defined in suitable type sections. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.","Algerian Sahara; Basin Evolution; Biostratigraphy; Devonian; Palaegeography","Biostratigraphy; Stratigraphy; Topography; Algerian Sahara; Basin evolution; Carbonate sedimentations; Devonians; Differential subsidence; Palaegeography; Precambrian basement; Sedimentary evolution; Subsidence; basin evolution; biostratigraphy; Devonian; paleogeography; subsidence; tectonic evolution; uplift; Africa; Algeria; North Africa; Brachiopoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748269478

The development of a swirl-induced inner recirculation zone, which provides heat and active chemical species to the ignition domain of the flame, plays an important role for stabilisation of these highly turbulent flames. Modern concepts for reducing thermal NOx emissions require high ignition stability even if very lean fuel/air-mixtures are in use. Therefore, there is a great demand for models which are able to predict lean blow out of turbulent, aerodynamically stabilised flames. In contrast to the integral approach of many stability models which mostly are based on global quantities, numerical models offer highest possible flexibility aiming at variation of geometry, operating conditions and further parameters. For solving the convective-diffusive problem, a RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes) method based on a finite volume approach is applied, using the standard k-ε turbulence model. A joint-probability-density model with an assumed shape of the probability-density-function (presumed shape JPDF-model) describes the interaction of turbulence and chemical reaction. The latter is based on one single variable, describing the mixing state and one single variable, describing the state of reaction progress. The demand, to apply a chemical reaction mechanism, which is based on one single reaction progress variable, is solved by using the concept of the semi-global 2-domain-l-step chemical kinetics scheme. To predict lean blow out for confined diffusive swirl-flames makes it necessary to take into account the convective and radiative heat loss processes. To consider the influence of heat loss on the chemical reaction, the 2-domain-1-step chemical kinetics scheme had to be extended. The local distribution of heat loss inside the flow field is covered by a variable named ""enthalpy-index"", which describes the normalised ratio of the local enthalpy and local enthalpy under adiabatic conditions for a given mixture composition. With this combined model LBO (Lean Blow Out) limits have been deduced for a Methane/Air-flame in a model gas turbine combustor. The results confirm, that lean blow out is predicted at much lower thermal loads if taking heat loss processes into account.

In turn, fish levels of mercury will drop differentially in different parts of the U.S., depending on upwind sources of mercury and how those change. Modeling has been carried out for each state with sufficient fish mercury data, using a combined modeling framework of a costing/emissions model for mercury under base and regulated scenarios; an atmospheric fate, transport, and deposition model; the results from the EPRI Mercury Cycling Model for various watersheds, and emerging data from national fish sampling by the U.S. EPA and the various states. Changes in deposition by state under each base and regulatory scenario translate into moderate lowering of mercury in fish (the multiyear periods over which emissions reductions and, later, reductions of mercury in fish and freshwater systems occur have been ignored). The susceptibility of each state population to lower exposure is calculated by modifying regional fish consumption rates by the proportion of state population engaged in sport fishing. Results indicate that, with a 70% drop by 2020 in utility mercury emissions under proposed Cap and Trade, exposure by state will drop from a fraction of a percent in the western U.S. to over 6% in West Virginia (due primarily to sportfishing fractions in each state).

The principal means of reducing this loss have been to minimise the tip gap and/or to apply a rotating shroud to the rotor. Tip clearance control systems continue to improve, but a practical limit on tip gap remains. Recently winglets have been identified by a number of researchers as having potential, but none have yet to enter commercial service. Harvey & Ramsden [1] presented a novel design of one, analysis of which indicated that it could significantly reduce OTL loss. This Part 2 paper presents the analysis of such a winglet which had been designed onto a rotor blade of a research high pressure turbine. The tests were carried out as part of the ANTLE (Advanced Near Term Low Emissions) technology demonstrator programme and are described in detail in Harvey et al [2]. The current paper emphasises the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations as a means of better understanding the overall successful experimental result in more depth. The turbine efficiency was measured for three different tip gaps over a range of conditions. In addition detailed measurements of the flow field were taken, principally exit area traverses and rotor surface static pressures. These experimental results are very encouraging and show a high potential for further development. Comparison of the detailed hot-wire data with state of the art Rolls-Royce in-house codes, such as HYDRA, show a very good agreement. It is suggested that such CFD tools are now at a level of capability where they can be used to better understand test data and further optimise the winglet aerodynamic design.

Surveying a facility for potential gas leaks can be a daunting task. Industrial leak detection and repair programs can be expensive to administer. An efficient, accurate and cost effective method for detecting and quantifying gas leaks would both save industries money by identifying production losses and improve regional air quality. Specialized thermal video systems have proven effective in rapidly locating gas leaks. These systems, however, do not have the spectral resolution for compound identification. Passive FTIR spectrometers can be used for gas compound identification, but using these systems for facility surveys is problematic due to their small field of view. A hybrid approach has been developed that utilizes the thermal video system to locate gas plumes using real time visualization of the leaks, coupled with the high spectral resolution FTIR spectrometer for compound identification and quantification. The prototype hybrid video/spectrometer system uses a sterling cooled thermal camera, operating in the MWIR (3-5 μm) with an additional notch filter set at around 3.4 μm, which allows for the visualization of gas compounds that absorb in this narrow spectral range, such as alkane hydrocarbons. This camera is positioned alongside of a portable, high speed passive FTIR spectrometer, which has a spectral range of 2 - 25 μm and operates at 4 cm-1 resolution. This system uses a 10 cm telescope foreoptic with an onboard blackbody for calibration. The two units are optically aligned using a turning mirror on the spectrometer's telescope with the video camera's output.","FTIR; Gas detection; Infrared; Spectroscopy; Thermography","Air quality; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Optical resolving power; Particulate emissions; Thermography (imaging); Video cameras; Fugitive emissions; Gas detection; Industrial leak detection; Thermal video systems; Infrared spectrometers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750569170

It is a well-known fact that diesel hybrid technology is being used increasingly to improve the performance of a number of city transit buses. The exclusive combination of advanced diesel engines and sophisticated hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technologies holds much promise for dramatic reductions in both emissions as well as fuel consumption. Currently, transit bus manufacturers incorporate the popularly accepted series or parallel hybrid electric drive train architectures for hybridization depending on specific performance demands. From the point of view of heavy-duty vehicular drive train hybridization, a major debate in the auto industry involves analyzing and comparing both the series as well as parallel HEV systems. Keeping this issue in mind, this paper aims to comprehensively investigate and evaluate series and parallel hybrid electric drive train topologies for heavy-duty diesel transit buses from the point of view of overall efficiency and parametric performance studies. In general, the vital proposal of this paper involves the depiction of suitability of parallel hybrid drive trains over series hybrid drive trains, more specific to city transit bus applications. © 2006 IEEE.","Diesel engines; Hybrid electric vehicle; Modeling; Simulation; Traction motor drives","Auto industry; Drive train; Fair share; Heavy-duty diesel; Hybrid drive train; Hybrid electric drives; Hybrid electric vehicle; Hybrid technology; Hybrid-electric vehicle technologies; Overall efficiency; Parametric performance; Simulation; Traction motor drives; Automobiles; Bus transportation; Buses; Electric drives; Electric vehicles; Models; Propulsion; Secondary batteries; Traction motors; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81455135142

This decision was made to comply with the Minnesota hierarchy for solid waste management, to extend the life of the Polk County landfill, and to recover valuable energy from the waste. The plant was constructed in 1987 and began burning MSW in 1988. The processing technology consisted of two starved air mass burn municipal solid waste combustors each with a combustion capacity of 40 tons of MSW per day, and produced energy in the form of saturated steam for customers in the adjacent industrial park. Initially each train utilized a two field electrostatic precipitator (ESP) as the air pollution control (APC) device. In 1996, a materials recovery system (MRF) was constructed in front of the waste combustors to remove problem/objectionable items most of which are recyclable. This facility has been a tremendous success providing many benefits including reduced stack emissions, lower O & M costs for the WTE units, and revenues from the sales of extracted recyclables. In 1998 Polk began injecting powdered activated carbon (PAC) into the flue gas of each unit upstream of the ESP to attain compliance with new State limits for dioxin/rurans and mercury. Then in 2000 Polk County proceeded with an APC retrofit project designed to meet revised EPA emission guidelines which set more stringent limits for pollutants currently regulated and added limits for several other pollutants previously unregulated.. In 2001 and 2004 Polk County performed research demonstration projects substituting screened WTE combined ash for a portion of natural aggregate in two asphalt road construction projects. Both projects passed stringent environmental testing and demonstrated superior strength and flexibility performance compared to conventional asphalt. Polk County is now proceeding with the installation of a turbine/generator to produce renewable electricity with excess steam. The electricity produced will be used to reduce the demand for incoming power from the local utility. Initially this may be only a twenty-five percent reduction but has the potential to be more in the event one or more of the steam customers reduces their dependence on steam from the WTE plant. All of these projects received funding assistance from the State of Minnesota in the form of Capital Assistance Grants. In 2003 the WTE plant and MRF became debt free and Polk County lowered the tip fee resulting in a disposal rate that is fairly competitive with that of most out of state landfills. This paper will discuss the development, success, and benefits of this completely integrated solid waste management system for these five counties located in Northwest Minnesota.

Such processes are characterised by adequate combustion control that helps to avoid areas of high local flame temperatures, which lead to NOx formation, and fuel rich combustion areas which promote soot formation. In most cases, this will be achieved by a complete or partial charge homogenisation prior to combustion. Four processes of alternative combustion control have been applied to a single-cylinder research engine and compared to conventional diesel combustion. By means of adequate measurement techniques and engine cycle simulation, the combustion processes were subjected to an exact thermodynamic analysis in terms of mixture formation, combustion and wall heat transfer and assessed for their potential relating to emissions, efficiency and load limits.

Through gasification and catalysis, biomass will be used to produce 75 million L year-1 of blo-ethanol. This study proposed three means of supplying biomass to the plant: 1) wood residue, 2) hybrid poplar (HP) afforestation plantations, and 3) HP afforestation plantations irrigated with municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE). To analyze the performance of the ethanol, the lifecycle analysis (LCA) model GHGenius was used. Both afforestation scenarios assumed a 10-year growth rotation, after which the biomass was harvested for feedstock. The project baseline considered how the transportation fuels would have been produced and used in light duty vehicles (LDV) with conventional gasoline and was compared to ethanol blended with gasoline in the amounts of 10% (E10) and 85% (E85). Lifecycle GHG emission reductions were 5.5, 5.9 and 7% for E10 produced from wood residue, afforestation plantations and afforestation plantations Irrigated with MWWE, respectively, and 67, 72 and 84% for E85 produced from forest residue, afforestation and afforestation irrigated with MWWE, respectively, when compared to conventional gasoline.

It is important to recognize that from April to September, on average, Canadian cities receive over 90% of solar radiation as in Miami, Florida. However, due to our geographic location and climatic conditions, the solar radiation is more abundant in the summer months and relatively low during the winter season when our energy demand for space heating is at a peak. Underground thermal energy storage (UTES) may be implemented in rocks or soil via a series of vertical borehole heat exchangers or in deep aquifers. This paper will review recent technological advances in the area of high temperature underground thermal energy storage in Canada, including the construction of the first community-scale solar heated, inter-seasonal thermal storage system in Canada. A vast amount of knowledge and experience relating to UTES has been documented. Engineers need to become familiar with this promising technology so that this tool could be made available to business stakeholders in the development of an efficient energy management system. A significant quantity of fossil fuel is required to meet our heating and cooling demand. We have an opportunity to capture the energy potential and utilize the stored energy to displace a large portion of the fuel used for space heating and cooling and make a significant contribution to our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals. © 2006 IEEE.","Borehole and aquifer thermal storage; Thermal energy storage","Aquifers; Climate change; Energy storage; Heat exchangers; Rocks; Soils; Solar radiation; Aquifer thermal storage; International Energy Agency (IEA); Thermal energy storage; Thermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549143831

Designing and instituting registries in the near term is important for several reasons: to provide incentives via credits for early reductions; to stay ahead of the technology curve, e.g. for advanced power generation technologies such as gasification with CO2 sequestration; and to ensure that future negotiated policies are able to take account of past emissions reductions. Emissions registries in the U.S. are initially being implemented at the state level. In order to properly inventory state-level emissions, as in California, the dynamics between regional power pools must be taken into account. A further issue that impacts emissions inventories from electricity production relates to the lifecycle emissions from resource extraction, fuel production, and fuel transportation. Power generation contributes to GHG generation not only via direct emissions from combustion, transmission, and distribution of electricity, but also upon the quantity of fuel consumed, which directly impacts upstream lifecycle emissions. The co-production of multiple products in power generation also presents an issue for GHG inventories. Certain advanced energy technology units will produce multiple products based on how the technology is used. The production of multiple outputs from one facility creates challenges for properly quantifying and categorizing emissions. Finally, the potential for carbon sequestration should be considered in GHG inventories for both advanced and existing technologies. Carbon sequestration may play an increasingly important part in carbon management and mitigation from power production. In anticipation of sequestration programs such as FutureGen, greater coal seam injections, and wider use of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery, inventory protocols should include provisions for the inventory of sequestered carbon, and for the monitoring, measurement and verification of sequestered carbon.",,"Advanced energy technology; CO2 sequestration; Lifecycle emissions; Air pollution; Electric power generation; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouses; Natural resources; Electricity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846207519

Simulation results illustrate that an open-loop system with optimal steady-state operating setpoints exhibits a slow transient power response when load increases. Feedback control is then explored to speed up the system response by controlling the flow rates of fuel and air supplies to the system. Model linearization, balanced truncation and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) approaches are used to derive the low-order observer-based controller. With the feedback controller developed, we show, through simulations, that the closed-loop system can have faster load following capability.

Many urban areas experience high levels of PM10 and compliance with the regulations for concentrations of PM10 and other pollutants must be achieved by 2013. This study uses urban airshed modelling techniques as a tool for assessing effects of pollution mitigation options. Masterton is a rural town with regular exceedences of the PM10 standard over winter, due largely to emissions from wood burning for home heating. A simulation of PM10 dispersion in Masterton for the winter months of 2003 has been carried out using TAPM (Version 3) on nested horizontal grids, down to 1 km spacing for meteorology and 0.5 km for pollution. Statistical measures of model performance show that the model performs well for both meteorology and pollution. The model links concentrations and emissions, showing an approximately linear relationship between them, although the number of exceedences is expected to decrease an approximate 15% reduction of domestic emissions has been achieved. The results demonstrate that modelling can be a useful tool for assessing emission reduction scenarios for NES compliance. Urban airshed modelling is a challenging task in coastal regions or complex terrain (typical of most NZ cities), particularly for regulatory purposes due to the requirement of simulation for extended periods at high temporal and spatial resolution. In addition, for small towns like Masterton, airshed modelling is a new technique. Therefore, this study represents a significant step forward for the application of airshed modelling in NZ and elsewhere.","Air pollution; Dispersion modelling; Home heating emissions; Masterton; National environmental standards; New Zealand; TAPM","air quality; atmospheric modeling; biomass burning; concentration (composition); conference proceeding; dispersion; emission; particulate matter; pollution control; rural atmosphere; winter; Australasia; Masterton; New Zealand; North Island; Wellington [North Island]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148942843

Previous findings show mycoheterotrophic plants exhibit a high level of specificity to their mycorrhizal fungi. In this study we explore the association of mycorrhizal fungi and Monotropa uniflora (Monotropoideae: Ericaceae) in eastern North America. We collected M. uniflora roots and nearby basidiomycete sporocarps from four sites within a 100 km2 area in eastern Massachusetts. We analyzed DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) from the fungal nuclear ribosomal gene to assess the genetic diversity of fungi associating with M. uniflora roots. In this analysis we included 20 ITS sequences from Russula sporocarps collected nearby, 44 sequences of Russula or Lactarius species from GenBank and 12 GenBank sequences of fungi isolated from M. uniflora roots in previous studies. We found that all 56 sampled M. uniflora mycorrhizal fungi were members of the Russulaceae, confirming previous research. The analysis showed that most of the diversity of mycorrhizal fungi spreads across the genus Russula. ITS sequences of the mycorrhizal fungi consisted of 20 different phylotypes: 18 of the genus Russula and two of Lactarius, based on GenBank searches. Of the sampled plants, 57% associated with only three of the 20 mycorrhizal fungi detected in roots, and of the 25 sporocarp phylotypes collected three, were associated with M. uniflora. Furthermore the results indicate that the number of different fungal phylotypes associating with M. uniflora of eastern North America is higher than that of western North America but patterns of fungal species abundance might be similar between mycorrhizae from the two locations. © 2006 by The Mycological Society of America.","Epiparasite; Internal transcribed spacer (ITS); Monotropoid; Mycoheterotroph; Mycorrhiza; Symbiosis","ribosomal spacer DNA; angiosperm; DNA fingerprinting; mycorrhiza; species diversity; Agaricales; article; classification; ecosystem; Ericaceae; genetics; isolation and purification; microbiology; mycorrhiza; physiology; symbiosis; tree; United States; Agaricales; DNA, Ribosomal Spacer; Ecosystem; Ericaceae; Massachusetts; Mycorrhizae; Symbiosis; Trees; Massachusetts; North America; United States; Basidiomycota; Ericaceae; Fungi; Lactarius; Monotropa uniflora; Monotropoideae; Russula; Russulaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751242269

The novel process requires two essential modifications, which are ozonation for enhancing the biological degradability of sludge organics and concentrating of solids in the digester through a solid/liquid separation for extension of SRT. These modifications resulted in high VSS degradation efficiency of ca. 88%, as much as 1.3 times of methane production and more than 70% reduction in dewatered sludge cake production. Based on the performance, its energy demands and contribution for minimisation of greenhouse gas emission was evaluated throughout an entire study of sludge treatment and disposal schemes in a municipality for 130,000 p.e. The analysis indicated that the novel process with power generation from biogas would lead to minimal greenhouse gas emission because the extra energy production from the scheme was expected to cover all of the energy demand for the plant operation, and the remarkable reduction in dewatered sludge cake volumes makes it possible to reduce N2O discharge and consumption of fossil fuel in the subsequent sludge incineration processes. © IWA Publishing 2006.","High-efficiency anaerobic digestion; Kyoto protocol; Sludge minimisation","Biodegradation; Combustion; Gas emissions; Ozonization; Phase separation; Sludge disposal; Waste treatment; Full-scale testing; Kyoto protocol; Partial ozonation; Sludge cake; Sludge minimisation; Sludge treatment; Anaerobic digestion; biogas; fossil fuel; nitrite; organic compound; Anaerobic digestion; Biodegradation; Combustion; Gas emissions; Ozonization; Phase separation; Sludge disposal; Waste treatment; sludge; waste treatment; article; biodegradability; concentration (parameters); controlled study; energy yield; greenhouse gas; incineration; intermethod comparison; liquid; ozonation; performance; separation technique; sludge dewatering; sludge treatment; solid; volumetry; waste disposal; waste water treatment plant; Algorithms; Anaerobiosis; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cities; Gases; Ozone; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645551387

It is common practice to characterize the coalbeds using two distinctive porosity systems: a well-defined and uniformly distributed network of natural fractures, and nearly impermeable and non-uniform coal matrix blocks. The blocks consist of microporous solids with large internal surface area and strong affinity for some naturally occurring chemical species such as methane and carbon dioxide. At high coalbed pressures, therefore, these species exist abundantly and/or could be stored in large quantities at a physically adsorbed liquidlike state. Much work has been carried out on adsorption capacity of various coals. Diffusive transport processes within the matrix blocks could be the rate limiting step for adsorption during gas injection and production operations. Identifying these processes and determining their contributions to overall (upscaled) mass transport is a complex and time consuming procedure. The paper presents numerical diffusion models in varying coal particles and investigates transport mechanisms. For this purpose, the coal particle is represented as a microporous solid penetrated by a network of larger interconnected macropores. The solid consists of pores of the order of a few molecular diameters and adsorbs the bulk of the gas. A simple relationship between the apparent and intrinsic (macropore and solid) Fickian diffusion coefficients is shown to exist in the case of single-component (methane) nonlinear Langmuir-type adsorption. Mass transport in the bidisperse coal particle is significantly influenced by the adsorption in microporous solid. The investigation is then extended to study concentration dependence of the microporous solid diffusion for binary (methane-CO2) mixtures. It is found that co-diffusion of the gas molecules enhances significantly, while counter-diffusion diminishes the mass transport in the solid in the presence of competitive sorption dynamics. The isotherm nonlinearity effects and the influence of lateral interactions among the adsorbed molecules in the solid phase are discussed. A sensitivity analysis is given to identify conditions that promote desorbed methane production from and adsorbed CO2 storage in the microporous solid. The work finds application in modeling CBM and ECBM processes.",,"Binary mixtures; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal deposits; Gas adsorption; Gasoline; Methane; Microporosity; Molecules; Pore structure; Sensitivity analysis; Adsorption capacities; Concentration dependence; Effective diffusion coefficients; Internal surface area; Langmuir-type adsorption; Production operations; Scale heterogeneities; Time-consuming procedure; Diffusion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085405743

It is mainly based on the theory of single-phase flow. Few publications consider two-phase flow. However, they were also generally reduced to single-phase inverse problems. During the last several years, authors have been developing an alternative trend in well testing. Its distinctive features are: creation of bi-directional two-phase flow in the near-wellbore region or forced creation of two- or three-phase fluid flow; interpretation of well test results based on 1D, 2D or 3D multiphase optimization problems. Obviously in this case well testing techniques are rather more complicated. They become science-intensive. On the other hand, they firstly extend the list of parameters and relations determined - those required for up-to-date 3D flow simulations. Added features include relative permeabilities for oil, gas and water, capillary pressures and full tensor permeability. Secondly, these parameters and relations characterize the effective (realistic) pore space. It is the effective, not absolute, pore space where the real reservoir flow processes take place. Turning to the effective pore space improves the degree of certainty in 3D modeling and enables proper use of well test results in the process of history matching 3D reservoir models. The developed approach displayed noticeable advantages when applied to carbonate formations. In this case it enables more reliable characterization, compared to laboratory core experiments, including determination of formation type (i.e. single- or dual-porosity) and parameters and relations required for 3D dual-porosity simulations. In the paper the authors present a review of results obtained up to date.

According to the International Energy Agency's predictions, the world's electricity demand will be doubled between now and 2030. During this period, nearly 1400 GW of new coal-fired power capacity will be required worldwide. With emission standards becoming more stringent, future coal-fired power plants will be expected to significantly reduce their emission intensity by utilizing advanced clean coal technologies. The new generation of clean coal power plants with CO2 capture, may include integrated energy conversion systems such as gasification with pre-combustion capture, ultra-supercritical steam boilers with post-combustion capture, and oxy-fuel combustion systems with integrated capture and compression. The capture component of these advance systems could be facilitated by a variety of technologies including membrane separation, absorption, adsorption and cryogenic separation technologies. Some of these technologies such as post-combustion with amine scrubbing would carry significant potential for adaptation in the existing fleet of coal-fired power plants through retrofit, while others such as oxy-fuel combustion and gasification could be effectively deployed in the new state-of-the-art green-field plants with near-zero emissions. Controlling the emission of toxic air pollutants such as mercury and other trace metals is one of several key challenges facing the large-scale deployment of advanced clean coal power plants in the next two decades. This is further compounded by the imposed timelines, set in the recent regulations and standards in U.S. and Canada. Currently, there are ongoing initiatives to demonstrate clean coal technologies for power generation in North America, Europe and other parts of the world by 2012 and beyond. However, any successful demonstration of clean coal technologies should also consider the control of primary air pollutants such as mercury. In this paper, we present an overview of mercury emissions from clean coal power plants with CO2 capture, possible pathways for mercury species in gasification, oxy-coal combustion and post-combustion capture plants, and potential control technologies for reducing mercury emissions from these plants. The CANMET' s oxy-fuel combustion group has been actively pursuing the development of new mercury control technologies for oxy-coal combustion processes in recent years. The focus of this work is on low rank coals, mainly, sub-bituminous and lignite coals.

The study is centred on the most frequently visited MOZAIC airports, i.e. Frankfurt (Germany), Paris (France), New York (USA) and the cluster of Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka (Japan). The analysis focuses on the vertical integration of ozone from the ground to the dynamical tropopause and the vertical integration of stratospheric-origin ozone throughout the troposphere. The characteristics of the MOZAIC profiles: frequency of flights, accuracy, precision, and depth of the troposphere observed, are presented. The climatological analysis shows that the Tropospheric Ozone Column (TOC) seasonal cycle ranges from a wintertime minimum at all four stations to a spring-summer maximum in Frankfurt, Paris, and New York. Over Japan, the maximum occurs in spring presumably because of the earlier springtime sun. The incursion of monsoon air masses into the boundary layer and into the mid troposphere then steeply diminishes the summertime value. Boundary layer contributions to the TOC are 10% higher in New York than in Frankfurt and Paris during spring and summer, and are 10% higher in Japan than in New York, Frankfurt and Paris during autumn and early spring. Local and remote anthropogenic emissions, and biomass burning over upstream regions of Asia may be responsible for the larger low- and mid-tropospheric contributions to the tropospheric ozone column over Japan throughout the year except during the summer-monsoon season. A simple Lagrangian analysis has shown that a minimum of 10% of the TOC is of stratospheric-origin throughout the year. Investigation of the short-term trends of the TOC over the period 1995-2001 shows a linear increase 0.7%/year in Frankfurt, 0.8%/year in Japan, 1.1%/year in New York and 1.6%/year in Paris for the reduced 1995-1999 period. Dominant ingredients of these positive short-term trends are the continuous increase of wintertime tropospheric ozone columns from 1996 to 1999 and the positive contributions of the mid troposphere whatever the season. © Author(s) 2006.

Less is known about the modification of this association by factors measured at the individual level. The authors examined this question in a case-crossover study of 20 US cities. Mortality events (1.9 million) were obtained for nonaccidental, respiratory, heart disease, and stroke mortality between 1989 and 2000. PM10 concentrations were obtained from the US Environmental Protection Agency. The authors examined the modification of the PM10-mortality association by sociodemographics, location of death, season, and secondary diagnoses. They found different patterns of PM10-mortality associations by gender and age but no differences by race. The level of education was inversely related to the risk of mortality associated with PM10. PM10-related, out-of-hospital deaths were more likely than were in-hospital deaths, as were those occurring during spring/fall versus summer/winter. A secondary diagnosis of diabetes modified the effect of PM10 for respiratory and stroke mortality. Pneumonia was a positive effect modifier for deaths from all causes and stroke, while secondary stroke modified the effects for all-cause and respiratory deaths. The findings suggest that more attention must be paid to population characteristics to identify greater likelihood of exposures and susceptibility and, as a result, to improve policy making for air pollution standards.

The simulation results show the varying trends of natural ventilation potential with increased building scale ratio of LAV and HAV. The comparison of the predicted energy consumptions for twenty buildings discloses the most energy-efficient building scales for rectangular-shape buildings in both hot and mild climates with and without natural ventilation. The study indicates that natural ventilation is more effective in mild climates than in hot climates, which may save cooling energy by 50% and vent fan energy by 70%. The paper analyzes the most suitable seasons for natural ventilation in Miami and Los Angeles.

It was found from phase behavior studies that for a given synthetic surfactant and crude oil containing naphthenic acids, optimal salinity depends only on the ratio of the moles of soap formed from the acids to the moles of synthetic surfactant present. Adsorption of anionic surfactants on carbonate surfaces is reduced substantially by sodium carbonate but not by sodium hydroxide. The magnitude of the reduction with sodium carbonate decreases with increasing salinity. Particular attention was given to a surfactant blend of a propoxylated sulfate having a slightly branched C16-17 hydrocarbon chain and an internal olefin sulfonate. In contrast to alkyl/aryl sulfonates previously considered for EOR, alkaline solutions of this blend containing neither alcohol nor oil were single-phase micellar solutions at all salinities up to and even exceeding optimal salinity with representative oils. Phase behavior with a West Texas crude oil at ambient temperature in the absence of alcohol was unusual in that colloidal material, perhaps another microemulsion having a higher soap content, was dispersed in the lower phase microemulsion. Low interfacial tensions existed with the excess oil phase only when this material was present in sufficient amount in the spinning drop device. Overall solubilization of oil and brine for this system was high, leading to low interfacial tensions over a wide salinity range and to excellent oil recovery in both dolomite and silica sand packs. These experiments were performed with surfactant concentrations as low as 0.2 wt%. It was necessary that sufficient polymer be present to provide adequate mobility control and that salinity be below the value at which phase separation occurred in the polymer/surfactant solution. A one-dimensional simulator was developed to model the process. By calculating transport of soap formed from the crude oil and injected surfactant separately, it showed that a gradient in local soap-to surfactant ratio develops during the process. This gradient increases robustness of the process in a manner similar to that of a salinity gradient in a conventional surfactant process. Predictions of the simulator were in excellent agreement with the sand pack results. Copyright 2006.

Unlike conventional SI engines, lean burn engines are no longer operating in a narrow band around stoichiometry resulting in a very challenging air-fuel ratio tracking problem. An approach to combine an input shaping method together with a linear parameter varying (LPV) feedback controller is proposed to solve the transient air-fuel ratio tracking problem. In [1], a feedback LPV air-fuel ratio controller has been designed to regulate the air-fuel ratio at steady state engine operating conditions, reduce the variability of the closed-loop system, reject disturbances and guarantee robustness and stability. In this paper, an input shaping method is proposed to reduce the cost of feedback, and thereby enhance the air-fuel ratio tracking performance during engine transient operations. The prefilter is designed based on the closed-loop dynamics resulting from the LPV design. A systematic input shaping prefilter design process is developed. The designed prefilter successfully extends the closed-loop air-fuel ratio tracking bandwidth. Simulation results are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the input shaping prefilter. Moreover, the designed prefilter is structurally simple and computationally efficient. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Air-fuel ratio control; Emission regulations; Shaping prefilter; Closed loop systems; Computational efficiency; Computer simulation; Feedback control; Fuel economy; Laws and legislation; Robustness (control systems); Stoichiometry; Control theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047226572

Continuous and increasing use of petroleum will intensify local air pollution and magnify the global warming problems caused by CO2. In a particular case, such as the emission of pollutants in the closed environments of underground mines, biodiesel fuel has the potential to reduce the level of pollutants and probable carcinogens. As a kind of alternative renewable biofuels, development of biodiesel is helpful to realize sustainable development of human being. A potential diesel oil substitute is biodiesel, which is produced by tranesterifieation of reacting a vegetable oil or animal fat with an alcohol such as methanol with catalyst. Diesel engines operated on bio-diesel have lower emissions of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, particulate matter, and air toxics than those when operated on petroleum-based diesel fuel. Usually, a strong base, acid and enzyme such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, sulfuric acid and lipase are used as catalyst. In addition, supercritical fluid technology is also used in production of biodiesel. In our research, production of biodiesel from peanut oil with alkali catalyst by transesterification was discussed, and effects of operational parameters. In our experiment, the peanut oil was purchased from Lu-hua Co.Lit. China. KOH and methanol were purchased from Beijing Chemical Agents Company in China. Transesterification reaction was carried out in flask. The peanut oil reacted with methanol with KOH catalyst at certain temperature. The effects of operation conditions such as molar ratio of peanut oil to methanol, amount of catalyst and temperature on biodiesel were discussed. Biodiesel conversion rate and components were measured by GC-MS. The results showed as follows: The effects of molar ratio of peanut oil to methanol on conversion rate of biodiesel were discussed, As reaction time increased, conversion rate increased using different molar ratio of peanut oil to methanol. Before 20 min, conversion rate increased fast. After that, conversion rate became stable with increasing reaction time. Also, it has been found that conversion rate was higher than that using other molar ratios of peanut oil to methanol when molar ratio of peanut oil to methanol was 6:1. Therefore, an appropriate molar ratio of peanut oil to methanol was 6:1, and reaction time was 20 min. The effects of NaOH amount on conversion rate of biodiesel were invsetigated, the results made it clear that conversion rate increased gradually with increasing NaOH amount. Conversion rate reached the highest when NaOH amount was 1%. After that, conversion rate decreased as NaOH amount enhanced. When NaOH amount was lower, Transesterification reaction can not been carried out totally due to shortage of catalyst. However, when NaOH amount was higher, too much NaOH amount made the viscidity of reaction solution increased. So, the optimal NaOH amount was 1%. In the case of the effects of reaction temperature on conversion rate of biodiesel, it has been found that conversion rate of biodiesel increased when reaction temperature increased. The reason was that lower reaction temperature was not helpful to finish transesterification reaction of biodiesel production, but higher reaction temperature was benefit to transesterification reaction. When reaction temperature was larger than 45°C, conversion rate reached more than 82%. Considering boiling point of methanol and production cost, 45°C was chosen as an appropriate reaction temperature. By analyzing the components of biodiesel by GC-MS analysis, it was found that biodiesel product was consisted of various kinds of fatty acid methyl esters by GC-MS analysis, among which relative contents of palmitic acid methyl esters and linolenic acid methyl esters were higher. In addition, glycerol was obtained as a by-product after transesterification. Compared with diesel oil, main properties of biodiesel are shown to be well confirmed to that of No. 0 mineral diesel oil.","Biodiesel; Fatty acid methyl esters; Peanut oil; Transesterification","Acids; Air engines; Air quality; Alkalinity; Arsenic; Boiling point; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Crude petroleum; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Diesel locomotives; Effluent treatment; Esterification; Esters; Fatty acids; Gas turbines; Global warming; Glycerol; Hydrocarbons; Industrial waste treatment; Leakage (fluid); Lubricating oils; Lutetium; Methanol; Oil well production; Oils and fats; Organic compounds; Particulate emissions; Petroleum refineries; Planning; Potassium; Potassium hydroxide; Psychophysiology; Rate constants; Silica; Silicate minerals; Sodium; Strategic planning; Sulfuric acid; Supercritical fluids; Synthetic fuels; Transesterification; Vegetable oils; Well stimulation; Air toxics; Alkali catalysts; Animal fats; Beijing; Biodiesel fuels; Biodiesel productions; Chemical agents; Closed environments; Conversion rates; Crude oil prices; Diesel oils; Environmental concerns; Fatty acid methyl esters; Global warming problems; Human beings; KOH catalysts; Limited resources; Linolenic acids; Local air pollutions; Lower reaction temperatures; Methyl esters; Molar ratios; Ms analyses; Operation conditions; Operational parameters; Palmitic acid methyl esters; Particulate matters; Peanut oil; Production costs; Reaction solutions; Reaction temperatures; Reaction times; Renewable biofuels; Supercritical fluid technologies; Transesterification reactions; Unburned hydrocarbons; Underground mines; Biodiesel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57049188197

We have extended the solid-state metathesis (SSM) method by choosing an organic compound, melamine, and oxides as precursors, which allows us to develop a relatively general and facile route to nitrides. Whereby, eight technologically important nitrides including hexagonal GaN and cubic TiN were synthesized in sealed ampoules. These reactions are dynamically facilitated by the formation of numerous interfaces between finely-divided oxide grains and gas phases with high reactivity in an intermediate stage under heating temperatures.

The combination effects of carbon and Ti doping on structure, microstructure, irreversibility field (Hirr), and critical current density (Jc) of Mg B2 have been investigated. It is found that doping Ti in Mg B2 does not reduce the solubility of carbon in Mg B2, but, on the contrary, it eliminates the porosity present in the carbon-doped Mg B2, resulting in an improved intergrain connectivity. As a result, Jc and Hirr of Mg B2 have been significantly improved, sharply contrasted to the situation of C-only-doped or Ti-only-doped Mg B2 bulks.

This paper uses a building energy simulation program and a computational fluid dynamics program to investigate the influence of building scales on building cooling energy consumption with and without natural ventilation. The study examines the energy performance of buildings with different L/W and H/W ratios in both Miami, FL and Los Angeles, CA. The simulation results show the varying trends of natural ventilation potential with increased building scale ratio of L/W and H/W. The comparison of the predicted energy consumptions for twenty buildings discloses the most energy-efficient building scales for rectangular-shape buildings in both hot and mild climates with and without natural ventilation. The study indicates that natural ventilation is more effective in mild climates than in hot climates, which may save cooling energy by 50% and vent fan energy by 70%. The paper analyzes the most suitable seasons for natural ventilation in Miami and Los Angeles. Further simulations indicate that extra cooling benefits associated with more natural ventilation cannot compensate additional heat gains through larger windows.

The first step decides the general color change timing of the maple tree based on its local environment. Then we make further adjustments to the timing determined in the last step taking into account the influence of climate in the specific case. In the last step, the texture maps of leaves are generated based on the pigment information.

To achieve production without human intervention, machines require artificial receptors. Data gathering for processing and analysis of signals, together with determination of feedback reactions can be achieved by a suitable decision maker unit. A sensed value suited to this so-called intelligent sensing process would be the acoustic emission signal. In the case of intelligent cutting tools this would require miniature highly sensitive sensors integrated into the cutting tool body. Part I of this paper deals with the possibility of practical usage of the piezoelectric properties of copolymer foils for the acoustic emission sensor as a transducer of a mechanical surface wave into electrical signal. Part II of the paper deals with the most fundamental requirement for monitoring of cutting conditions during machining, i.e. excellent processing of measured data. Data obtained from machining process obtained by means of acoustic emission sensors, as discussed in the first part of this article, have high-frequency and continuous character of a white noise. These data are very difficult to process. New apparatus for transformation of acoustic emission into audible sound in the workplace is presented. The first stage of processing is by listening to transformed data it is subjectively possible to recognize differences in audible spectrum, corresponding to different states of the cutting tool. The second step is visualization of the differences via the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in the spectrum graphic chart.","AE sensor; Audible sound; Copolymer foil; Cutting process; Piezoelectric transducer; Surface roughness; Tool wear","Acoustic emissions; Condition monitoring; Data acquisition; Fast Fourier transforms; Piezoelectric transducers; Sensors; Surface roughness; Wear of materials; Audible sound; Copolymer foils; Cutting process; Tool wear; Cutting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845927679

Although passenger tires last far longer today than they did 30 years ago, most are replaced every 3 to 5 years because of wear. A total of about 200 million replacement passenger tires are purchased in the United States annually. Each time they replace their tires, motorists spend several hundred dollars and must choose among tires varying in price, style, and many aspects of performance. The tires they do buy will affect not only the handling, traction, ride comfort, and appearance of their vehicles but also fuel economy. Tires affect vehicle fuel economy mainly through rolling resistance. As a tire rolls under the vehicle's weight, its shape changes repeatedly as it experiences recurring cycles of deformation and recovery. In the process, mechanical energy otherwise available to turn the wheels is converted into heat and dissipated from the tire. More fuel must be expended to replace this lost energy. Combinations of differences in tire dimensions, design, materials, and construction features will cause tires to differ in rolling resistance as well as in many other attributes such as traction, handling, noise, wear resistance, and appearance. Once they are placed in service, tires must be properly maintained to perform as intended with respect to all attributes. The maintenance of proper inflation pressure is especially important. The collective outcomes of the choices consumers make when they buy tires are matters of public interest. The 220 million passenger cars and light trucks in the United States consume about 130 billion gallons of motor fuel annually. Finding ways to reduce this energy consumption is a national goal for reasons ranging from ensuring economic and national security to improving local air quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Maximizing the wear life of tires is also important from the public standpoint of controlling the population of scrap tires that can burden landfills and recycling programs. While the handling, traction, and other operating characteristics of tires are of particular interest to tire buyers, they are also matters of broader public interest inasmuch as they may influence the safety performance of vehicles on the nation's highways. This study was conducted at the request of Congress with funding from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). It examines the rolling resistance characteristics of passenger tires sold for replacement and how differences in rolling resistance relate to other tire attributes. Specifically, Congress asked the National Research Council (NRC) to assess the feasibility of reducing rolling resistance in replacement tires and the effects of doing so on vehicle fuel consumption, tire wear life and scrap tire generation, and tire operating performance as it relates to motor vehicle safety. Congress asked that the assessment include estimates of the effects of reductions in rolling resistance on consumer spending on fuel and tire replacement. To conduct the study, the Transportation Research Board, under the auspices of NRC, assembled a committee of experts in tire engineering and manufacturing, mechanical and materials engineering, and statistics and economics. The study committee reviewed the technical literature and analyzed data on passenger tire rolling resistance and other characteristics. Many aspects of tire design, construction, and manufacturing are proprietary, which limits the availability of quantitative information, particularly on the effects of specific changes in tire design and construction to reduce rolling resistance. Nevertheless, enough quantitative and technical information exists in the public domain to assess and reach some general conclusions about the feasibility of reducing rolling resistance in replacement tires and the implications for other tire attributes. Effects on consumer spending on fuel and tire replacement can also be approximated. The study findings and conclusions are summarized below. Taken together, they persuade the committee that the influence of passenger tires on vehicle fuel consumption warrants greater attention by government, industry, and consumers. A recommendation for congressional action is offered in light of this conclusion.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747496681

Now, after more than a dozen years in operation, the success of the SO2 program is well-established. It has achieved mandated SO2 reductions faster, and at lower cost, than would have been possible using command-and-control regulation. Under the two-phase program, now in Phase II, EPA established a nationwide cap of 8.9 million ton/yr of SO2 emissions for all US coal-fired power plants (50% of 1980 levels), and then distributed annual allocations - each representing the right to emit 1 ton/yr of SO2 - to regulated facilities on a prorated basis. By allowing operators to meet their site-specific requirements by switching to lower-sulfur coal or natural gas, installing wet scrubbers, or buying allowances from others that were able to over-reduce their SO2 emissions, the program gives enormous flexibility to choose the most cost-effective and technically feasible option.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745953586
