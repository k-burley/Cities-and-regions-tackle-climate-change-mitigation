These studies provide the basis for much of the following description of major Pleistocene-Holocene environmental changes in the region. Studies of Tertiary geography, climate, and biota (e.g., Atamuradov 1994:52-61; Kurbanov 1994:124-27) indicate that the climate became progressively more continental and the flora more xerophytic through the Pliocene (the final epoch of the Tertiary). There is fossil evidence that broadleaf trees such as oak and liquidambar were components of mesophytic forests in the Kopetdag mountains, but they became extinct as the trend toward a more continental climate, coupled with tectonic uplift, continued through the Quaternary. This trend caused the vegetation to become differentiated into lowland desert forms and more mesic communities in the mountains and along the main river valleys. By the end of the Pliocene tectonic activity had created the major mountain ranges and lowlands, including the Aral and Caspian Sea basins and the Sarykamysh depression; the ancestral (proto-) Syrdarya, Zeravshan, Amudarya, Uzboi, Murghab, Tedzhen, Atrek, and Gorgan river systems were in existence; and the lowlands had become generally desertic (Atamuradov 1994:56-60; Boomer et al. 2000:1260-66). Then, during the Pleistocene and Holocene, the climate, drainage pattern, and plant and animal communities underwent a series of further changes that led to the present-day configuration and ecology of the region. © 2010 University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

Hayes, senior fellow, world wildlife fund, before the senate committee on foreign relations, subcommittee on international development and foreign assistance, economic affairs and international environmental protection*",2010,"Deforestation and Climate Change",,,,"105","118",,,,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892135120&partnerID=40&md5=5733e3d6a03499d8d279ecc0b7d5a9d7",,"","WWF is encouraged by the promising first steps that the internationalcommunity is taking to address global deforestation and degradation as part ofthe United Nations' framework convention on climate change, as evidenced inthe recent Conference of the Parties in Bali, Indonesia, and in discussionsleading towards Copenhagen, when a new treaty is expected to be completed.WWF also is encouraged that S. 2191, America's Climate Security Act,introduced by Senators Lieberman and Warner, which would establish a U.S.-based program to constrain greenhouse gas emissions, also includes aninternational forestry title which recognizes that the U.S. must play an activerole in ""reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation"" or ""REDD,""working in tandem with affected nations and the entire internationalcommunity.The attention on deforestation is both appropriate and necessary, given thefact that the on-going loss of forestry resources accounts for approximately20% of all greenhouse gas emissions, world-wide. Simply put, we cannotmake progress in battling climate change unless we reduce the alarming rate ofdeforestation that is occurring on an on-going basis in a number of developingnations.Unlike conventional sources of greenhouse emissions, however,deforestation and forest degradation present multi-faceted challenges that areparticularly difficult to tackle. Sustainable progress will only be made byaddressing the complex root causes of deforestation and forest degradation.This will require the cooperation of the governments who are losing theirforestry resources; the cooperation of the U.S. and other developed nationswhose trade practices are influencing how forestry resources are being used(and/or abused); and, importantly, the active participation of indigenouspeople and others who are most impacted by land use choices made in theirhome lands.WWF believes that international climate change discussions and U.S.legislation should focus, first, on promoting economic models that address theroot causes of deforestation and degradation and which involve thecoordinated effort of the international community. Economic initiatives thatencourage trade in sustainable forestry resources and products, and whichpenalize forest degradation and the loss of valuable forest resources, forexample, must be actively promoted. The development of international carbonmarkets that will recognize and reward the financial value of maintainingtropical forests and reducing rates of deforestation also should be the subjectof active consideration. To lay the groundwork for developing such a market, asignificant investment must be made in building local capacity to measure andmonitor the carbon stocks in developing countries' forestry resources.In this regard, WWF supports the Lieberman-Warner bill's establishmentof an Emission Allowance Account ""for use in carrying out forest carbonactivities in countries other than the United States."" Such an allocation wouldgenerate funding needed to help local citizens and institutions develop andproliferate the technologies and methodologies that will reliably measure andtrack the carbon content of forests and forest products, and to undertake thetraining needed to generate and validate the data used for this purpose. Asdiscussed further below, these are essential prerequisites of any effort toestablish a credible and viable carbon market in those countries.As a corollary, WWF also supports the Lieberman-Warner bill's generalexpression of interest in developing and promoting a carbon market that couldgenerate financial support for protecting forests. WWF believes that the U.S.should proceed deliberately in this area, however, in close cooperation withthe international community. A carbon market that effectively generatesfinancial incentives to reduce tropical deforestation should not be presumed tooperate in the same way as today's voluntary market for carbon offsets fromforests, or the Kyoto Protocol's project-based Clean Development Mechanism.A different approach will be needed if credit is to be given to avoidingdeforestation and to the on-going conservation of forestry resources.A deliberate approach also is needed due to the significant concerns thathave been raised about the environmental integrity of some offset projects thathave been developed under existing frameworks. Similar concerns will applyto forest-based credits. Indeed, forestry credits are likely to generate specialscrutiny, given the large number of credits that potentially could be generatedfrom avoided deforestation projects and the special challenges of quantifyingand verifying emissions reductions from improved forestry practices,particularly with regard to ""leakage,"" ""permanence"" and ""additionality,"" asdiscussed below. In addition, a carbon market that credits forestry-based""offsets"" must not enable industrialized nations to avoid investments in theirown emissions reductions.Despite these challenges, WWF is optimistic that the U.S., working withthe international community, can identify and implement a comprehensiveprogram that tackles the root causes of deforestation. This effort can and mustinclude the development of financial mechanisms that will sustainably protectforestry resources and complement commitments by developed countries toreduce their greenhouse gas emissions. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Past OECD analysis on policies supporting the production and use of liquid biofuels for transport (OECD, 2008) has shown that other forms of bioenergy, such as bioheat, biopower and biogas, could represent economically more viable and environmentally more efficient ways to reduce GHG emissions and fossil fuel use, two of the high-ranking objectives behind most bioenergy support policies. The present report aims to complement this first study in explicitly looking at those forms of bioenergy and the policies supporting them.Bioenergy represents a rather heterogeneous portfolio of different biomass feedstocks and conversion technologies. While particularly firstgeneration liquid biofuels are dominated by feedstocks originating from agricultural products, such as grains, sugar crops and oilseeds, nonagricultural feedstocks (such as forest products and residues, industrial and municipal wastes) and, to a lesser extent, agricultural residues and wastes, dominate in the generation of bioheat and biopower, resulting in substantially less competition with the production of food and animal feed. Commercialised biomass crops, which could compete with land use for food production, are being developed, but today only play a minor role. Main technologies to convert biomass to heat and/or electrical power include the direct combustion (partly as co-firing with fossil fuels), the gasification and the anaerobic digestion producing biogas. Combined heat and power generation plants allow improving the energy efficiency with the use of the remaining heat after power generation for space heating or in industrial applications.Being part of the renewable energy portfolio, heat and power generation from biomass benefits from public support measures in many countries. The objectives of such support are many fold and in particular include the security of energy supply, environmental improvements, rural development, and the generation of supplementary outlets for agricultural products. While a number of countries have established national or regional targets for renewable energy, only a few have defined specific targets for bioheat and/or biopower, including Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Romania and the US. The policy measures applied most commonly include guaranteed prices for renewable electricity or gas fed into the grid, and investment subsidies. The application of these measures differs across countries, however, and is complemented by a large set of other support measures.To what degree does the environmental performance of the different bioenergy chains meet the objectives behind the political support? While many other factors are relevant in this context, the present study focuses on two major variables: greenhouse gas (GHG) savings and energy balances. A large number of studies providing life-cycle analyses (LCAs) for bioheat, biopower and biogas chains were evaluated for this study, and the results indicate that while there is substantial variation in the GHG and energy balances, indeed most of these chains show important savings of GHG emissions when compared to the main fossil alternatives. This is particularly true for electricity production chains, where GHG savings generally range between 63% and 99% when compared to the use of coal, and between 37% and 98% when compared to the use of natural gas. While still significant, savings were found to be smaller for heat applications, though this may reflect on the lower efficiency associated with smaller district, space heating and domestic heating systems. In either case, GHG savings for most chains seem to be significantly higher than for liquid biofuel chains.While the average energy efficiency for most biopower chains ranges between 0.3 and 0.8 MJin per MJout, with a few studies indicating values above 1 MJin per MJout, this represents significant fossil energy savings when compared to efficiencies of 2.1 MJin per MJout for natural gas, and 2.8 MJin per MJout for coal fired power plants. Similar savings in fossil energy use are found for a range of bioheat chains when compared to natural gas and fuel oil as feedstocks.Data on the production of bioheat, biopower and biogas, and particularly on biomass use, is scarce, but available data provide a couple of general trends. First, on a global level, some 10% of total primary energy demand is met by energy from biomass, but almost two-thirds of this come from nonagricultural solid biomass outside the OECD area. While detailed data are lacking it can be assumed that much of this is traditional biomass, such as firewood used in developing countries for cooking and heating. Within the OECD, too, the vast majority of bioenergy is based on forest products and residues. Agricultural biomass - crops, residues and wastes - only plays a relatively small role, particularly after deduction of first generation liquid biofuels. Second, modern bioenergy has been gaining importance over the past two decades, and particularly since the beginning of the century. This is mainly driven by the rapid development of liquid biofuels for transport, but biogas - mainly landfill and sludge gases, to a lesser extent gas from other (mainly agricultural) biomass - shows a clear upward trend as well. Shares of agricultural biogas in total primary energy supply of at least 0.1% are largely limited to a few countries today, including Germany, Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as well as, outside the OECD, China. Third, on an aggregate level, implications of increased production and use of bioheat, biopower and biogas for agricultural markets are likely to be small for the time being. Exceptions at a local or national level could include the increasing area used for biogas substrate production in Germany, potentially competing with the production of food and feed, and a few other countries where the use of sugar cane bagasse or straw as bioenergy feedstock might have the opposite effect of raising incentives for commodity production. A stronger focus on agricultural biomass crops in the development of bioheat and biopower could, however, result in potentially more significant implications. It has been shown in earlier OECD studies that increased production of first-generation liquid biofuels results in higher crop prices. The growth of growing bioheat and biopower markets may have a similar, although probably less pronounced, effect through increased competition for agricultural land and other resources, although this could not be analyzed quantitatively in the present study due to data limitations. Policies supporting bioenergy chains should therefore ensure that they do not compromise the ability of the agricultural sector to provide food and feed commodities in a sustainable manner. © OECD 2010.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957761205

Because they are home to major infrastructure and highly concentrated populations, cities are also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms. At the same time, better urban planning and policies can reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions and improve the resilience of urban infrastructure to climate change, thus shaping future trends. This book shows how city and metropolitan regional governments working in tandem with national governments can change the way we think about responding to climate change. The chapters analyse: trends in urbanisation, economic growth, energy use and climate change; the economic benefits of climate action; the role of urban policies in reducing energy demand, improving resilience to climate change and complementing global climate policies; frameworks for multilevel governance of climate change including engagement with relevant stakeholders; and the contribution of cities to ""green growth"", including the ""greening"" of fiscal policies, innovation and jobs. The book also explores policy tools and best practices from both OECD and some non-member countries. Cities and Climate Change reveals the importance of addressing climate change across all levels of government. Local involvement through ""climate-conscious"" urban planning and management can help achieve national climate goals and minimise tradeoffs between environmental and economic priorities at local levels. The book will be relevant to policy makers, researchers, and others with an interest in learning more about urbanisation and climate change policy. © OECD 2010.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957739581

The need for policies that promote the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services is more important than ever. Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) is a direct and flexible incentive-based mechanism under which the user or beneficiary of an ecosystem service makes a direct payment to an individual or community whose land use decisions have an impact on the ecosystem service provision. Interest in PES has been increasing rapidly over the past decade: PES are proliferating worldwide and there are already more than 300 programmes in place today at national, regional and local levels. Drawing on the literature concerning effective PES and on more than 30 case studies from both developed and developing countries, this book aims to identify good practice in the design and implementation of PES programmes so as to enhance their environmental and cost effectiveness. It addresses the following questions: Why are PES useful and how do they work? How can they be made most effective environmentally and how can their cost-effectiveness be maximised? What are the different potential sources of finance for PES programmes, and how can they be secured? and What are the lessons learned from existing PES programmes and insights for future programmes, including international PES? © OECD 2010.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957732794

This proposal shows that the designation of this Emission Control Area is supported by a demonstrated need to prevent, reduce and control emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, and particulate matter from ships. Moreover, adoption of the proposed Emission Control Area will result in significant reductions in ambient levels of air pollution in the United States and Canada, which will achieve substantial benefits to human health and the environment. The United States and Canada invite the Committee to review this proposal at this session with a view toward the adoption by the Parties to MARPOL Annex VI, at MEPC 60, of amendments to Regulations 13.6 and 14.3 designating a new Emission Control Area. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Non-attainment findings are scheduled for release in 2010. State environmental protection agencies in states with non-attainment areas are required to draft State Implementation Plans (SIP) detailing measures to reduce regional PM2.5 levels by reducing PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursor emissions. This paper shows how important it is for SIP authors to consider the energy requirements of control technologies. Regulations that require the operation of control technologies to reduce PM2.5 emissions will cause increased emissions where the electricity that powers those control devices is generated. This resulting increase in power plant emissions may be greater or more harmful than the avoided PM2.5 emissions. The cotton ginning industry was modeled. Cyclones are the most common emissions control device used by agricultural processing facilities. Potential PM2.5 emissions reductions realized by adding a second set of cyclones to cotton gins were estimated for each cotton growing region. Increases in energy consumption were calculated based on cyclone air pressure drop. Additional energy required was translated into increased emissions using published emission factors and state emissions inventories. Reductions in gin emissions were compared to increases in emissions at the power plant. Because of the electrical energy required, reducing one unit of agricultural PM2.5 emissions at a cotton gin may result in emitting 0.11 to 2.67 units of direct PM2.5, 1.39 to 69.1 units of PM2.5 precursors, 1.70 to 76.8 units of criteria pollutants, and 692 to 15,400 units of greenhouse gasses at the point where electricity is produced. If regulations designed to reduce rural PM2.5 emissions increase electrical power consumption, the unintended net effect may be more emissions, increased environmental damage and a greater risk to public health.","Abatement; Agricultural dust; Air quality; Emissions control; Fine particulate; Regulatory compliance","Agricultural engineering; Agricultural machinery; Air quality; Atmospheric pressure; Control; Cotton; Cultivation; Dust; Dust abatement; Energy utilization; Engineers; Environmental Protection Agency; Health risks; Internet protocols; Power plants; Quality control; Regulatory compliance; Storms; Sustainable development; Abatement; Agricultural dust; Control device; Control technologies; Cotton gin; Cotton ginning; Dust emission; Electrical energy; Electrical power consumption; Emission factors; Emissions control; Emissions inventory; Emissions reduction; Energy consumption; Energy requirements; Environmental costs; Environmental damage; Fine particulates; Growing regions; National Ambient Air Quality Standards; Net effect; Non-attainment; Power-plant emissions; Processing facilities; Public health; State Implementation Plans; US Environmental Protection Agency; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78649688891
