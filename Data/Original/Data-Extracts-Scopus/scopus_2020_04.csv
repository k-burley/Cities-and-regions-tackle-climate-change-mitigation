When the auroral electrojet index increased significantly, the energetic electron precipitation from the Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector was enhanced by several multiples of 10 for the 55°-70° geomagnetic latitude band. The temperatures measured by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument increased immediately in the mesopause region, together with a descent of the mesopause of about 0.5-2 km. Due to the depth that the precipitation can affect, we conclude that the mesopause is mainly influenced by electrons in the energy range 30-100 keV. The maximum temperature increment at 95 km can reach 4 K and the delay of the response can be up to 1 day. In general, we find that the temperatures significantly respond to the electron precipitation at as low as 93 km, within the mesopause region in most of a year. © 2020.

However, air pollutant concentration focused efforts were considered separately from human exposure risk. And this might result in a misunderstanding that reducing exposure risk can only rely on the national level measures of air pollutant control. This study integrates the first Chinese survey of human activity patterns and the spatially continuous high-resolution PM2.5 concentration maps to reveal the spatial and temporal variations of China's air pollution exposure risk from 2013 to 2017. More importantly, the effects on risk reduction from multi-scale and multi-object perspectives (reductions of ambient PM2.5 concentrations by national or provincial measures and changes of individual behavior patterns by personal efforts) are deeply investigated. Results show that the reductions of PM2.5 concentration and associated reductions of exposure risk from 2013 to 2017 were 40% and 35.7%, respectively. They also showed that both the reduction of PM2.5 concentrations and change of personal behavior patterns were effective for risk reduction when China's total PM2.5 exposure risk was higher than 1.58. However, only individual behavior changes contributed to risk reduction for scenarios with state-level risk value below 1.58. For regional strategies, threshold values for PM2.5 exposure risk control differentiating national measures or personal efforts were spatially and temporally dependent. The role of personal behavior changes on PM2.5 exposure risk reduction was growing in these five years with concentration rapidly decreasing regions. The findings suggest that people-centered air pollution exposure risk prevention not only depends on government management for air pollution control, but also on individual changes of activity patterns. Efforts from the state and individuals are both essential for reducing air pollution exposure risk in China, especially growing individual efforts are needed in regions with the decreasing air pollutant concentrations in the coming future. Moreover, this study mainly discussed the PM2.5 exposure risk from the macroscopic perspective, the research at the microcosmic perspective is also needed in the further study. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollution; Exposure factors; Exposure risk; Individual exposure","Air pollution; Behavioral research; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Water pollution control; Air pollutant concentrations; Air pollution exposures; Exposure factors; Government management; Human activity patterns; Human exposure risks; Individual exposures; Spatial and temporal variation; Air pollution control; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); human activity; particulate matter; pollutant; pollution control; pollution exposure; adult; air pollutant; air pollution control; article; behavior change; China; controlled study; government; human; risk reduction; air pollution; China; environmental exposure; longitudinal study; particulate matter; risk reduction; toxicity; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Particulate Matter; Risk Reduction Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078842273

To date, however, research has not looked empirically at how “everyday” urban politics shape the multi-scalar political constraints that prevent municipalities from implementing transformational adaptation. We analyze the Poblenou superblock project in Barcelona, Spain as an effort to enact transformational land use planning linked with climate adaptation efforts. We find that the key driver behind opposition is the everyday political struggle for municipal authority, which materializes in clashing visions for the future city – and who has the political clout to define and own them. We show that urban transformation is at least as much about competitive urbanism and related short-term political gains as it is about the importance of environmental and quality-of-life benefits that are ostensibly the target of interventions. We also highlight how civic and political contestation over the authority of ‘climate champions’ can jeopardize not only transformational adaptation achievements, but also the political survival of champions themselves. We conclude that transformational adaptation can be obstructed not only out of fear for the material and political effects of transformation per se, but also because of the message it conveys as concerns of who has the authority to decide for “the common good”. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Authority; Climate change governance; Competitive urbanism; Mobility planning; Superblock; Transformational adaptation","adaptive management; climate change; future prospect; governance approach; land use planning; policy implementation; urban politics; Barcelona [Barcelona (PRV)]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078728442

In this context, a substantial advantage of small combined heat and power plants is based on the relatively low pollutant emissions. However, a large proportion of the pollutant emissions is produced during a cold-start. This fact is not reflected in governmental and institutional emission guidelines, as these strongly focus on the emission levels under steady-state conditions. This study analyzes the spark advance, the reference air/fuel ratio and an electrically heated catalyst in terms of their potential to reduce the cold-start emissions of a micro combined heat and power plant which uses a natural gas fueled reciprocating internal combustion engine as prime mover and a three-way catalytic converter as aftertreatment system. Based on these measures, control approaches were developed that account for the specific operating conditions of the class of small combined heat and power plants, e.g., full-load operation and flexible, demand-driven runtimes. The experimental data demonstrates that even solutions with marginal adaptation/integration effort can reduce cold-start emissions to a great extent. © 2020 by the authors.

The urban-rural fringe areas emit more greenhouse gases than urban centers. The purpose of this study is to analyze the spatial pattern and driving factors of carbon emissions in urban-rural fringe mixed-use communities, and to develop planning methods to reduce carbon emissions in communities. This study identifies mixed-use communities in East Asian urban-rural fringe areas as industrial, commercial, tourism, and rental-apartment communities, subsequently using the emission factor method to calculate carbon emissions. The statistical information grid analysis and geographic information systems spatial analysis method are employed to analyze the spatial pattern of carbon emission and explore the relationship between established space, industrial economy, material consumption, social behavior, and carbon emission distribution characteristics by partial least squares regression, ultimately summing up the spatial pattern of carbon emission in the urban-rural fringe areas of East Asia. Results show that (1) mixed-use communities in the East Asian urban-rural fringe areas face tremendous pressure to reduce emissions. Mixed-use community carbon emissions in the late urbanization period are lower than those the early urbanization. (2) Mixed-use community carbon emission is featured by characteristics, such as planning structure decisiveness, road directionality, infrastructure directionality, and industrial linkage. (3) Industrial communities produce the highest carbon emissions, followed by rental-apartment communities, business communities, and tourism communities. (4) The driving factor that most affects the spatial distribution of carbon emissions is the material energy consumption. The fuel consumption per unit of land is the largest driver of carbon emissions. Using the obtained spatial pattern and its driving factors of carbon emissions, this study provides suggestions for planning and construction, industrial development, material consumption, and convenient life guidance. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emission; Mixed-use community; Partial least squares; Spatial pattern; Urban-rural fringe area","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; GIS; greenhouse gas; infrastructure; least squares method; planning method; rural-urban comparison; spatial analysis; urban area; urbanization; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084568004

In this study, dynamic downscaling was conducted to produce a regional dataset that incorporated the time period 1986–2100 for the CA. The results show that dynamic downscaling significantly improves the simulation for the mean and extreme climate over the CA, compared to the driving CCSM4 model. We show that significant warming will occur over CA with 2.0 °C and 5.0 °C increasing under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively by the end of twenty-first century. The daily maximum temperature, the daily minimum temperature and the annual total number of days with a minimum temperature greater than 25 °C will also increase significantly. The annual total number of days with a minimum temperature less than 0 °C will decrease significantly. Long-term trends in the projected winter precipitation under different emission scenarios exhibit robust and increasing changes during the twenty-first century, especially under the RCP8.5 scenario with an increasing about 0.1 mm/day. Significant differences are shown in the projection of precipitation-related indices over CA under different emission scenarios, and the impact of emissions is apparent for the number of days with ≥ 10 mm of precipitation, the density of precipitation on days with ≥ 1 mm of precipitation, and particularly for the maximum consecutive number of dry days that will increase significantly under the RCP8.5 scenario. Therefore, reduced greenhouse gases emissions have implications for mitigating extreme drought events over the CA in the future. © 2020, The Author(s).","Central Asia; Dynamic downscaling; Extreme; Projection","climate modeling; climate prediction; downscaling; precipitation (climatology); temperature profile; weather forecasting; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083536503

Engine calibration, a process that optimizes engine performance by tuning engine controls (actuators), becomes challenging nowadays due to significant increase of complexity of modern engines. The traditional sweep-based engine calibration method is no longer sustainable. To tackle the challenge, this work considers two powerful global optimization methods: Genetic algorithm (GA) and Bayesian optimization for steady-state engine calibration for single speed-load point. GA is a branch of meta-heuristic methods that has shown a great potential on solving difficult problems in automotive engineering. Bayesian optimization is an efficient global optimization method that solves problems with computationally expensive testing such as hyperparameter tuning in deep neural network (DNN), engine testing, etc. In real engine testing platform, only the limited number of testing (function evaluations) is available. We customized GA to cope with limited resource by tuning population size and designing self-adaptive mutation operators. Another challenge of engine calibration is that, in real engine testing platform, some solutions cannot even run completely due to the engine hardware limitations. These solutions, called non-operational solutions, are part of infeasible solutions and do not have any information about either objectives or constraints. A constraint repair algorithm is applied to handle non-operational solutions. The experimental study on high-fidelity engine model demonstrated that both customized GA and Bayesian optimization efficiently find solutions very close to global optimum both using less than 400 function evaluations.

However, with a lack of deep understanding of the status quo and composition of community carbon emissions, as well as of the issues in low-carbon actions, the measures taken are often superficial and not targeted, which makes low-carbon activities difficult to implement. This study selected different types of communities for questionnaire surveys online, and conducted field interviews and in-depth surveys afterwards in typical communities. Key data such as community energy consumption, transportation, garbage disposal, and the status of community low-carbon actions were collected, based on which the potentials of carbon reduction were analysed, the obstacles in low-carbon community construction were discussed and corresponding countermeasures were proposed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083200795

In fact, the properties of complex reservoirs are often implicated in logging signals from the whole adjacent region of this certain depth point. So far, there is no effective way to solve this problem completely. For the first time, this letter tried to build a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) to detect hydrocarbon from logging signals for the tight gas reservoir of Ordos Basin. The FCNN was based on a well-designed VGG-net. The prediction comparison between the empirical approach (EMA) and FCNN was implemented on 48 layers. The accuracy of FCNN was about 87.5%, which was higher than that of the EMA (75.0%). FCNN provided more reliable gas testing recommendations, especially when thin layers led to complex reservoir conditions.

This study, for the first time, has applied Kaya identity and LMDI index decomposition method to empirically decompose and measure the driving factors of China's industrial air pollution emissions based on prefecture-level cities. The results suggest that, over the past ten years, the per capita industrial air pollution emissions have increased from both state and regional perspective. The main reason for the increasing trend is the economy's scale effects. Meanwhile, the technological effects and structural effects reduce pollution emissions in the long term. However the environmental-beneficial technology and structural effects are smaller than the scale effects, therefore such an increasing trend cannot be offset by the technological effects. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Emission control; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Sustainable development; Chinese Government; Decomposition methods; Driving factors; Driving forces; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Pollution emissions; Scale effects; Structural effect; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083240658

While the intensity and spatial pattern of an UHI can be influenced by the land-sea breeze, especially in coastal cities, few studies have been done to examine this using the LCZ scheme. In this study, Sendai, Japan, has been selected as a case study to evaluate whether the LCZ scheme can be used to study UHIs that are exposed to sea-land breeze since it has two urban-rural areas: mountain side and coastal side. UHI analysis was based on LCZ classes with GIS-derived geometric and land cover properties. By dividing Sendai into two regions along its urban center, the mitigating effects of sea-land breeze on the magnitudes of UHIs in each urban-rural area were demonstrated. Based on the results of this study, two specific UHI mitigation strategies were proposed for Sendai.

To address this point, we carried out a time-series metagenomic analysis of the functional features of microbial communities at three different Gymnodinium catenatum bloom stages (pre-, peak-, and post-bloom). Different microbial composition were observed during the blooming stages. The environmental parameters and correlation networks co-contribute to microbial variability, and the former explained 38.4% of total variations of the bacterioplankton community composition. Functionally, a range of pathways involved in carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur cycling were significantly different during the various HAB stages. Genes associated with carbohydrate-active enzymes, denitrification, and iron oxidation were enriched at the pre-bloom stage; genes involved in reductive citrate cycle for carbon fixation, carbon degradation, nitrification and phosphate transport were enhanced at the peak stage; and relative gene abundance related to sulfur oxidation, vitamin synthesis, and iron transport and storage was increased at the post-bloom stage. The ecological linkage analysis has shown that microbial functional potential especially the C/P/Fe metabolism were significantly linked to the fate of the algal blooms. Taken together, our results demonstrated that microorganisms displayed successional patterns not only at the community level, but also in the metabolic potential on HAB's progression. This work contributes to a growing understanding of microbial structural elasticity and functional plasticity and shed light on the potential mechanisms of microbial-mediated HAB trajectory. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Algal blooms; Matter cycle; Metagenomic; Microbial functional profiles","Biosynthesis; Ecology; Genes; Iron; Metabolism; Sulfur; Time series analysis; Algal blooms; Community composition; Environmental parameter; Matter cycle; Metagenomic; Microbial communities; Microbial composition; Microbial functional profiles; Microorganisms; carbon; iron; nitrogen; phosphorus; sulfur; vitamin; algal bloom; bacterioplankton; dinoflagellate; environmental fate; functional change; marine ecosystem; microbial community; microorganism; algal bloom; Article; carbon fixation; carbon metabolism; citric acid cycle; degradation; denitrification; environmental parameters; Gymnodinium; Gymnodinium catenatum; iron metabolism; iron storage; iron transport; marine alga; metagenomics; microbial community; nitrification; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; phosphate metabolism; phosphate transport; priority journal; algal bloom; dinoflagellate; microflora; algae; Dinophyceae; Gymnodinium catenatum; Dinoflagellida; Harmful Algal Bloom; Microbiota; Nitrogen; Phosphorus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078734975

Uncovering the temporal and structural characteristics can provide scientific support to identify the variation regulation and main subjects of urban traffic CO2 emissions. The road class is one of the most important factors influencing the urban traffic CO2 emissions. Based on the annual traffic field monitoring work in 2014 and the localized MOVES model, this study unravels the temporal variation and structural characteristics of the urban traffic CO2 emissions and conducts a comparative analysis of expressway (5R) and arterial road (DB), two typical classes of urban roads in Beijing. Obvious differences exist in the temporal variation characteristics of the traffic CO2 emissions between the expressway and arterial road at the annual, week and daily scales. The annual traffic CO2 emissions at the expressway (5R, with 47271.15 t) are more than ten times than those of the arterial road (DB, with 4139.19 t). Stronger weekly ""rest effect"" is observed at the expressway than the arterial road. The daily peak time and duration of the traffic CO2 emissions between the two classes of urban roads show significant differences particular in the evening peak. The differences of the structural characteristics between the two classes of urban roads are mainly reflected on the contribution of the public and freight transportation. Passenger vehicles play a predominant role at both the two classes of urban roads. The public transportation contributed more at DB (24.76%) than 5R (5.47%), and the freight transportation contributed more at 5R (23.41%) than DB (3.49%). The results suggest that the influence of traffic CO2 emissions on the CO2 flux is significant at the residential and commercial mixed underlying urban areas with arterial roads (DB) but not significant at the underlying urban park area with expressway (5R) in this study. The vegetation cover in urban areas have effects on the CO2 reduction. Increasing the design and construction of the green space along the urban roads with busy traffic flow will be an effective way to mitigate the urban traffic CO2 emissions and build the low-carbon cities. © 2020 Zheng et al.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon; carbon dioxide; Article; car; carbon dioxide transport; carbon footprint; China; comparative study; controlled study; motor vehicle; traffic; traffic and transport; urban area; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; procedures; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083377857

In this study, China's production-based PM2.5 emissions were estimated by compiling sectoral resolution PM2.5 emission inventories. Integrated with a multiregional input-output model, the consumption-based PM2.5 emissions from 30 provinces in 2012 were calculated. Only approximately 14% of the PM2.5 emissions were induced by consumers’ direct usage, while 86% of the emissions were triggered by upstreaming production processes, as quantified by simulation in the structural path analysis model. For specific sectors, ‘other services’ play an important role in direct usage, while ‘nonmetal products’, ‘petroleum refining’, ‘metallurgy’, ‘coal mining’ and ‘chemical industry’ are the dominant PM2.5 emission sectors in subsequent supply chains, which has implications for optimization of the industrial structure as well as for improving energy utilization efficiency to a reasonable level for production processes. Furthermore, this study investigated consumption-based PM2.5 emissions transfer from original to destination provinces, which varied from 9%∼84%. Most of the consumption PM2.5 emissions dominant provinces located in east coastal of China, outsourcing PM2.5 emissions to Central and Western China, such as Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Guizhou and Hebei, each accounted for more than 50% of their total PM2.5 emissions. In addition, all provinces except Xinjiang present spatial connections with surrounding provinces through close trade cooperation. The findings of this research provide a solid foundation for identifying different provinces’ responsibility for air pollutant control and proposing insightful observations to help policymakers to formulate associated cross-regional PM2.5 emissions reduction and control measures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Consumption-based accounting; Embodied PM2.5 emissions; Multiregional input-output model; Production-based accounting","Chemical industry; Coal industry; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Petroleum industry; Petroleum refining; Regression analysis; Supply chains; Emission inventories; Emissions reduction; Empirical analysis; Energy utilization efficiency; Industrial structures; Input output model; Production and consumption; Production process; Commerce; consumption behavior; emission inventory; empirical analysis; energy efficiency; industrial structure; input-output analysis; particulate matter; regional trade; air pollution; Article; China; particulate matter; China; Guizhou; Hebei; Nei Monggol; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077754727

This effect cannot be modeled by the ground-state Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BO-MD), where the electronic structure is at the ground state for every step of ions' movement. Although the non-adiabatic effect has been explored extensively in gas phase reactions, its role in electrochemical reactions, such as water splitting and CO2 reduction, in electrolyte has been rarely explored. On the other hand, electrochemical reactions usually involve electron transport; thus, a non-adiabatic process can naturally play a significant role. In this work, using one-step CO2 reduction as an example, we investigated the role of the non-adiabatic effect in the reaction. The reaction barriers were computed by adiabatic BO-MD and non-adiabatic real-time time dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT). We found that by including the non-adiabatic effect, rt-TDDFT could increase the reaction barrier up to 6% compared to the BO-MD calculated barrier when the solvent model is used to represent water. Simulations were carried out using explicit water molecules around the reaction site under different overpotentials, and similar non-adiabatic effects were found. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Carbon dioxide; Density functional theory; Electrolytes; Electron transport properties; Electronic structure; Ground state; Molecular dynamics; Molecules; Phase interfaces; Reduction; Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation; Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics; Electrochemical reactions; Electronic excitation; Explicit water molecules; Non-adiabatic effect; Non-adiabatic process; Time dependent density functional theory; Reaction kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084178500

Applying an air pollution monitoring data sample of 87 cities in eastern China, empirically tests the relationship between air pollution regulation, technological investment, and green economic growth. The positive influence of air pollution regulation on GTFP in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is higher than that in the Yangtze River Delta region. Therefore, improving the coordinated monitoring mechanism of environment and economic development can achieve co-benefits. Technological investment can promote the improvement of GTFP, but it could have a negative impact on green technology progress in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The output efficiency of technological investment should be improved.

Therefore, in order to understand the spatial–temporal variations and controlling mechanisms of global forest carbon (C) storage under future climate change, an improved individual-based forest ecosystem carbon budget model and remote sensing outputs in this study were applied to investigate the spatial–temporal dynamics of global forest (vegetation+soil) C storage in the future climate change scenario. The results showed that in the future RCP4.5 (representative concentration pathways) climate scenario, the total C storage per unit area per year in vegetation and soil of the global forest ecosystem showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing from 2006 to 2100, with an average of 22.77 kg C m−2 year−1. However, the evolution trends of C storage changes in vegetation and soil were different. Moreover, the average soil C storage per unit area per year was 2.87 times higher than the average vegetation C storage. The impact of climate change on total C storage in vegetation and soil of the global forest ecosystems was positive, showing an obvious increase during 2006–2100. The total C storage varied significantly in spatial distribution. Spatially, the vegetation C storage and the soil organic C storage were projected to decrease significantly in most parts of South America and southern Africa in the Southern Hemisphere and increase in eastern North America, western Asia, and most areas of Europe in the Northern Hemisphere. Especially in the middle and high latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere, the total forest C stock was projected to increase by 30–90% from 2046 to 2100. In the future, in these areas where forest C reserves were predicted to be reduced, it was suggested to increase afforestation, prohibit deforestation, and develop projects to increase forest C. Sustainable forest managements also offered opportunities for immediate mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Our findings provided not only a projection of C storage of global forest ecosystem responses to future climate change but also a useful methodology for estimating forest C storage at global levels. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","FORCCHN model; Future climate change; Global forest ecosystems; Response; Soil C storage; Vegetation C storage","carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; climate change; forest ecosystem; remote sensing; Southern Hemisphere; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal variation; Europe; South America; Southern Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069866397

The southern and southwestern areas, generally 60 300 km away from Beijing, were seriously polluted in contrast to Beijing, which remained clean. Southerly winds moving faster than 20 30 km h-1 since the early morning primarily caused haze pollution initiation. The PM2.5 (particulate matter with a dynamic equivalent diameter smaller than 2.5 μm) level increased to 75 μgm-3 over several hours during the daytime, which was simultaneously affected by the ABL structure. Additionally, the O3 concentration was quite high during the daytime (250 μgm-3), corresponding to a high atmospheric oxidation capacity. Much sulfate and nitrate were produced through active atmospheric chemical processes, with sulfur oxidation ratios (SORs) up to ~ 0.76 and nitrogen oxidation ratios (NORs) increasing from 0.09 to 0.26, which further facilitated particulate matter (PM) level enhancement. However, the increase in sulfate was mainly linked to southerly transport. At midnight, the PM2.5 concentration sharply increased from 75 to 150 μgm-3 over 4 h and remained at its highest level until the next morning. Under an extremely stable ABL structure, secondary aerosol formation dominated by nitrate was quite intense, driving the haze pollution outbreak. The PM levels in the southern and southeastern areas of Beijing were significantly lower than those in Beijing at this time, even below air quality standards; thus, the contribution of pollution transport had almost disappeared. With the formation of a nocturnal stable boundary layer (NSBL) at an altitude ranging from 0 0.3 km, the extremely low turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) ranging from 0 to 0.05m2 s-2 inhibited the spread of particles and moisture, ultimately resulting in elevated near-surface PM2.5 and relative humidity (~ 90 %) levels. Due to the very high humidity and ambient oxidization capacity, NOR rapidly increased from 0.26 to 0.60, and heterogeneous hydrolysis reactions at the moist particle surface were very notable. The nitrate concentration steeply increased from 11.6 to 57.8 μgm-3, while the sulfate and organics concentrations slightly increased by 6.1 and 3.1 μgm-3, respectively. With clean and strong winds passing through Beijing, the stable ABL dissipated with the potential temperature gradient becoming negative and the ABL height (ABLH) increasing to ~ 2:5 km. The high turbulence activity with a TKE ranging from 3 to 5m2 s-2 notably promoted pollution diffusion. The selfcleaning capacity of the atmosphere is commonly responsi-ble for air pollution dispersion. However, reducing the atmospheric oxidization capacity, through strengthening collaborative control of nitrogen oxide (NOx ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as well as continuously deepening regional joint air pollution control, is urgent. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

However, little quantitative research has been conducted under the BRI in the same framework. Therefore, by developing a data envelopment analysis optimisation model combined with the window analysis method, this paper investigates the energy performance of BRI countries for the period from 1995 to 2015, and evaluate the potential of energy saving and CO2 emissions reduction for each BRI country. The results show that, first, the average energy performance of 56 BRI countries is about 0.69, with evident difference across regions and countries. Specifically, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe and Central Asia, energy performance is relatively lower, and their averages are 0.59 and 0.60, respectively; in particular, Ukraine has the lowest energy performance among the 56 BRI countries (0.24); while the energy performance in Middle East and North Africa and South Asia appears relatively higher (0.80 and 0.89, respectively). Second, these 56 BRI countries have great energy saving potential, about 9.95 billion metric tonnes of oil equivalent from 1995 to 2015. Among them, Europe and Central Asia, East Asia and Pacific, and Middle East and North Africa make relatively larger contribution. Finally, these 56 BRI countries may produce potential CO2 emissions reduction of 50.87 billion metric tonnes during the study period, and Europe and Central Asia and East Asia and Pacific contribute the most (45.18% and 25.53%, respectively). © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Belt and Road Initiative; CO2 emissions reduction; Data envelopment analysis; Energy saving",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051852716

To ascertain if China's SO2 and NOx emissions reductions in the recent years are reflected in reduced impacts, sulfur and nitrogen wet deposition at Mt. Emei was observed during 2017–2019. The source contributions to sulfur and nitrogen wet deposition were estimated using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) and the source-oriented Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The annual Volume Weighted Mean (VWM) pH of precipitation increased from 4.01 to 4.75 in the 1980s–2000s to 5.39 in 2017–2019. However, 12% of the samples during 2017–2019 had pH &lt; 4.50. The VWM SO4 2− concentration decreased from 80.9 to 26.0 μeq L−1 from 2007–2009 to 2017–2019. The VWM NO3 − concentration (18.3 μeq L−1) in 2017–2019 was close to that measured in 2007–2009. Although the dry deposition fluxes onto forest canopy were under-estimated, the mean annual total wet and dry deposition flux of nitrogen (24.3 kg N ha−1 yr−1) was higher than the critical load (CL: 10.0–15.0 kg N ha−1 yr−1), while the flux of sulfur (12.1 kg S ha−1 yr−1) was lower than the CL (16.0–32.0 kg S ha−1 yr−1). The annual wet deposition fluxes of SO4 2− and NO3 − were mainly from industries (54% and 43%, respectively) and power plants (21% and 25%, respectively), and that of NH4 + was mostly from agriculture (88%). Emissions within and outside the Sichuan Basin (SCB) were both important sources of the wet deposition fluxes of sulfur (45% and 39%, respectively) and nitrogen (68% and 29%, respectively), and other unidentified sources accounted for 16% and 3% of the sulfur and nitrogen fluxes, respectively. This study suggests that to protect Mt. Emei's ecosystems, efforts are needed to further control sulfur and nitrogen deposition through reducing emissions within and outside the SCB. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acid rain; Air pollution; Emission control; Positive matrix factorization; Source-oriented CMAQ","Acid rain; Air pollution; Air quality; Emission control; Factorization; Matrix algebra; Anthropogenic impacts; Community multi-scale air qualities; Dry deposition fluxes; Nitrogen deposition; PH of precipitations; Positive Matrix Factorization; Source contributions; Source-oriented CMAQ; Nitrogen; nitrogen; sulfur; acid rain; annual variation; atmospheric pollution; emission control; matrix; nitrogen; sulfur; wet deposition; acidity; agriculture; air quality; Article; canopy; China; concentration (parameter); conductance; dry deposition; ecosystem; electric power plant; industry; pH; precipitation; priority journal; wet deposition; China; Emeishan; Sichuan; Sichuan Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078065678

A non-plug-in hybrid light-duty gasoline vehicles (HEV) sold in the Chinese market was selected to study real road emissions employed fast response NOx analyzer from Cambustion Ltd. with a sampling frequency of 100Hz, which can measure the missing NO peaks by standard RDE gas analyzer now. Emissions from PEMS were also recorded and compared with the results from fast response NOx analyzer. The concentration of NOx emissions before and after the Three Way Catalyst (TWC) of the hybrid vehicle were also sampled and analyzed, and the working efficiency of the TWC in real road driving process was investigated. It is found that when the engine is at high-speed and heavy-load conditions, especially when fuel is injected after fuel cut, instantaneous spikes in tailpipe NO emissions could be observed, which means that traffic positions such as crosswalks, speed bumps, expressway entrances, traffic lights, would lead to higher NOx emissions, because the instantaneous fuel cut-off occurs during the acceleration shifting process, the TWC is in an oxygen-rich state. Obvious transient effects were revealed and the results could be used for further reducing NOx emissions from automotive RDE and engine calibration of RDE. © 2020 SAE International.

This study aims to evaluate China's decoupling level between PM2.5 emissions and economic growth from a regional investment perspective. Using the panel data of 30 Chinese provinces for the period of 1998–2016, this study combines decomposition analysis with decoupling analysis to identify the roles of conventional factors and three novel investment factors in the mitigation and decoupling of PM2.5 emissions in China and its four sub-regions. The results show that China's PM2.5 emissions were weakly decoupled to economic growth during the period of 1998–2016, as well as in China's four sub-regions. At the national level, investment scale played the dominant role while investment structure had a marginal effect in mitigating the decoupling level. In contrast, emission intensity was the largest driver in promoting the decoupling effect. At the regional level, emission intensity and investment efficiency accelerated the regional decoupling level, but the coupling effect from investment scale in the western region far exceeded those in other three sub-regions. At the provincial level, the investment structure of Inner Mongolia and investment scales of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia had the greatest impacts on PM2.5 emission growth. Finally, several policy recommendations are raised for China to mitigate its PM2.5 emissions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; Decoupling; Economic growth; Governance; Investment; PM2.5 emissions","Investments; China; Decomposition analysis; Decoupling; Economic growths; Environmental pollutions; Governance; Investment efficiency; Policy recommendations; Economics; decomposition analysis; economic growth; emission control; investment; panel data; particulate matter; regional economy; article; decomposition; economic development; Inner Mongolia; investment; structure activity relation; Xinjiang; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078127423

However, particulate matter emissions are an essential issue for GDI engine development due to increasingly stringent worldwide emission regulations. Previous studies have shown that gasoline fuel compositions, as well as deposits formed in GDI fuel injectors, can affect emissions in the GDI engine. In this work, the impact of gasoline fuel properties on forming injector deposits and the resulting effect on particulate emissions were investigated using a modern Chinese GDI engine. Six test fuels with different properties involving changes in olefins, aromatics, heavy (C9/C9+) aromatics, T90 and deposit control additive (DCA) were prepared based on the gasoline survey results from the Chinese gasoline fuel market and the China 6 gasoline fuel standard limits. A 1.0L 3-cylinder turbocharged GDI engine in the Chinese market was prepared and operated under a steady-state condition (2000 rpm, 3 bar BMEP load) lasting for 55 hours to accumulate injector deposits. The injector flow rate and injection pulse width changes caused by injector deposits were measured when different gasoline fuels were used. Meanwhile, the engine out particle number (PN) emissions were measured before, during and after the fouling tests. Test results indicated that fuel properties showed an obvious impact on GDI injector deposit formation and the PN emissions significantly increased after injector fouling. Gasoline fuels with higher olefin, aromatic and heavy aromatic contents generated more deposits in GDI injectors and resulted in higher PN emissions, while fuel containing DCA was effective in reducing the injector deposit formation and PN emissions. It was also observed that when T90 of the fuel reached 180 °C with increasing amount of heavy aromatics, the injector fouling tendency was reduced, indicating the complicated formation mechanism of deposits in GDI injectors. © 2020 SAE International.

Recent sampling efforts and following metagenomics have shed light on the global ocean microbial diversity and function, yet the microbiota of polar regions has not been included in such global analyses. Results: Here a metagenomic study of seawater samples (n = 60) collected from different depths at 28 locations in the Arctic and Antarctic zones was performed, together with metagenomes from the Tara Oceans. More than 7500 (19%) polar seawater-derived operational taxonomic units could not be identified in the Tara Oceans datasets, and more than 3,900,000 protein-coding gene orthologs had no hits in the Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalog. Analysis of 214 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered from the polar seawater microbiomes, revealed strains that are prevalent in the polar regions while nearly undetectable in temperate seawater. Metabolic pathway reconstruction for these microbes suggested versatility for saccharide and lipids biosynthesis, nitrate and sulfate reduction, and CO2 fixation. Comparison between the Arctic and Antarctic microbiomes revealed that antibiotic resistance genes were enriched in the Arctic while functions like DNA recombination were enriched in the Antarctic. Conclusions: Our data highlight the occurrence of dominant and locally enriched microbes in the Arctic and Antarctic seawater with unique functional traits for environmental adaption, and provide a foundation for analyzing the global ocean microbiome in a more complete perspective.

Many methods have been used to evaluate the effect and efficiency of the ETS in reducing carbon emissions. Evaluating the carbon ETS to determine whether it has co-benefited the economy and environment in the seven pilots is crucial for the development of China. Moreover, different methods of measurement reveal different results on how efficient the seven carbon emission trading markets (ETMs) are. We use the difference-in-differences (DID) method to evaluate the impact of carbon emissions and economic growth following ETS implementation. Based on the data of industrial carbon emissions in 30 provinces of China from 2008 to 2016, the impact of ETS on the carbon emission reduction and economic growth of enterprises is empirically tested. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) evaluates the operating efficiency of the carbon ETMs. Based on the seven carbon emission trading pilots conducted in China in 2014–2016, the carbon ETMs differentiation system in the pilot area is taken as the input index and the ETS implementation effect is used as the output index to construct the full DEA evaluation model for gauging the operation efficiency of the carbon ETMs. The results show that the implementation of the carbon trading policy increases the economic dividend (13.6%) generated by the gross industrial output value, but significantly reduces the emission (24.2%) of industrial CO2 in all seven carbon emission trading pilots.

Quantifying the changes of pollutant emissions due to COVID-19 and associated governmental control measures is crucial to understand its impacts on economy, air pollution, and society. We used the WRF-GC model and the tropospheric NO2 column observations retrieved by the TROPOMI instrument to derive the top-down NOx emission change estimation between the three periods: P1 (January 1st to January 22nd, 2020), P2 (January 23rd, Wuhan lockdown, to February 9th, 2020), and P3 (February 10th, back-to-work day, to March 12th, 2020). We found that NOx emissions in East China averaged during P2 decreased by 50% compared to those averaged during P1. The NOx emissions averaged during P3 increased by 26% compared to those during P2. Most provinces in East China gradually regained some of their NOx emissions after February 10, the official back-to-work day, but NOx emissions in most provinces have not yet to return to their previous levels in early January. NOx emissions in Wuhan, the first epicenter of COVID-19, had no sign of emission recovering by March 12. A few provinces, such as Zhejiang and Shanxi, have recovered fast, with their averaged NOx emissions during P3 almost back to pre-lockdown levels. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; COVID-19; GEOS-Chem; NOx emission; Satellite retrieval; WRF-GC","Emission control; Recovery; Control measures; East China; NOx emissions; Pollutant emission; Topdown; Zhejiang; Nitrogen oxides; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; emission control; nitrogen oxides; pollution control; respiratory disease; viral disease; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085248363

However, there exists a research gap of employing econometric models to enrich the ECA policy evaluation research by testing the effectiveness of an ECA policy based on the empirical data. This paper focuses on the effectiveness of the ECA policy in shanghai port by adopting regression discontinuity (RD) approach. The RD design is considered as a wonderful substitution for the randomized control trial, which usually serves as a conventional and effective tool to address endogeneity. The causal effect of the ECA policy on the SO2 concentration reduction can be detected by the RD approach. According to the estimated results, there is a discontinuity around the ECA policy cutoff point, and it is indicated that the SO2 concentration in Shanghai decreased by at least 0.229 μg/m3 daily on average due to the implementation of the ECA policy. The positive role that the ECA policy plays in reducing SO2 concentration in Shanghai is well demonstrated.

To study the emission characteristics of non-road mobile machinery, three types of non-road construction machinery used in the city were selected for testing and sampling. A Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) was used to obtain instantaneous exhaust emissions, and a portable particulate sampling system was used to collect PM2.5 samples from three types of construction machinery. The elements, water-soluble ions (WSIs), organic carbon (OC)/elemental carbon (EC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analysed. The China III standards for non-road construction machinery are stricter than the China II and China I construction machinery standards, indicating that strict regulations can help reduce PM emissions from non-road construction machinery. The results show that the fraction of the chemical components including elements, WSIs, OC/EC and PAHs to particulate matter is from 67.30% to 64.10%. The SO4 2−/NO3 − ratio of each test vehicle is less than 1. The CE/AE values are all greater than 1, and the exhaust particles are alkaline. The estimated concentrations of secondary organic carbon (SOC) in the particulates discharged from loaders, excavators and forklifts are 3.73 mg/m3, 0.25 mg/m3 and 0.42 mg/m3, respectively, indicating the presence of secondary aerosols. The LMW-PAHs and MMW-PAHs were the major PAH species in the particulate matter, whereas a low concentration of HMW-PAHs is considered to be more harmful to human health than the other PAHs. All the PAH BaPeq values are higher than the BaP concentrations recommended by the World Health Organization.

It has been reported as an active catalyst for the formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) during de novo tests, yet its specific mode of action has remained unclear. This study aims to identify the effects of chromium chloride on the formation of PCDD/F and other chloro-aromatics and to elucidate the underlying reaction mechanisms. A series of de novo tests, conducted over a wide range of temperature (from 250 to 550 °C) and for four different oxygen contents (0, 5, 10, 20 %), confirmed the promoting effect of CrCl3 on the PCDD/F formation. In situ X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) spectroscopy was applied to investigate the behavior of CrCl3 during heating, describing the entire picture of CrCl3-promoted formation pathways of dioxins. The effect of oxygen was studied by measuring XAFS spectra on samples heated at different oxygen concentrations. According to these spectra, chromium compounds play two key roles during dioxins formation: (a) chlorinating carbon, using chlorine derived from conversion of CrCl3 into Cr2O3, and further oxidation to Cr(VI), and (b) facilitating oxidative destruction of the carbon matrix, while reducing Cr(VI) to Cr2O3. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chromium chloride; Formation mechanisms; In situ X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS); Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDF)","Atomic physics; Carbon; Chlorine compounds; Municipal solid waste; Organic pollutants; Oxygen; Waste incineration; X ray absorption; Chromium chloride; Dibenzofurans; Formation mechanism; Formation pathways; Oxygen concentrations; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans; Reaction mechanism; Situ x-rays; Chromium compounds; chloride; chromium; chromium chloride; dibenzofuran derivative; dioxin; oxygen; catalysis; catalyst; chloride; chromium; concentration (composition); dioxin; incineration; municipal solid waste; oxidation; oxygen; PCDD; temperature; thermochemistry; Article; chemical reaction; chemical structure; fly ash; incineration; municipal solid waste; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077753718

Ever since February 22th, 2018, private cars that belong to Beijing have been treated equally as local cars of Tianjin. However, existing studies rarely compare the effects of driving restrictions in different cities. In this paper, using the regression discontinuity design (RDD) model and urban air quality monitoring data from Beijing and Tianjin during the period 2014 to 2018, we explore whether driving restriction policies can improve air quality in Beijing and Tianjin. The main results are as follows. (1) Our results of regression discontinuity design revealed that the DR had no obvious improvement in the air quality in Tianjin. Furthermore, the effect of the DR decreases along with its implementation. (2) The implementation of the DR in Tianjin had slight improvement in air quality in Beijing, which mainly reduced emissions from cars. In other words, the DR brought about weak externality. (3) We found that the effect of NDR on the air pollution was limited in both Tianjin and Beijing. To sum up, we compared the NDR with DR and found out that the DR was more effective in the short run, while the NDR could work well in the long term. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Beijing-Tianjin; Driving restriction; Regression discontinuity","Regression analysis; Driving restrictions; Private cars; Regression discontinuity; Tianjin; Urban air quality; Air quality; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; regression analysis; air pollution; air quality; article; China; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077510611

Many local original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) develop PHEVs based on their internal combustion engine (ICE) base models without significant modification on engine side. Traditional ICE vehicles are solely driven by engines, while PHEVs can be driven by engine or electric motors, independently or together, depending on powertrain architecture and operating strategy. PHEVs may have more particle number or particulate matter (PN/PM) emissions. To meet CN6 regulation, gasoline particulate filters (GPFs) are widely used for both PHEV and traditional cars. It is important to investigate the impacts of hybrid powertrain on gasoline particulate filter applications. This paper compares GPF application development for a traditional BYD Tang (ICE base model) and a BYD Tang DM (PHEV model). Same aftertreatment design with slightly different layout is used to cover both models to meet PM/PN/gaseous emission standards. GPF soot loading and burning behavior are compared. In general, the soot management scheme from ICE can be effectively applied to PHEV without significant changes. © 2020 SAE International.

Data were collected from 1538 rice farmers in the province of Hubei, China. We empirically examine the determinants of rice growers' intentions towards mitigation and adaption and their actual behaviors via partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our results indicate that for TPB, behavioral intentions and perceived behavioral control account for 42.1% of farmers' adaptation behaviors, but only 25.6% for mitigation behaviors. In contrast, for the VBN theory, proenvironmental personal norms explain 54.2% of growers’ mitigation behaviors, but only 28.4% of adaptation behaviors. Thus, TPB appears to be more successful at predicting self-interest-oriented behaviors, such as climate change adaptation. On the other hand, our findings provide evidence that the VBN theory performs better when explaining altruistic behaviors like mitigation behaviors. These conclusions have important implications for the formulation of future policies that aim to promote effective and sustainable proenvironmental behavioral changes in agriculture, while ensuring global food security. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation behavior; Climate change; Mitigation behavior; Rice production; theory of planned behavior; Value-belief-norm theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081029720

Four groups of 21-day-old male piglets (n = 7/group) were fed a control diet or diet containing 1.0 or 3.0 mg DON/kg, or 3.0 mg DON/kg plus 0.05% modified HSCAS for 4 weeks. Compared to the control, the DON diets decreased serum porcine circovirus antibody titer and the dermal hypersensitivity response to OVA at day 21 or 28. DON also induced focal necrosis and proliferation of cortical lymphocytes and apoptosis and increased the total antioxidant capacity and reduced glutathione, protein carbonyl concentrations in thymus. DON increased thymus mRNA, protein and (or) enzyme levels, cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) and apoptosis-related genes (Caspase-3), while hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) decreased. Intriguingly, the modified HSCAS alleviated the DON-induced changes on serum antibody titer, and thymic histopathology, apoptosis, redox status, inflammation and apoptosis signaling. In conclusion, these findings help to explain the toxic effects and mechanisms of DON and demonstrated the modified HSCAS adsorbent could be used to reduce the toxicity of DON in weaning piglets. © 2020","Deoxynivalenol; Detoxification; Immune organ; Immune response; Weaning pigs","adsorbent; glutathione; hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate; unclassified drug; virus antibody; vomitoxin; aluminum silicate; antioxidant; caspase 3; catalase; cytokine; glutathione; hematopoietic cell kinase; malonaldehyde; sodium calcium aluminosilicate, hydrated; superoxide dismutase; trichothecene derivative; tumor necrosis factor; virus antibody; virus vaccine; vomitoxin; adaptive immunity; animal experiment; antibody blood level; antibody titer; apoptosis; Article; caspase 3 gene; Circovirus; controlled study; detoxification; drug efficacy; gene; HCK gene; histopathology; IL 10 gene; IL 6 gene; immunotoxicity; inflammation; male; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; piglet; signal transduction; TNF alpha gene; adaptive immunity; animal; animal food; blood; chemistry; diet; drug effect; food contamination; genetics; immunology; metabolism; newborn; pig; spleen; thymus; veterinary medicine; weaning; Adaptive Immunity; Aluminum Silicates; Animal Feed; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Antibodies, Viral; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Caspase 3; Catalase; Circovirus; Cytokines; Diet; Food Contamination; Glutathione; Male; Malondialdehyde; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck; Spleen; Superoxide Dismutase; Swine; Thymus Gland; Trichothecenes; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Viral Vaccines; Weaning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079381262

We here proposed an innovative green technique aimed at reducing the CH4 emissions from constructed wetlands (CWs) in which CH4 is controlled by microbial fuel cells (MFCs). The results of our work indicated that CH4 emissions from CWs could be controlled by operating MFC. The CH4 fluxes significantly decreased in the MFC-CW (close circuit CC) compared with the control MFC-CW (open circuit OC). The bioelectricity generation and COD removal rates also differed in the two systems. The highest power density (0.27 W m−3) and the lowest CH4 emissions (4.7 mg m−2 h−1) were observed in the CC system. The plants’ effects on the performance of the MFC-CWs were also investigated. The plant species had a profound impact on the CH4 emissions and electricity production in MFC-CWs. The greatest CH4 flux (9.5 mg m−2 h−1) was observed from the MFC-CW planted with Typha orientalis, while the CH4 emissions from the MFC-CW planted with Cyperus alternifolius were reduced by 45%. Additional microbial processes were investigated. Quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) analysis indicated that the gene abundance of eubacterial 16 S rRNA, particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA), and methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) significantly differed for the control CW and MFC-CWs planted with different plants. In the CC systems, the mcrA genes in the anode were low, while the pmoA genes in the cathode were high. The operation of MFCs in CWs changed the exoelectrogenic and methanogenic community structures. Sequencing analysis indicated that phylotypes related to Geobacter, Bacteroides, and Desulfovibrio were specifically enriched in the CC systems. The results demonstrated that the operation of MFCs in the CWs resulted in the competition between the electrogenes and methanogenes, which resulted in distinctive microbial populations and biochemical processes that suppressed the CH4 emissions from the CWs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CH4 control; Constructed wetland (CW); Microbial fuel cell (MFC); Microbial mechanisms; Plant species","bacterial enzyme; bacterial RNA; methane; methane monooxygenase; methyl coenzyme M reductase; oxidoreductase; RNA 16S; unclassified drug; bacterium; chemical oxygen demand; constructed wetland; electricity generation; emission control; enzyme activity; fuel cell; global warming; innovation; methane; microbial activity; performance assessment; plant; polymerase chain reaction; quantitative analysis; Article; Bacteroides; carbon footprint; chemical oxygen demand; community structure; concentration (parameter); constructed wetland; controlled study; Cyperus; Cyperus alternifolius; density; Desulfovibrio; electricity; Eubacterium; gene sequence; Geobacter; microbial community; microbial fuel cell; nonhuman; pollution control; real time polymerase chain reaction; Typha; Typha orientalis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroides; Cyperus alternifolius; Desulfovibrio; Geobacter; Typha orientalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078183413

Summarized by 14 specific AA, the total hydrolysable AA (THAA), particulate AA (PAA), and sediment AA (SAA) varied in ranges of 2.29–9.05 µmol L−1, 5.22–22.96 µmol L−1, and 81.7–137.19 µg g−1 dry weight. After the regulation, dissolved free AA (DFAA) decreased by 29% while DCAA increased by 72%. These variations suggested that DFAA were further degraded, while DCAA molecules were further activated. Meanwhile, PAA increased almost 4 times as many as those before regulation, and SAA increased as well. After regulation, the amounts of bioactive amino acids (Asp, Glu and Gly) increased in THAA but decreased in PAA, with little changes in SAA. The ratios of Asp/Gly in different phases increased after regulation, indicating the AA contributions were promoted by calcareous organisms rather than by siliceous organisms. Multiple correlation analysis showed that PAA was primary representatives of AA and organic carbon, followed by DCAA and POC. Moreover, bacterial reproduction played a key role in shaping the AA compositions and properties, followed by the redox condition and acid-base balance.

Despite this, the strength and recent direction of these feedbacks are still unclear. The response of boreal peatlands to climate warming has received relatively little attention compared with other northern peatland types, despite forming a large northern hemisphere-wide ecosystem. Here, we studied the response of two ombrotrophic boreal peatlands to climate variability over the last c. 200 years for which local meteorological data are available. We used remains from plants and testate amoebae to study historical changes in peatland biological communities. These data were supplemented by peat property (bulk density, carbon and nitrogen content), 14C, 210Pb and 137Cs analyses and were used to infer changes in peatland hydrology and carbon dynamics. In total, six peat cores, three per study site, were studied that represent different microhabitats: low hummock (LH), high lawn and low lawn. The data show a consistent drying trend over recent centuries, represented mainly as a change from wet habitat Sphagnum spp. to dry habitat S. fuscum. Summer temperature and precipitation appeared to be important drivers shaping peatland community and surface moisture conditions. Data from the driest microhabitat studied, LH, revealed a clear and strong negative linear correlation (R2 =.5031; p &lt;.001) between carbon accumulation rate and peat surface moisture conditions: under dry conditions, less carbon was accumulated. This suggests that at the dry end of the moisture gradient, availability of water regulates carbon accumulation. It can be further linked to the decreased abundance of mixotrophic testate amoebae under drier conditions (R2 =.4207; p &lt;.001). Our study implies that if effective precipitation decreases in the future, the carbon uptake capacity of boreal bogs may be threatened. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","boreal bogs; carbon accumulation; drying; global warming; peatland community shifts","biogeochemical cycle; bog; Boreal; carbon storage; future prospect; global warming; peatland; Sphagnum; Sphagnum fuscum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081757940

Understanding the bioaccessibility of heavy metals in urban dust is a key to its risk assessment. After the G20 summit in 2016, Hangzhou city has received much attention, including its environmental health risk. The surface dust collected from three different functional areas in Hangzhou were subjected to the in vitro physiologically based extraction test (PBET) to measure the bioaccessibility of Pb and Cd. In terms of spatial variation, the distribution of Pb bioaccessibility was in the order of residential areas > city parks > main roads > the Botanic Garden, while for Cd ordered in city parks > residential areas > main roads > the Botanic Garden. For temporal variation, the bioaccessibility of Pb was higher in autumn and winter, and the bioaccessibility of Cd was higher in spring and autumn. Based on multiple linear statistical analysis, the relationship between the spatial and temporal distribution differences of the bioaccessibility of Pb and Cd in the city and the main components was discussed. Meanwhile, the non-carcinogenic hazard quotients of Pb and the carcinogenic risk of Cd were calculated and showed no harm to human health, except the total Pb in the surface dust with a high non-carcinogenic risk for infants.

Using dynamic panel data from 64 prefecture-level cities in four typical urban agglomerations in China from 2006 to 2016, this paper constructed a stochastic frontier analysis model to empirically measure the city-level total-factor carbon emission efficiency index (TCEI) at different stages of urbanization and to identify rules governing its spatiotemporal evolution. We quantitatively analyzed the influences and functional characteristics of TCEI in the four urban agglomerations of Pearl River Delta, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and Chengdu-Chongqing. Results show that the TCEI at different stages of urbanization in these urban agglomerations is increasing year by year. The overall city-level TCEI was ranked as follows: Pearl River Delta > Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei > Yangtze River Delta > Chengdu-Chongqing. Improvements in the level of economic development and urbanization will help achieve low-carbon development in a given urban agglomeration. The optimization of industrial structure and improvement of ecological environment will help curb carbon emissions.

In this context, the cities in GBA began to plant a variety of urban trees since 2000 which are considered to play an important role in fixing carbon, improving air quality, reducing noise and providing other ecosystem services. However, data on the growth patterns and ecosystem services of the planted trees remains scarce, which hampers a comprehensive understanding of how well the planted trees adapt to the local urban environment. Therefore, we selected three widely planted tree species in Foshan, one of the core cities in GBA and investigated their tree growth and ecosystem services via a harvest campaign and soil analysis. With the same, fast tree growth as natural forests and the greatest above-and below-ground biomass among the three tree species, Ml (Mytilaria laosensis Lec.) showed a distinguished adaption to the local urban environment in terms of growth patterns, carbon fixation, stabilization against typhoon risk and water uptake capacity against potential drought risk in the future. Although Cf (Chinese fir) showed reduced diameter at breast height (DBH) and volume development, it significantly increased the total and available potassium in soils to improve the soil quality. The DBH growth of Sp (Slash pine) decreased between six and 12 years old while it recovered at the age of 12 years, probably suggesting its adaptation might take a longer time. Our results indicated that different trees had different growth patterns and ecosystem services after they were planted in cities. In a harsh urban environment under climate change, precise and comprehensive data on urban trees is necessary, helping to provide different perspectives for urban managers to select appropriate tree species and make policies. © 2020 by the authors.","Biomass allocation; Ecosystem service; Growth pattern; Urban trees","Air quality; Carbon; Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Soils; Available potassiums; Diameter-at-breast heights; Ecosystem services; Growth patterns; Mytilaria laosensis; Natural forests; Terrestrial ecosystems; Urban environments; Urban growth; air quality; carbon cycle; climate change; ecosystem service; growth response; species diversity; urban ecosystem; urbanization; Air Quality; Carbon; China; Ecosystems; Forestry; Growth; Patterns; Trees; China; Guangdong; Hong Kong; Macau; Cunninghamia lanceolata; Mytilaria laosensis; Pinus elliottii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086635984

From the aspects of famine-related migration and the allocation of relief money and grain, the regional interactions in social responses to extreme climate events were analyzed. This paper collected 186 records from historical documents. Regarding the regions as the nodes and the relationships between regions as the links, the spatial patterns of famine-related migration and the allocation of money and grain from 1877 to 1878 were rebuilt. The results show that, firstly, famine-related migration appeared to be spontaneous and short-distanced, with the flow mainly spreading to the surrounding areas and towns.

Herein, we develop a Fe/N co-doped hierarchically structured porous carbon (Fe/N/C-DT) by the dual-templating approach, involving the incorporation of ferrocenecarboxaldehyde (Fc–CHO) into the polyimide, followed by carbonization at 900 °C and etching. A steric hindrance offered by the ferrocene and the porosity of the obtained nanostructure prevent the aggregation of Fe atoms, resulting in the maximization of catalytic efficiency of iron-based sites. FeCl2/N/C-DT and FeSO4/N/C-DT using FeCl2 and FeSO4 as iron sources, respectively, are prepared for comparison, to further confirm the potential positive effect of Fc–CHO and explore the synergistic effect of the pentagon defects and Fe–N4 on the catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The prepared Fe/N/C-DT exhibits outstanding electrochemical activity toward ORR (E1/2 = 0.902 V vs RHE) and impressive OER activity (Ej=10 = 1.66 V) in alkaline conditions.

Here, we present a systematic study of Fe(II) complexes of the functionalized ligands bpyRPY2Me (bpyPY2Me = 6-(1,1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)ethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine) in the pursuit of water-stable molecular Fe complexes that are selective for the catalytic formation of CO from CO2. Taking advantage of the inherently high degree of tunability of this ligand manifold, we followed a bioinspired approach by installing protic functional groups of varying acidities (-H,-OH,-OMe,-NHEt, and-NEt2) into the ligand framework to systematically modify the second coordination sphere of the Fe center. This family of [(bpyRPY2Me)FeII] complexes was characterized using single-crystal X-ray analysis, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Comparative catalytic evaluation of this set of compounds via voltammetry and electrolysis experiments identified [(bpyNHEtPY2Me)Fe]2+ in particular as an efficient, iron-based, non-heme CO2 electroreduction catalyst that displays significant selectivity for the conversion of CO2 to CO in acetonitrile solution with 11 M H2O. We propose that the NH group acts as a local proton source for cleaving the C-O bond in CO2 to form CO. Interestingly, the complex with the most acidic functional group in the second coordination sphere, [(bpyOHPY2Me)Fe]2+, favors formation of H2 over CO. Our results correlate the selectivity of water versus carbon dioxide reduction to the acidity of the second coordination sphere functional group and emphasize the continued untapped potential that synthetic molecular chemistry offers in the pursuit of next-generation CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082528031

The project aims to strengthen formal and informal support structures around the child, through enhancing their village of collaborative support. Understanding the current situation in the region is vital for implementing practice change. This paper aims to gain knowledge regarding the Tyrolean societal and service provision context. Methods: We collected qualitative (17 interviews among stakeholder and people with lived experience) and quantitative data (e.g. health insurance data) regarding overall societal characteristics, epidemiology of mental illness, currently existing services, uptake of services, and current practices and challenges of identifying and supporting COPMIs. We analysed data along eight external context dimensions: 1) professional influences, 2) political support, 3) social climate, 4) local infrastructure, 5) policy and legal climate, 6) relational climate, 7) target population, and 8) funding and economic climate. Results: We identified that there is awareness of potential challenges related to COPMIs at both a professional and planning level. Additionally, there is a lack of installed support processes and standards to meet these children's needs across Tyrol. A variety of services are available both for unwell parents, as well as for families and individual family members. Yet, only one small service addresses COPMIs directly. Services fall into different sectors (education, health, social affairs) and are funded from different sources, making coordination difficult. Access varies from universal to rather restricted (i.e. through referral). The potential number of parents which could be reached in order to identify their children via adult mental health, differs considerably by setting. Societal structures indicate that the informal and voluntary sector may be a realistic source for supporting COPMIs. Conclusions: The societal structures and the current services provide a rich resource for improving identification and support of COPMIs, however considerable coordination and behaviour change efforts will be required due to the fragmentation of the system and professional cultures. The insights into the context of supporting COPMIs have been of high value for developing and implementing practice changes in the local organizations. © 2020 The Author(s).","Children; Context analysis; Implementation science; Mental illness; Situational analysis","adult; Austria; child; child of impaired parents; female; human; male; mental disease; mental health service; middle aged; organization and management; qualitative research; social support; Adult; Austria; Child; Child of Impaired Parents; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Social Support",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083811641

Close to Ouargla city, it is surrounded by an exploited palm groove. In this study, modern climate of Ouargla region updated, surficial geology determined and geochemistry of its brines studied relative to geogenic factors and anthropogenic stress. Mean temperature increased by 2 °C, and thermal amplitude by 1.5 °C. The surficial lithology consists of eolian sand, evaporites and rich-organic matter clay. It is characterized by a rapid vertical and lateral changes which make some areas isolated and others communicating to drainage network and shallow/deep-water springs. This induced the heterogeneity of brines over the chott. The insulate areas show high total dissolved solids (&gt; 230 g/L), high concentration factor (4 ÷ 8), high ionic strength (&gt; 3), high Cl−/SO4 2 ratio (&gt; 2.3) and high Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio (&gt; 3), while the communicating areas present lower values of the same parameters. The diluted brines are Na+ + Mg2+ _sulfate and have undergone an evaporative concentration geochemical process while the concentrated others are Na+ + Mg2+ _chloride and show the cessation of evaporation process. The positive saturation indices reveled the occurrence of vaterite which is confirmed by the results of X-ray powder diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Vaterite formation was possible after the combination of all the necessary reagents, namely presence of calcium, bicarbonate, phosphate, ammonium and carbone dioxide gas. These chemical reagents are provided by organic and mineral pollution. Vaterite formation begins with the presence of ammonium and remains more than 250 h before its transformation to calcite. Its formation sequestered important quantities of carbon dioxide. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Anthropogenic stress; Brines; Crystallization sequence; Evaporative concentration; Global warming; Hyperarid climate; Ouargla basin; Salts; SEM–EDS; Surficial geology; Vaterite; Wastewaters","Ammonium bicarbonate; Calcite; Carbon dioxide; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Geochemistry; Ionic strength; Lithology; Reagents; X ray powder diffraction; Anthropogenic stress; Concentration factors; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Evaporation process; Evaporative concentration; Geochemical process; High ionic strength; Total dissolved solids; Magnesium compounds; anthropogenic effect; arid region; brine; climate change; concentration (composition); environmental disturbance; geochemical survey; global warming; sandy soil; soil pollution; soil temperature; wetland; Algeria; Sahara",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083209956

About 75% global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cause by energy sector and this indicate a major concern to global warming community. In this study, non-supervisory machine learning technique has been used to predict the GHG effect relate to net calorific value based on intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) standard. The study focuses on the characteristic of coal that is used in power generation sector and its chemical effluent that obtained from ultimate analysis (dried basis; Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Sulphur and Ash) as gas emissions is concerned. The dataset shows, coal from different origin and type produce GHG emissions range approximately between 86.95 and 108.23 k-tonne CO2/TJ with the net calorific value of 19.77 to 27.17 MJ/kg-coal. While, for ultimate analysis, the percentage of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Sulphur and Ash are in the range of [65.05 – 73.3], [1.46 – 5.49], [1.2 – 19.06], [0.3 – 1.20] and [4.82 – 15.96] respectively. In this study, principal component analysis is used to screen the training dataset and feed forward structure from artificial neural networks are used which allows the trained model to determine the GHG emission factor based on the given input data. The network relative errors of year 2017 dataset were used to adjust the weight value and as a result, the networks give r-square of 0.91678, which subsequently the trained networks are simulated for GHG emissions prediction for year 2018 at accuracy of r-square 0.82191. Furthermore, the study also shows, they are significant effect from coal characteristic towards GHS emissions and study proposed an optimal solution to simultaneously maximise power generation (in net calorific value per consumption weight) and reducing GHG value (k-tonne CO2/TJ) of coal plant. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

A comprehensive analysis of the urban agglomeration system's carbon emissions is essential to reveal strategies for reduction and support sustainable development. The objective of this research is to develop an integrated carbon emission network model to explore the impact of different energy types on the Northeast Industrial District (NID), China. Four representative energy groups are considered. Specifically, at the aggregated sector-level, this research quantified the relative contributions of socioeconomic factors to carbon emission changes using structural decomposition analysis and examined the system efficiency and redundancy through robustness analysis. At the disaggregated level, the research investigated carbon emissions of different sectors from production-based, consumption-based, and income-based viewpoints. Moreover, emissions from specific categories of final demand and primary input were quantified. It was found that the increase of final demand level will proceed to push up the carbon emissions of the NID. Changing the production structure contributes to reducing emissions. The carbon emissions system has a high redundancy and low efficiency, illustrating that there are many emission pathways within the system. In addition, the use of crude oil significantly increases system redundancy and inhibits system efficiency. However, the major limitation of the model is that the long-term changes of the system are not considered. Moreover, considering the actual policies, emission reduction simulations could be added in the future. © 2020 by the authors.","Different energy types; Input-output analysis; Northeast industrial district; Structural decomposition analysis; Urban agglomeration","carbon emission; climate change; emission control; global climate; industrial agglomeration; input-output analysis; pollution policy; strategic approach; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083574765

This study uses OpenLCA software according to the CML (Center of Environmental Science of Leiden University) 2015 impact assessment method. Results show BIGCC systems’ global warming potential (GWP) is lower than 240 kg CO2-eq/MWh, which is negative when BIGCC systems integrate with CO2 capture and storage technology. Furthermore, the external syngas combustion method has lower GWP, human toxicity potential, and ozone depletion potential than the internal syngas combustion technology, and the Selexol CO2 capture process is cleaner than the MEA CO2 capture method. Moreover, sensitivity analysis illustrates plant construction and energy efficiency have larger impacts on the environmental indicators of BIGCC plants than other parameters. Finally, uncertainty analysis indicates that BIGCC systems have a high potential to reduce the emissions from the mixed electricity grid of European Union of 27 Member States (EU27). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","BIGCC; Biomass gasification; CO2 capture and storage; Life cycle assessment; Simulation","Artificial life; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Gas generators; Gasification; Global warming; Ozone layer; Sensitivity analysis; Synthesis gas; Uncertainty analysis; BIGCC; Biomass Gasification; CO2 capture; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Simulation; Life cycle; bioenergy; combustion; electricity generation; energy efficiency; European Union; global warming; life cycle analysis; ozone depletion; power generation; sensitivity analysis; software; toxicity; uncertainty analysis; Leiden; Netherlands; South Holland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076688228

The degradation of organic compounds of MSW inside the landfill will produce the landfill gas, where the main component is methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are categorized as the greenhouse gas (GHG). These gases if not managed properly will escape and increase the GHG accumulation in the atmosphere. There is many methods has been established and apply to reduce landfill gas emission, but mostly required high investment so not affordable for developing countries. Method that might be applied to reduce GHG emissions from landfill in developing countries is utilization the microorganism to oxidizing CH4 commonly called biocover. The purpose of the study was to analyze the effect of biocover thickness on the oxidation efficiency of CH4 from landfill gas in tropical countries. The concentration CH4 in landfill gas throughout landfill simulator reactor (LSR) covered by 20-60 cm of thick the biocover was measured daily by using the gas analyzer (Sewerin, Multitec 540). The LSR was made of acrylic pipe with a diameter of 25 cm and height of 100 cm. The landfill gas was used has an initial concentration of CH4 approximately 30% and the moisture content of biocover used was maintained at 40%.

Studies have revealed the changes in the concentration of dust and sea-salt removed fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution (DSRPP). However, the spatial characteristics of DSRPP on multiple scales remain unclear. Therefore, we combined the latest global estimates of the PM2.5 dataset and landscape metrics to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of DSRPP across global and national scales from 2000 to 2016. We found that the area of DSRPP increased from 1,146,800 km2 to 3,929,800 km2 between 2000 and 2016, a factor of 2.43. The DSRPP became more structurally fragmented and geometrically complex, with the patch density and the landscape shape index of DSRPP increasing by 133.3% and 24.5%, respectively. More than 90% of the DSRPP were concentrated in the middle income countries, especially in India and China. Specifically, the DSRPP in China exhibited a sprawling process before 2007 but a dissipating process after 2007 under the great efforts of the Chinese government in mitigating air pollution, while DSRPP in India remained an aggregation trend. The potential threat to public health posed by the DSRPP increased over time. Populations living in the areas with the DSRPP increased by 141.2% from 2000 to 2016 due to the deterioration of air quality and demographic change. Thus, we suggest that effective actions should be taken to control the main sources of anthropogenic emissions and mitigate the negative effects of DSRPP on public health in the future, especially in the middle income countries such as China and India. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic activities; Income level; Landscape metric; PM2.5 pollution; Public health; Urban sustainability","Air quality; Deterioration; Dust; Environmental management; Public health; Sustainable development; Anthropogenic activity; Income levels; Landscape metric; Pm2.5 pollutions; Urban sustainability; Health risks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077446444

PM10 (particles smaller than 10 μm) is an important pollutant that could cause various problems. Few studies have researched the spatial heterogeneity of this export-driven pollutant at a high physical spatial resolution, especially given the lack of detailed spatial data based on sectors. Based on the Eora and EDGAR databases, and the MRIO model, this study calculated the export pulled emissions, identified the external driving sources of China's PM10 emissions, visualized the actual internal export-driven PM10 emissions sources and hot spots at a high spatial resolution. China's export-driven and net export-driven PM10 emissions during 1990–2015 generally increased and decreased, respectively, and the net one reversed from positive to negative in 2012. Globally, the external driving sources of China's export-driven PM10 emissions were mostly Latin American and African developing countries/regions and other European developed countries/regions. Nationally, China's export-driven PM10 emissions were mainly from the emission-intensive secondary industries, and the whole emission decreased from southeast to northwest spatially. Emissions hot spots were mostly concentrated on the North China Plain, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and the Sichuan Basin, and they exhibited a polarization phenomenon during 1990–2012. We finally proposed an importer-exporter shared responsibility mechanism to reduce export-driven PM10 emission. These results offer excellent references for China's government to enact targeted export-driven PM10 emissions mitigation strategies. © 2019","China; Export-driven PM10; Hot spots; International trade","Developing countries; Image resolution; International trade; Air pollutant emission; China; Export-driven PM10; High spatial resolution; Hot spot; Polarization phenomena; Shared responsibility; Spatial heterogeneity; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078153668

Due to the anthropogenic forcing (e.g. anthropogenic radiative forcing, et al.), both the climate conditions and EOS greatly changed since 2000, but the relationship between the two remains unclear. To better understand the responses of EOS to climate change with time, we used Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover during 1982–2000 and 2001–2015 separately, aiming to identify and quantify the spatiotemporal distributions of drivers of EOS across different biomes over the NH (&gt;30°). Considering separately these two distinct periods, we found that beginning in the 21st century both the proportion of positive significant pixels (increased by 9.2%) as well as the sensitivity (1.5 ± 4.3 day °C−1 vs. 2.7 ± 7.9 day °C−1) of the temperature vs. EOS relationship had increased. Precipitation affected EOS over a slightly increase area during these two periods, but the sensitivity decreased. Conversely, we found that the sensitivity of EOS to light availability increased for most of biomes, whereas the areas influenced increased by 7.9%. With respect to the sign of relationships between EOS and its drivers, we found that for high latitude regions (i.e., boreal forests and tundra), precipitation advanced EOS during 2001–2015 but delayed EOS during 1982–2000. Although precipitation has significant correlations for a larger area than temperature, its sensitivity was lower. Our results imply that the relative magnitude and sign of drivers of EOS has changed substantially over time and space. Improved representation of these dynamic changes will advance understanding of future climate change on plant phenology by ecosystem models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biome type; Climate change; Northern hemisphere; Spatial and temporal changes; The end of growing season","Atmospheric radiation; Biology; Climate models; Ecosystems; Forestry; Precipitation (meteorology); Anthropogenic forcing; Biome type; End of growing seasons; High-latitude regions; Normalized difference vegetation index; Northern Hemispheres; Spatial and temporal changes; Spatiotemporal distributions; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; autumn; biome; climate change; ecosystem modeling; environmental indicator; EOS; growing season; NDVI; Northern Hemisphere; phenology; satellite altimetry; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078416920

With the world's population expected to reach 10 billion by 2100, and with nearly 90% of people living in urban areas, a critical question for planetary sustainability is how the size of cities affects energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Are urban agglomerations more energy and emission efficient than smaller cities? Does urban agglomeration exhibit gains from economies of scale concerning emissions? Here, we examine the relationship between urban agglomeration and CO2 emissions for urban agglomeration in the Yangtze River Delta in China using a STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) model considering the spatial effects. Also, it examines the influence of economic development, industrial structure, opening-up level, and technology progress on carbon emissions by exploring the spatial agglomeration and spillover effects. Our major finding is that urban size has a negative correlation to carbon emissions, demonstrating that urban agglomeration is more emission efficient. In addition, our results showed that carbon emission driving factors, such as technology progress, opening-up, and population, have spatial dependence and spatial spillover effects. It means a city's carbon emissions are not only influenced by its own factors but also have an impact on neighboring cities. Therefore, cross-city or urban agglomeration policy, and actions of reducing carbon emissions, are necessary, whilst also developing a low-carbon economy by increasing the proportion of high-tech industry through technological progress and developing vigorous resource-saving and an environmentally friendly tertiary industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Spatial effects; Urban agglomeration; Yangtze river delta","carbon dioxide; agglomeration; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; econometrics; economic analysis; greenhouse gas; spatial analysis; sustainability; urban area; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; China; econometric model; economic development; elasticity; energy conservation; human; river; urban area; urban population; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078758712

In order to investigate their effects on methane hydrate production in a low-permeability reservoir, a 3D reservoir model combined with multiple-well systems was established in this study, and long-term numerical simulations of gas production from methane hydrate reservoirs by depressurization were conducted to reveal the complex phenomena of pressure propagation, heat transfer, and gas-liquid two-phase flow in different production systems through 3D visualization. Furthermore, the hot water injection method was also applied in the multiple-well system to examine its effect on gas recovery enhancement. The numerical analyses indicated that the dual-well system had the best performance in gas recovery in a low-permeability reservoir by depressurization, while with the increase in well number, the gas production potential decreased contrarily. In addition, “blind area effect” was found for the first time, which was likely to occur in a low-permeability reservoir when using multiple-well systems (well number > 2) by depressurization. This phenomenon was essentially caused by secondary hydrate formation in the reservoir, which would result in the free gas accumulation in the center region of the vertical wells and thus the decrease in gas production. The hot water injection method could eliminate the blind area effect by preventing secondary hydrate formation and significantly enhance gas recovery in a low-permeability reservoir when using multiple-well systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D visualization; Blind area effect; Low-permeability reservoir; Methane hydrate; Multiple-well system","3D modeling; Acoustic wave absorption; Gas hydrates; Gas industry; Gases; Heat transfer; Hydration; Injection (oil wells); Methane; Offshore gas wells; Offshore oil well production; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Recovery; Secondary recovery; Three dimensional computer graphics; Two phase flow; Visualization; Water; 3D Visualization; Area effect; Gas - liquid two-phase flows; Hot water injection; Methane hydrate productions; Methane hydrates; Multiple wells; Pressure propagation; Low permeability reservoirs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079862756

However, there are social, institutional, and technical barriers to future nuclear expansion. This paper provides an updated assessment of nuclear energy potential in China with analyses at both national and provincial levels and compares results with previous studies. It integrates unit-level information into integrated assessment modelling and scenarios and considers the interactions among different socioeconomic pathways, technology options, climate policies, and social/political concerns on inland siting. Among all factors explored, climate policies have the most significant impact on accelerating nuclear technology deployment. Inland siting of nuclear power plants increases total capacity, but the impact is limited without climate policy. The share of annual nuclear generation across scenarios/studies is unlikely to rise above 11% by 2030 and 30% by 2050 of total Chinese electricity generation. A dramatic increase in total nuclear power generation in China – around 4000 TWh of nuclear generation by 2050 – is only possible in scenarios where China sees electricity demand increase substantially, sticks to and tightens its current Paris Accord commitments, achieves low costs of nuclear technologies, and allows inland siting of nuclear power plants. © 2020","China; Integrated assessment; Nuclear power plants; Provincial-level analysis","Electric power utilization; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; China; Electricity consumers; Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Environmental concerns; Integrated assessment; Integrated assessment modelling; Provincial-level analysis; Nuclear energy; comparative study; electricity supply; environmental policy; integrated approach; nuclear power; nuclear power plant; socioeconomic status; technology adoption; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079560707

Four earth system models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and a process-based ecosystem model are used in this study to assess the impacts and potential risks of the two warming targets on the carbon cycle of China's terrestrial ecosystems. Results show that warming generally stimulates the increase of net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) under both representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The projected increments of NPP are higher at 2 °C warming than that at 1.5 °C warming for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios; approximately 13% and 19% under RCP4.5, and 12.5% and 20% under RCP8.5 at 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming, respectively. However, the increasing rate of NPP was projected to decline at 2 °C warming under the RCP4.5 scenario, and the further 0.5 °C temperature rising induces the decreased NPP linear slopes in more than 81% areas of China's ecosystems. The total NEP is projected to be increased by 53% at 1.5 °C, and by 81% at 2 °C warming. NEP was projected to increase approximately by 28% with the additional 0.5 °C warming. Furthermore, the increasing rate of NEP weakens at 2 °C warming, especially under the RCP8.5 scenario. In summary, China's total NPP and NEP were projected to increase under both 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming scenarios, although adverse effects (i.e., the drop of NPP growth and the reduction of carbon sequestration capacity) would occur in some regions such as northern China in the process of global warming. © 2020 by the authors.","1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming; China; Climate risks; Earth system models of CIMP5; Process-based ecosystem model","carbon balance; climate effect; CMIP; global warming; net ecosystem production; net primary production; terrestrial ecosystem; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083481748

Drawing upon a mixed-methods research approach, this paper explores the progress that has been made by the planning system in England in addressing the challenge of climate change adaptation in coastal urban areas. The results indicate that the adaptation produced through the planning system remains incremental rather than transformative. It is focused on experienced hazards, especially flooding, and there is a lack of attention being paid to wider impacts of climate change, such as rising average temperatures. Furthermore, it was found that the contemporary contribution of planning to climate change adaptation is seriously limited by the government’s emphasis on housing and economic growth and by the development industry’s emphasis on economic viability. © 2019, © 2019 Newcastle University.","adaptation policies; climate change; development management; planning policy; spatial planning","adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; local government; policy approach; policy strategy; spatial planning; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067627980

Most of the farming communities in this area have failed to produce sufficient food and have become dependent on foreign food donations. Yet, the impact, vulnerability and adaptive capacity of the community to climate change in the above-mentioned mountain areas are not well documented. This paper examined the temporal temperature and rainfall trends, and the communities’ vulnerability to climate change as well as their adaptive capacities to the changing climate to fill the existing information gaps regarding issues called forth in the Semien Mountains and other highland environments. Data were gathered using questionnaires, interviews, focus group discussions and field observations. Information from meteorological recordings was also collected for this study. The collected data were analyzed using standardized precipitation index, livelihood vulnerability index, bi-logit model and descriptive statistics. The results confirmed highest climatic variability manifested in rainfall and temperature changes. Rainfall decreased by a total of 573.46 mm (by ≈ 16.38 mm per year on average) from 1979 to 2013. Mean annual temperature increased from 18.54 °C in 1979 to 20 °C in 2013. In this light, majority of the respondents (85%) reported facing climatic hazards. About 70% of them perceive that climate change has decreased land productivity and numerous others (74%) felt its future implications on farmlands. Recurrent crop and animal diseases were indicated by 95.21 and 93.41% of the sampled households, respectively. These climate change-induced incidents were exacerbated by lower adaptive capacities and limited institutional services. Livestock rearing, livelihood diversification, stone bund building, tree planting, organic fertilizer application, selling home articles, soil bund construction, rainwater harvesting, utilizing synthetic fertilizers and preparing hand-dug wells were important adaptive strategies used and ranked 1–10, respectively, by the studied households. Extension services, family size, farm income, access to training and livestock ownership found influential during the use of composting, terracing and tree planting to reduce the negative impact of climate change. Farmer-to-farmer extension appeared to significantly reduce composting, terrace building and tree planting at p < 0.01 level. This calls for further social and cultural related studies to explore the reasons. Climate change adaptation strategies should thus focus on enhancing households’ access to key livelihood assets such as education (training), family size, farm income, extension service, and livestock ownership opportunities. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Ethiopia; Logit model; Mountain community","adaptive management; agricultural land; climate change; fertilizer application; model; mountain region; natural hazard; rainfall; Ethiopia; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062852819

Yet few studies have explored the relevance of changes in underlying gross N2O production and consumption processes toward explaining this phenomenon, in particular for the latter. Furthermore, the microbe-based mechanisms associated with the variation of N2O consumption process remain largely unexplored. To address this knowledge gap, a temperature- (15, 25, and 35°C) and moisture-controlled (50% water holding capacity) microcosm incubation experiment was established using an arable soil subject to long-term addition of synthetic fertilizer (NPK), a mixture of synthetic fertilizer with livestock manure (MNPK), or with no fertilizer treatment (CT). Over the incubation time period, the C2H2 inhibition method was adopted to monitor reaction rates of gross N2O production and consumption; the population sizes and community structures of nosZI- and nosZII-N2O reducers were analyzed using quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). The results indicated that only NPK significantly increased the TS of net N2O emission, and gross N2O consumption process consistently occurred under all treatment combinations (temperature and fertilization) at each sampling time point. The responses of gross N2O production and consumption processes to temperature elevation exhibited fertilization- and sampling time-dependent pattern, and the higher net N2O production TS in the NPK treatment was underlain by its higher TS of gross production process and insensitivity of gross consumption process to temperature. The size and structure of nosZII-N2O reducers, as well as the community structure of nosZI-N2O reducers, were positively correlated with variation of gross N2O production and consumption rates across all fertilization regimes. NosZII-N2O reducer abundance was less responsive to temperature change, and its community structure less susceptible to fertilization, as compared with nosZI-N2O reducers. Overall, our results demonstrate that the TS of the gross N2O production process, not gross consumption, is the key step regulating the TS of net N2O production, and both nosZI- and nosZII-N2O clades are likely active N2O reducers in the tested soil. © Copyright © 2020 Yin, Fan, Yan, Chen, Ye, Ni, Peng, Ran, Zhao, Li, Wakelin and Liang.","C2H2 inhibitor method; fertilization; gross N2O consumption; nosZII; temperature","biological marker; fertilizer; molybdenum; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; soil organic matter; Article; autotrophy; biofilm; community structure; controlled study; correlation analysis; DNA extraction; environmental temperature; livestock; manure; mathematical model; microcosm; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; photosynthesis; physical chemistry; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; restriction fragment length polymorphism; soil fertilization; soil moisture; statistical analysis; temperature; temperature sensitivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084514101

Moreover, there is pressure on the poultry industry to increase production to meet the protein demand of humans and simultaneously reduce emissions to protect the environment. Therefore, improving feed efficiency plays an important role to improve profits and the environmental footprint in broiler production. In this study, using imputed whole-genome sequencing data, genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was performed to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes associated with residual feed intake (RFI) and its component traits. Furthermore, a transcriptomic analysis between the high-RFI and the low-RFI groups was performed to validate the candidate genes from GWAS. The results showed that the heritability estimates of average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and RFI were 0.29 (0.004), 0.37 (0.005), and 0.38 (0.004), respectively. Using imputed sequence-based GWAS, we identified seven significant SNPs and five candidate genes [MTSS I-BAR domain containing 1, folliculin, COP9 signalosome subunit 3, 5′,3′-nucleotidase (mitochondrial), and gametocyte-specific factor 1] associated with RFI, 20 significant SNPs and one candidate gene (inositol polyphosphate multikinase) associated with ADG, and one significant SNP and one candidate gene (coatomer protein complex subunit alpha) associated with ADFI. After performing a transcriptomic analysis between the high-RFI and the low-RFI groups, both 38 up-regulated and 26 down-regulated genes were identified in the high-RFI group. Furthermore, integrating regional conditional GWAS and transcriptome analysis, ras-related dexamethasone induced 1 was the only overlapped gene associated with RFI, which also suggested that the region (GGA14: 4767015–4882318) is a new quantitative trait locus associated with RFI. In conclusion, using imputed sequence-based GWAS is an efficient method to identify significant SNPs and candidate genes in chicken. Our results provide valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms of RFI and its component traits, which would further improve the genetic gain of feed efficiency rapidly and cost-effectively in the context of marker-assisted breeding selection. © Copyright © 2020 Ye, Chen, Zheng, Diao, Teng, Yuan, Zhang, Chen, Zhang, Li and Zhang.","chickens; feed efficiency; GWAS; imputed WGS data; transcriptome analysis","5' nucleotidase; ABI family member 3 binding protein; amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme A; coatomer protein complex subunit alpha; COP9 signalosome; cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C polypeptide 23a; estrone; heat shock protein 90 beta family member 1; inositol polyphosphate multikinase; liver enriched antimicrobial peptide 2; unclassified drug; allele; Article; chicken; controlled study; down regulation; female; food intake; gametocyte; gene expression; gene frequency; genetic association; genome-wide association study; genotype; heritability; male; nonhuman; phenotype; sequence analysis; sex chromosome; single nucleotide polymorphism; transcriptomics; upregulation; whole genome sequencing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083485065

However, a large amount of ammoniacal nitrogen also releases during fermentation, resulting in inhibition of acidogenic process and reduction of carbon source availability. Alkaline fermentation of WAS combined with in-situ ammonia stripping was proposed to improve SCFAs production and carbon source availability simultaneously. The results showed that a maximal SCFAs production of 308.7 ± 4.8 mg chemical oxygen demand/g volatile suspended solid was achieved under the pH = 10 + In-situ ammonia stripping, which was 21.7% and 141.5% higher than that of the pH = 10 and the control, respectively.

In nitrogen-limited waters, the atmosphere can contribute significantly to eutrophication and hypoxia. This is especially true in China, where nitrogen emissions have increased dramatically and are projected to further increase in the future. Here, we modeled the potential future impact of change in atmospheric nitrogen deposition on hypoxia in Chinese coastal seas. We used changes in nitrogen deposition under two IPCC scenarios that included emission regulation and climate change (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5) to evaluate the impacts of such deposition on hypoxia in the 2030s and 2100s. We found that by 2030 the extent of hypoxic areas would increase up to 5% in China seas under RCP 8.5 due to the projected increase in nitrogen deposition. However, the hypoxia extent was projected to decrease by up to 9% by 2100 once emission regulations included in RCP 4.5 and 8.5 are implemented. The South China Sea was found to be the most sensitive region to changes in nitrogen loads, which indicates that more effort in emissions control is needed to avoid expansion of the hypoxic zones in that specific region.

To understand the temporal variations and sources of carbonaceous aerosols, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were measured hourly in suburban Shanghai in 2015–2017 during winter. The average OC concentrations were 7.34 ± 4.51 μgC/m3 in 2015, 7.16 ± 4.43 μgC/m3 in 2016, and 6.4 ± 3.22 μgC/m3 in 2017. The EC concentrations decreased significantly each year, with average concentrations of 3.82 ± 2.43, 2.91 ± 2.28, and 2.46 ± 1.88 μgC/m3, respectively, which caused the OC/EC ratio to increase from 2015 to 2017. Although the meteorological conditions differed each winter, there was a similar pattern of OC and EC diurnal variations, with concentrations peaking at 08:00 and 20:00, largely due to rush-hour vehicle emissions. A downward trend of EC/CO and EC/NO2 (mass ratios) but steady CO and NO2 concentrations from 2015 to 2017 revealed that the characteristics of primary vehicle emissions changed, and that less EC was emitted. Secondary organic carbon (SOC) and primary organic carbon (POC) were estimated with the minimum R2 (MRS) method. The hiemal SOC/OC values in suburban Shanghai were 19.2 ± 18.6% in 2015, 31.1 ± 18.6% in 2016, and 51.0 ± 21.4% in 2017, exhibiting an increasing trend. As the PM2.5 concentration increased (from 0 to 50 μg/m3 to 100–300 μg/m3), a decreasing SOC/OC ratio (from 43.6 ± 23.9% to 21.8 ± 17.7%) was observed over the three years, showing that primary emissions were the main contributors to carbonaceous aerosols on haze days. Case analysis of haze events further demonstrated that the primary sources of OC and EC were vehicle emissions. The contributions of biomass burning and coal combustion to carbonaceous aerosols became less important over the study period. This study highlights the importance of controlling vehicle emissions to reduce carbonaceous aerosol concentrations in the suburbs of the Chinese megacity, Shanghai. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Elemental carbon; Organic carbon; PM2.5; Temporal variations; Vehicle emissions","Aerosols; Coal combustion; Vehicles; Elemental carbon; Meteorological condition; Meteorological effects; PM2.5; Primary organic carbons; Secondary organic carbons (SOC); Temporal variation; Vehicle emission; Organic carbon; carbon; coal; nitric oxide; organic carbon; aerosol; biomass burning; chemical element; coal combustion; concentration (composition); measurement method; meteorology; organic carbon; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution effect; suburban area; temporal variation; traffic emission; winter; adverse event; aerosol; air pollution control; Article; carbonaceous aerosol; circadian rhythm; climate change; exhaust gas; human; measurement accuracy; meteorology; online analysis; priority journal; seasonal variation; secondary organic aerosol; suburban area; winter; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081694794

The synthesized YIG thin films acquire a single garnet structure. The Pt/YIG/Pt stack illustrates unipolar resistive switching behavior with excellent switching uniformity, large memory window (102), stable cycle-to-cycle endurance, and good data storage retention (104 s). The ~46% saturation magnetization variation could be realized via the conversion between high and low resistance states by manipulating the electric field. Schottky emission is governed in the high-field region for the high resistance state. Temperature dependence of resistance and magnetization variation confirms that oxygen vacancies conductive filament model and valence state change (Fe2+ and Fe3+) are responsible for the resistive and magnetization switching mechanisms.

The in situ transmission infrared test was used to study the intermediate products of the catalytic combustion of toluene on Pd-Pt-based catalysts. The results show that CO was produced during the catalytic combustion of toluene on Pd-Pt-based catalysts and adsorbed onto the Pd0 phase by bridge adsorption. Carbon formed via the disproportionation reaction of CO (2CO → C + CO2) on the Pd0 phase was deposited onto the catalysts, leading to carbon deposition. The addition of Pt and CeO2 increased the content of the PdO phase on the catalysts and the oxygen supply performance of the palladium species, thereby promoting the oxidation of CO to CO2, reducing the disproportionation reaction of CO on the Pd0 phase, and inhibiting the formation of carbon deposits.

One of the core problems in constructing the carbon emissions trading market is determining carbon emissions trading prices. The scientific nature of carbon emissions pricing determines the effectiveness of market regulation. Research on the influencing factors and heterogeneous tail distribution of carbon prices can increase the accuracy of carbon pricing, which is particularly important for the development of the carbon emissions trading market. The current studies have some limitations and lack heterogeneous tail description. We employ the arbitrage pricing theory-standardized standard asymmetric exponential power distribution model to analyze China's regional carbon emissions trading price and use a genetic algorithm to solve linear programming. The results confirm the theoretical results and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. First, the new model can capture the skewness, fat-tailed distribution, and asymmetric effects of China's regional carbon emissions trading price. Second, the macroeconomy, similar products, energy price, and exchange rate influence the carbon price fluctuation; investors' behavior plays an important role in the heterogeneous tail distribution of carbon price. The findings provide references for the government to take appropriate measures to promote carbon emission reduction and improve the effectiveness of China's carbon market. Therefore, our findings can help enhance emission reduction and achieve sustainable development of a low-carbon environment. © 2020 by the authors.","China's regional carbon price; Heterogeneous tail distribution; Influencing factors; Standardized standard asymmetric exponential power distribution","carbon emission; emissions trading; environmental policy; exchange rate; genetic algorithm; heterogeneity; pollution tax; price dynamics; state role; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083639794

Breaking administrative boundaries and spatially coordinating ecological resources helps to restructure an ecological compensation mechanism of the region based on the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei. According to the estimated ecological assets in the counties of the region in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015, a quantitative model for total ecological compensation was built based on ecological assets and county-level economic development. Then, the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of the total ecological compensation in the region were defined, and the boundaries of ecological surplus and deficit areas were identified. Results indicate: (1) The region’s annual average ecological assets amounted to ¥1379.47 billion; in terms of annual total ecological assets, Hebei ranked first (¥1123.80 billion), followed by Beijing (¥157.46 billion) and Tianjin (¥98.21 billion); and in terms of ecological assets per unit area, Beijing ranked first, Tianjin second and Hebei last. (2) Among ecosystem services, hydro-logical regulation and climate regulation had the highest annual average value and contributed most to the increase in ecological assets. In 2015, the contribution of water and soil conservation to the total ecological assets decreased to −15.66%, showing the degradation of the function played by different ecosystems. (3) The ecological surplus of the region in four periods of 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 were ¥398.98 billion, ¥870.37 billion, ¥1254.93 billion and ¥2693.94 billion respectively, basically offsetting the ecological deficit of each corresponding period, but the urgency for ecological compensation was increased. (4) The ecological surplus and deficit areas showed a great fluctuation in different time periods. Larger time span means more noticeable convergence of deficit areas towards central and eastern areas. Public resources such as education, transportation and medical care in central urban areas should be decentralized to encourage population dispersal, weaken the agglomeration effect of deficit areas and finally achieve the ecological synergy of the region. © 2020, Science Press Springer-Verlag.","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; coordinated development; equivalent factor; regional eco-compensation; surplus and deficit evaluation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083652021

Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore variations in soil bacterial communities following plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods: An invasive perennial herb, Spartina alterniflora Loisel., was examined via 16S rRNA genetic sequencing analyses, to assess the impacts of plant invasion on soil bacterial communities compared to bare flat and native Suaeda salsa (L.) Pall., Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang, and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. communities in the coastal zone of China. Results: S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased soil bacterial abundance, species richness, and diversity for soil bacterial communities compared with native communities. S. alterniflora soil revealed a unique bacterial community composition, and possessed the highest relative abundance of chemo-lithoautotrophic bacteria, photoautotrophic bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi, and Anaerolineae), and saprophytic and copiotrophic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidetes) among the plant communities. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that invasive S. alterniflora significantly altered soil bacterial abundance, diversity, and community composition through increases in nutrient substrate levels and altering soil physiochemical properties. Subsequently, the modification of soil bacterial communities, especially increased relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Anaerolineae, and Bacteroidetes following S. alterniflora invasion can enhance the degradation of recalcitrant S. alterniflora materials, while inducing the accumulation of soil organic C and N.

In this study, we present a synthetic analysis of particulate constituents during the historically polluted transition period of autumn–winter in 2018, revealing that mixed-type haze episodes are the result of regional transport, homogeneous/heterogeneous conversion, and sandstorm influences. The hydrolysis process of N2O5 at higher relative humidity levels (&gt;70%), which feature an enhanced nitrate oxidation ratio (0.30–0.70) and NO3 − concentration (&gt;60 μg m−3), was the driving factor for high PM2.5 mass concentrations during the observation periods. The long-distance transport of sandstorms, characterized by decreasing PM2.5/PM10 ratios (&lt;30%) from the north/northwest, is the most important factor for the explosive growth of PM10 concentration. These results can help us gain a comprehensive understanding of haze formation and highlight the importance of nitrate chemistry in the aqueous phase. The results suggest that persistent NOx emission reduction measures must be made to better achieve air quality standards in Beijing and the NCP region. © 2019","Emission control; Heterogeneous reaction; Pollution type; Sandstorm","Air quality standards; Emission control; Nitrates; Storms; Heterogeneous reactions; Higher relative humidity; Hydrolysis process; Long-distance transport; Northern China Plains; PM10 concentration; Sandstorm; Synthetic analysis; Air quality; dinitrogen pentoxide; nitrate; atmospheric pollution; autumn; concentration (composition); emission control; haze; heterogeneity; long range transport; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; winter; air pollution; Article; autumn; China; concentration (parameter); dust storm; haze; humidity; hydrolysis; oxidation; particulate matter; physical phase; priority journal; quality control; reduction (chemistry); winter; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076623634

An impediment to enabling deep CO2 reduction to oxygenates and hydrocarbons (e.g., C2+ compounds) is the difficulty of coupling carbon-carbon bonds efficiently. Copper in the +1 oxidation state has been thought to be active for catalyzing C2+ formation, whereas it is prone to being reduced to Cu0 at cathodic potentials. Here we report that catalysts with nanocavities can confine carbon intermediates formed in situ, which in turn covers the local catalyst surface and thereby stabilizes Cu+ species. Experimental measurements on multihollow cuprous oxide catalyst exhibit a C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 75.2 ± 2.7% at a C2+ partial current density of 267 ± 13 mA cm-2 and a large C2+-to-C1 ratio of â&amp;circ;7.2. Operando Raman spectra, in conjunction with X-ray absorption studies, confirm that Cu+ species in the as-designed catalyst are well retained during CO2 reduction, which leads to the marked C2+ selectivity at a large conversion rate.

In the current study, statistical methods (e.g., correlation analysis and Granger Causality Analysis) are used in a systematic analysis of the potential causality of climate variability on migration and armed conflicts. Specifically, the statistical methods are applied to determine the relationships between long-term fine-grained temperature and precipitation data and contemporary social conditions, gleaned from historical documents covering the last two millennia in China's Hexi Corridor. Results found the region's reconstructed temperature to be strongly coupled with precipitation dynamics, i.e., a warming climate was associated with a greater supply of moisture, whereas a cooling period was associated with more frequent drought. A prolonged cold period tended to coincide with societal instability, such as a shift from unification towards fragmentation. In contrast, a prolonged warm period coincided with rapid development, i.e., a shift from separation to unification. The statistical significance of the causality linkages between climate variability, bio-productivity, grain yield, migration and conflict suggests that climate variability is not the direct causative agent of these phenomena, but that climate reduced food production which gradually lead to migration and conflicts. A conceptual causal model developed through this study describes the causative pathway of climate variability impacts on migration and conflicts in the Hexi Corridor. Applied to current conditions, the model suggests that steady and proactive promotion of the nation's economic buffering capacity might best address the uncertainty brought on by a range of potential future climate scenarios and their potential impacts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate variability; Conflict; Food production; Migration; The Hexi Corridor","Chemical contamination; Climatology; Statistical methods; Climate variability; Conflict; Food production; Hexi corridor; Migration; Climate models; air temperature; climate change; correlation; food production; Granger causality test; migration; political conflict; precipitation (climatology); article; causal model; China; climate change; cold stress; controlled study; cooling; correlation analysis; drought; food industry; grain yield; human; human experiment; moisture; precipitation; productivity; social status; statistical significance; uncertainty; war; warming; China; Gansu; Hexi Corridor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077795581

However, the effects of DB-SR on soil bacterial community are still largely unclear. We deciphered soil bacterial community with high-throughput sequencing under various returning approaches, burial depths, and straw amounts after 6.5 years of DB-SR application. Our results showed that DB-SR structured distinctive soil bacterial community with rotary tillage straw return (RT-SR; one-way analysis of similarities [ANOSIM]: P <.01). RT-SR significantly reduced soil bacterial diversity by 3.87%, but DB-SR could maintain it (P >.05). These variations were mainly caused by water content-driven changes in soil organic carbon. Also, bacterial community composition was distinctive among burial depth treatment (one-way ANOSIM: P <.05), and deeper burial reduced species richness and diversity (P <.05). Variation in C/N ratio could mostly explain the alterations in soil bacterial community structure under different burial depths. Moreover, the amount of straw buried had no significant effect on soil bacterial species richness or diversity (P >.05), but bacterial community composition was more dissimilar with increasing straw amount (one-way ANOSIM: P <.01). Our results suggest that long-term DB-SR can maintain the bacterial community structure in the surface soil layers when compared with conventional RT-SR, but taking the current production level into consideration, the burial depth should not be greater than 20 cm for incorporating the full amounts of straws. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","microbial diversity; rice; soil organic carbon; soil water; straw incorporation; wheat double cropping system","Forestry; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Double cropping; Microbial diversity; rice; Soil organic carbon; Soil water; Straw incorporations; Bacteria; bacterium; community composition; conservation tillage; crop rotation; rice; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil water; straw; wheat; Bacteria (microorganisms); Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076911130

Here we compare three distinct global CO2 emissions inventory representations of urban CO2 emissions for five Middle Eastern cities (Riyadh, Mecca, Tabuk, Jeddah, and Baghdad) and use independent satellite observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite to evaluate the inventory representations of afternoon emissions. We use the column version of the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (X-STILT) model to account for atmospheric transport and link emissions to observations. We compare XCO2 simulations with observations to determine optimum inventory scaling factors. Applying these factors, we find that the average summed emissions for all five cities are 100 MtC year−1 (50–151, 90% CI), which is 2.0 (1.0, 3.0) times the average prior inventory magnitudes. The total adjustment of the emissions of these cities comes out to ~7% (0%, 14%) of total Middle Eastern emissions (~700 MtC year−1). We find our results to be insensitive to the prior spatial distributions in inventories of the cities' emissions, facilitating robust quantitative assessments of urban emission magnitudes without accurate high-resolution gridded inventories. ©2020.

A detailed knowledge of sanding process is essential for targeted sand control. This paper aims at investigating the sanding characteristics of weakly consolidated sandstones and unconsolidated sandstones by comparative methods. We conducted sanding experiments on artificial cores of different consolidation degrees and performed numerical studies based on explicit finite element method. We found that hole failure mode, sanding form and the particle size distribution of the produced sand are three typical features distinguishing sand production of weakly consolidated sandstones from that of the unconsolidated ones. Macroscopically, the weakly consolidated sandstones tended to develop localized failure with mainly rock pieces produced while the unconsolidated one failed uniformly with almost loose grains produced. On the particle scale, the sand produced by weakly consolidated sandstone showed better uniformity and lower fine particle content relative to the original sample while the unconsolidated sandstone produced sand with practically the same size as the original core. We suggest that cohesion is the dominant factor that affects sanding characteristics and post-peak strain softening is critical to the simulation of realistic hole failure. The results further reveal the differences of sand production between the two sandstones, and can provide some theory support for the sand production in oil and gas field. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Hole failure; Sand production; Sanding characteristic; Unconsolidated sandstone; Weakly consolidated sandstone","Gas industry; Numerical methods; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Sand; Comparative methods; Comparative studies; Consolidation degree; Explicit finite element method; Production efficiency; Sand production; Sanding characteristic; Weakly consolidated sandstone; Sandstone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079896666

Also, the production cost should be as low as possible for an affordable vehicle. Therefore, it is advantageous for OEMs to develop fuel efficient technologies which can be controlled by software without additional hardware costs. The coasting control is a fuel efficiency improvement technology that can be implemented by the change of vehicle software only. The coasting control is a technology that reduces the driving resistance (Deceleration) when the driver releases the gas pedal. This technology leads to reducing the energy required for the vehicle to drive and results in improving the real-world fuel economy. In an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, the coasting state is achieved by changing the gear to neutral, and the effect has been discussed and clarified by many previous studies. On the other hand, in the coasting state of a hybrid vehicle, the regenerative energy to the motor is reduced while the driver releases the gas pedal. The coasting control of a hybrid vehicle tends to be perceived as deteriorating the fuel efficiency because the regenerative energy decreases. In this study, relations of the vehicle deceleration and the fuel economy (vehicle energy consumption) of a hybrid vehicle were studied quantitatively. In addition, we confirmed that the coasting technology was effective to improve fuel economy (reducing CO2) based on the real-world big data. © 2020 SAE International.

Last decade, several fine particulate pollution episodes occurred in the vast area of China. In response to this, the Chinese government has stepped up efforts to tackle air pollution. In this paper, the temporal trends of PM2.5 and the quantitative potential impact of environmental governance on PM2.5 are analyzed for China. Due to the lack of historical records, a two-stage model was used to estimate the historical PM2.5 concentrations, combined with the newly released satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) product (MODIS Collection 6.1) and other data. The estimated PM2.5 concentrations showed strong consistency with the surface observations. Furthermore, significant seasonal variations existed in the PM2.5 concentrations and the temporal trends were captured, especially in city clusters. Then eight major city clusters were selected as typical samples. All the city clusters showed decrease trends in recent years, with PM2.5 concentrations in these regions decreased by 0.269–1.604 μg m−3 year−1. From 2006 to 2017, the annual PM2.5 concentrations decreased by 7.83%–26.35% in the major city clusters among China. Technological innovation and environmental governance play an important role in the decrease of PM2.5. In order to quantify the influence of governance, environmental regulation intensity and synergy were applied as the indicators of the internal governance and co-governance in each city cluster. In most city clusters, PM2.5 concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with regional internal governance and co-governance (R = −0.596 to −0.930, p &lt; 0.05), and the effect on PM2.5 lasted for several years. However, 1- to 2-year lagged effect was found for governance, which means that the regulatory measures should be enhanced to decrease PM2.5 in the future to achieve the SDGs in China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosol optical depth; Co-governance; Environmental regulation; PM2.5; Spatiotemporal trends; Two-stage model","Aerosols; Optical properties; Pollution control; Sustainable development; Aerosol optical depths; Environmental governances; PM2.5; PM2.5 concentration; Spatiotemporal trends; Surface observation; Technological innovation; Two stage model; Environmental regulations; concentration (composition); environmental risk; governance approach; health impact; health risk; optical depth; particulate matter; public health; satellite data; satellite imagery; aerosol; article; China; human; optical depth; quantitative analysis; seasonal variation; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076616305

This article predicts CO2 emissions based on energy consumption to examine the conditions that would lead to achieving China's goal. In order to better understand the relationship between the two, a simple decomposition model decomposes energy consumption into its quantity and structure. Possible trajectories of CO2 emissions in China to the year 2050 depend on three scenario settings with differing total energy consumption and composition. The results indicate that CO2 emissions will not peak in the business-as-usual scenario. CO2 emissions will peak at 10.69 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2030 in the planned energy structure scenario. In the low-carbon energy structure scenario, the peak will occur in 2025 at the value of 10.37 Gt. Not only do slower energy consumption growth rates and the low carbon energy structure enable this peaking to occur earlier in time but also lower the peaking level. China's fossil energy consumption will also peak in 2030 and 2025 in the respective planned and low-carbon energy structure scenarios. The main policy implication is that China's commitment to a CO2 emissions peak is credible and feasible if they slow energy consumption and shift towards lower-carbon fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emissions peak; China; Energy modernization; Fossil energy; Scenario analysis","Energy policy; Energy utilization; Global warming; Public policy; Carbon dioxide emissions; China; Energy consumption structure; Fossil energy; Fossil energy consumption; International community; Scenario analysis; Total energy consumption; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078837163

In the past decades, the typical winter wheat- summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain (NCP) has produced high yield, but the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer and over-pumping of groundwater for irrigation have caused severe environmental problems. It is necessary to develop climate-smart agricultural systems through a comprehensive multiple-objective assessment and optimization of alternative cropping systems and agronomic managements. Here, with the agricultural system model of APSIM, eight alternative cropping systems at four typical sites across the NCP under two climate change scenarios and two tillage managements were comprehensively evaluated in terms of crop yield, water use efficiency (WUE), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), evapotranspiration (ET), groundwater recharge (GWR), N2O emission, N leaching, surface soil organic carbon (SOC), and carbon footprint (CF). The results showed that under both baseline and future climate scenarios, the currently dominant winter wheat- summer maize rotation system had the largest ET, N leaching and N2O emission, a medium crop yield, WUE, and SOC, however a low NUE, and GWR. The rotation/intercropping systems could have higher grain yields, while the monoculture cropping systems could have advantage on water conservation. Maize had relatively higher yield, WUE, NUE, GWR, and SOC, and lower N loss and CF than wheat and soybean because it could have a high yield without irrigation. The optimized winter wheat-summer maize rotation system, with the optimal irrigation, fertilizer and cultivar, had the greatest advantage over other seven systems with the highest yields, WUE, NUE, high ET, GWR, and SOC, and the lowest N losses and CF. Compared with conventional tillage, each cropping system would have a little bit less negative response to future climate change with conservation tillage. The study demonstrated a useful framework to develop climate-smart agricultural systems and sustainable agricultural strategies to meet the challenges of global climate change, which can be widely applied to other cropping systems and regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate adaptation and mitigation; Climate change; Conservation tillage; Greenhouse gas emission; Nitrogen leaching; Soil organic carbon","conservation tillage; crop rotation; crop yield; cropping practice; evapotranspiration; global climate; leaching; maize; soybean; water use efficiency; wheat; China; North China Plain; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077652611

Strict pollution control actions also reduced the average PM2:5 concentration to the low level of 39.7 ugm-3 in urban Beijing during the winter of 2017. To investigate the impact of such changes on the physiochemical properties of atmospheric aerosols in China, we conducted a comprehensive observation focusing on PM2:5 in Beijing during the winter of 2017. Compared with the historical record (2014-2017), SO2 decreased to the low level of 3.2 ppbv in the winter of 2017, but the NO2 level was still high (21.4 ppbv in the winter of 2017). Accordingly, the contribution of nitrate (23.0 ugm-3) to PM2:5 far exceeded that of sulfate (13.1 ugm-3) during the pollution episodes, resulting in a significant increase in the nitrate-To-sulfate molar ratio. The thermodynamic model (ISORROPIA II) calculation results showed that during the PM2:5 pollution episodes particle pH increased from 4.4 (moderate acidic) to 5.4 (more neutralized) when the molar ratio of nitrate to sulfate increased from 1 to 5, indicating that aerosols were more neutralized as the nitrate content elevated. Controlled variable tests showed that the pH elevation should be attributed to nitrate fraction increase other than crustal ion and ammonia concentration increases. Based on the results of sensitivity tests, future prediction for the particle acidity change was discussed. We found that nitrate-rich particles in Beijing at low and moderate humid conditions (RH: 20 %-50 %) can absorb twice the amount of water that sulfate-rich particles can, and the nitrate and ammonia with higher levels have synergetic effects, rapidly elevating particle pH to merely neutral (above 5.6).

This paper investigated the anti-biofouling efficacy of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) for agricultural emitters used for two types of reclaimed water. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and X-ray diffraction were applied to determine the microbial communities and mineral compositions in biofilms. The obtained results revealed that EMF treatment significantly changed the bacterial communities and reduced their diversities in biofilm by affecting water quality parameters. Network analysis results indicated that EMFs were detrimental to the co-occurrence patterns of mutualistic relationships among bacterial species, destroyed the connectivity and complexity of the networks, and inhibited biofilm formation [decreased total biomass and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content]. EMF treatment could also decrease the deposition of mineral precipitates, reducing the carbonate and silicate content in biofilm. The decrease of EPS content appeared to reduce biofilm-induced mineral crystallization, while the ion precipitations accelerated by EMFs caused an erosive effect on biofilm. The results demonstrated that EMF treatment is an effective, chemical-free, and anti-biofouling treatment method with great potential for biofouling control in reclaimed water distribution systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biofilm; Biofouling control; Electromagnetic field; Microbial community; Mineral precipitation","Biofilms; Biofouling; Electromagnetic fields; Microorganisms; Minerals; Reclamation; RNA; Silicates; Water quality; 16S rRNA gene sequencing; Biofouling control; Co-occurrence pattern; Extracellular polymeric substances; Microbial communities; Mineral precipitation; Reclaimed water distribution systems; Water quality parameters; Water distribution systems; carbonic acid; mineral; RNA 16S; silicate; water; water; biofilm; biofouling; biomass; complexity; connectivity; detection method; electromagnetic field; exopolymer; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial ecology; precipitation (chemistry); water quality; Actinobacteria; Article; Bacteroidetes; biofilm; biofouling; biomass; comparative study; controlled study; cyanobacterium; electromagnetism; environmental parameters; Firmicutes; gene sequence; high throughput sequencing; Janthinobacterium; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; Planctomycetes; polymerization; priority journal; Proteobacteria; Pseudomonas; Rhodobacteraceae; species composition; Sphingomonadaceae; surface tension; Verrucomicrobia; water supply; X ray diffraction; artificial membrane; electromagnetism; water management; Bacteria (microorganisms); Biofilms; Biofouling; Electromagnetic Fields; Extracellular Polymeric Substance Matrix; Membranes, Artificial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Water; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078929596

Despite our knowledge on leakage of additives from products, accurate and rapid approaches to study emission kinetics are largely lacking, in particular, methodologies that can provide in-depth understanding of polymer/additive interactions. Here, we report on a novel approach using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to measure emissions of additives to water from polymer films spin-coated on quartz crystals. The methodology, being accurate and reproducible with a standard error of ±2.4%, was applied to a range of organophosphate esters (OPEs) and polymers with varying physicochemical properties. The release of most OPEs reached an apparent steady-state within 10 h. The release curves for the studied OPEs could be fitted using a Weibull model, which shows that the release is a two-phase process with an initial fast phase driven by partitioning of OPEs readily available at or close to the polymer film surface, and a slower phase dominated by diffusion in the polymer. The kinetics of the first emission phase was mainly correlated with the hydrophobicity of the OPEs, whereas the diffusion phase was weakly correlated with molecular size. The developed QCM-based method for assessing and studying release of organic chemicals from a polymeric matrix is well suited for rapid screening of additives in efforts to identify more sustainable replacement polymer additives with lower emission potential.",,"ester; organophosphate; polymer; silicon dioxide; water; human; quartz crystal microbalance; Esters; Humans; Organophosphates; Polymers; Quartz; Quartz Crystal Microbalance Techniques; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083912998

Based on the core and conventional log data of gas hydrate potential region, the CSMHYD program was adopted to simulate the influences of above three factors on the thickness of the GHSZ. When the gas components of the gas hydrate were CH4, C2H6, and C3H8, with the CH4 percentage ranging from 50% to 100%, the average GHSZ thickness can reach 1000 m according to the forward simulation results. When the gas hydrate was composed of CH4 and one of C2H6, C3H8, H2S, and CO2, the influence order of the above four gases on the thickness of GHSZ is as follows: H2S ＞ C2H6 ＞ C3H8 ＞ CO2. Under the gas components of 90% CH4, 5% C2H6, and 5% C3H8, the thickness of GHSZ decreased rapidly as the geothermal gradient increased following an exponential relation with a correlation of 99.92% and increased slowly as permafrost thickness increased following a linear relation with a correlation of 99.9%. In addition, the thickness of a gas hydrate favorable reservoir was determined by comprehensive log methods as 500 m. We conclude that a reservoir within 500 m below the permafrost layer is favorable for gas hydrate reservoir formation. © 2019 The Authors.

However, these models do not account for crop growth and crop yield, and thus cannot be used for evaluating long-term impacts of climate and management strategies on water use efficiency and farm profitability of agricultural systems while managing the aquifers sustainably. This study presented a linkage between DSSAT, an agronomic model, and MODFLOW, a groundwater flow model. The linkage between these two models occurred on an annual basis, with rates of irrigation and deep percolation from an ensemble of field-scale DSSAT simulations converted to pumping rates and recharge rates for the MODFLOW simulation. MODFLOW simulated groundwater head, which can be used to update saturated thickness and thereby well capacities for each pumping well in the model domain. Simulated well capacities were then used to constrain irrigation applications in the DSSAT simulations during the following growing season. Python scripts were used to convert output from one model to input files for the other model. The DSSAT-MODFLOW modeling system was applied to the Ogallala aquifer underlying Finney County, Kansas, a region experiencing significant groundwater depletion due to irrigation practices, and was tested against observed water table elevation and crop yield. Over a decadal period, well capacity decreased by > 50 % for many pumping wells in the county. A no-irrigation scenario for this same time period resulted in average water table elevation increasing by 2 m, but also a 70 % decline in crop yield. Additional work is needed to balance groundwater conservation with crop yield. The DSSAT-MODFLOW modeling system can be used in regions worldwide to assess changes in irrigation technologies, crop selection, and climate change adaptation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","DSSAT; Groundwater modeling; Integrated modeling; Irrigation; MODFLOW","Aquifers; Arid regions; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Groundwater flow; Hydrogeology; Irrigation; Solvents; Water distribution systems; Well pumps; Arid and semi-arid regions; Climate change adaptation; DSSAT; Groundwater conservation; Groundwater Flow Model; Groundwater modeling; Integrated modeling; MODFLOW; Groundwater resources; climate change; crop yield; flow measurement; flow modeling; groundwater flow; integrated approach; irrigation system; strategic approach; water table; Finney County; Kansas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078948177

Wildfire represents the largest disturbance to these ecosystems. Peatland resilience depends greatly on the extent of post-fire peat soil hydrophobicity. Climate change is altering wildfire intensity and severity and consequently impacting post-fire peat soil chemistry and structure. However, research on fire-impacted peatlands has rarely considered the influence of peat soil chemistry and structure on peatland resilience. Here we characterized the geochemical and physical properties of natural peat soils under laboratory heating conditions. The general trend observed is that hydrophilic peat soils become hydrophobic under moderate heating and then become hydrophilic again after heating for longer, or at higher, temperatures. The loss of peat soil hydrophilicity initially occurs due to evaporative water loss (250 °C and 300 °C for <5 min). Gently but thoroughly dried peat soils (105 °C for 24 h) also show mass losses after heating, indicating the loss of organic compounds through thermal degradation. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to characterize the chemistry of unburned and 300 °C burned peat soils, and various fatty acids, polycyclic compounds, saccharides, aromatic acids, short-chain molecules, lignin and carbohydrates were identified. We determined that the heat-induced degradation of polycyclic compounds and aliphatic hydrocarbons, especially fatty acids, caused dried, hydrophobic peat soils to become hydrophilic after only 20 min of heating at 300 °C. Furthermore, peat soils became hydrophilic more quickly (20 min vs 6 h) with an increase in heat from 250 °C to 300 °C. Minimal structural changes occurred, as characterized by BET and SEM analyses, confirming that surface chemistry, in particular fatty acid content, rather than structure govern changes in peat soil hydrophobicity. © 2020","Chemical characterization; Feather moss; GC–MS analysis; Hydrophilicity; Moisture content; Wildfire","Climate change; Degradation; Ecosystems; Fatty acids; Fires; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gas chromatography; Heating; Hydrocarbons; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Mass spectrometry; Moisture; Peat; Surface chemistry; Wetlands; Aliphatic hydrocarbons; Chemical characterization; Fatty acid contents; Feather moss; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Polycyclic compounds; Short-chain molecules; Wildfire; Soils; aliphatic hydrocarbon; aromatic carboxylic acid; carbohydrate; lignin; long chain fatty acid; organic compound; polycyclic hydrocarbon; chemical composition; gas chromatography; hydrophobicity; mass spectrometry; moisture content; moss; organic compound; peat soil; soil chemistry; wildfire; Article; chemical modification; evaporation; fatty acid analysis; forest fire; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; geochemical analysis; geochemistry; heat treatment; high temperature; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; mass fragmentography; moisture; peatland; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; soil chemistry; soil degradation; soil property; soil structure; taiga; Degradation; Ecosystems; Fatty Acids; Fires; Gas Chromatography; Heating; Water; Wettability; Bryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078145492

China implemented the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) and the air quality has recently achieved remarkable improvement. Objective: To evaluate the associations of variations in annual fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels and changes in life expectancy in Chinese urban populations from 2013 to 2017. Method: We collected annual-average concentrations of PM2.5 and average life expectancy of urban residents in 214 cities from 2013 to 2017. We conducted a longitudinal panel analysis applying linear mixed-effect models to evaluate the association between PM2.5 reduction and life expectancy increase with and without adjustment for socioeconomic and medical-care confounders. Result: The nationwide-average annual PM2.5 concentrations decreased from 67.78 μg/m3 in 2013 to 45.25 μg/m3 in 2017; meanwhile, the average life expectancy of urban residents increased from 78.53 to 79.86 years. A decrease of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 was associated with an increment of 0.18 (95% confidence interval: 0.06, 0.30) year in life expectancy. After simultaneously adjusting for GDP per capita, smoking prevalence, urbanization rate and maternal mortality, the association turned to be insignificant at the national level, but remained significant in the eastern region with life expectancy gained 0.16 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.27) year per 10 μg/m3 reduction of PM2.5. Conclusion: Lower PM2.5 air pollution might be associated with extended life expectancy in east of China. The implementation of APPCAP during 2013 to 2017 might have resulted in benefits on life expectancy, especially in east of China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Accountability study; Air pollution; Life expectancy; PM2.5","Air pollution; Air quality; Particles (particulate matter); Quality control; Accountability study; Air pollution prevention; Annual average concentration; Average life expectancy; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Life expectancies; Mixed-effect models; PM2.5; Air pollution control; accountability; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); life expectancy; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution effect; pollution policy; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; human; life expectancy; medical care; mortality risk; particulate matter; prevalence; priority journal; smoking; socioeconomics; urban area; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077753277

In this study, we used a comprehensive approach to account for area-, production- and biofuel consumption-based emission factor calculation methods, and thus developed an integrated high-resolution emission inventory for 15 types of TEs (As, B, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, V and Zn) originated from natural sources in China for the year 2015. The results show that national emissions of TEs in 2015 range from 7.45 tons (Hg) to 1, 400 tons (Zn) except for the extremely high emissions of Mn (10, 677 tons). SWD and BIO are identified as the top two source contributors, accounting for approximately 67.7% and 26.1% of the total emissions, respectively. Absolute emissions of TEs from natural sources are high in the Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Tibet autonomous regions with large areas of bare soil and desert. However, emission intensity of TEs per unit area in the Southern provinces of China is higher than those in Northern China and Southwestern China, with the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces displaying the highest emission intensity. Our results suggest that controlling SWD can play a significant role in reducing fugitive particulate matter and the associated emissions of TEs from natural sources in China; and desertification control is particularly critical in the Northwest provinces where the majority of deserts are located. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biogenic source; Emission inventory; Natural source; Soil and wind-erosion dust; Spatial distribution; Trace element","Arid regions; Atmospheric spectra; Dust; Erosion; Soils; Spatial distribution; Trace elements; Atmospheric emission; Biogenic source; Emission inventories; High-resolution emission; Natural sources; Quantitative assessments; Tibet autonomous region; Wind erosions; Air pollution; antimony; arsenic; biofuel; boron; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; cosmetic; lead; manganese; mercury; molybdenum; nickel; sea salt spray; selenium; trace element; unclassified drug; vanadium; volatile organic compound; zinc; heavy metal; dust; emission inventory; quantitative analysis; soil erosion; spatial distribution; trace element; wind erosion; air analysis; air pollution; air pollution control; analytical parameters; Article; biofuel production; biogenic source; biomass open burning; China; controlled study; desertification; environmental impact; environmental parameters; geographic distribution; particulate matter; quantitative analysis; soil erosion; spatial distribution; wind erosion; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; Tibet; China; Nei Monggol; Sichuan; Xinjiang Uygur; Xizang; Yunnan; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy; Particulate Matter; Tibet; Trace Elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077741464

Based on an improved Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach model, this study demonstrated regional Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and analyzed regional carbon overdraft situations in China during 2005–2015. Regional carbon allowances were allocated according to carrying capacity of carbon sequestration and China's carbon intensity reduction goals in “13th Five-year plan”. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technology with panel data was further employed to estimate potential benefits resulting from carbon trading and a carbon sink economy. Regional NPP decreased from south to north and from coast to inland, while regions with severe carbon overdrafts were gathered in North and East China. In order to maintain a regional carbon balance with lower abatement costs, regional cooperation of emission reduction within either North or East China is proposed in this study. It is concluded that the majority of provinces and cities in Eastern China and some provinces in the west would be the major purchasers of carbon credits under a national carbon emissions trading (CET) market. Following the introduction of emissions offset mechanisms, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Heilongjiang would be the major providers of carbon sinks in China. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon emissions trading; Carbon sink economy; Data envelopment analysis; Net primary productivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077038837

However, the combined effects of FTCs and increased N availability on GHG fluxes remain unexplored, especially in high-altitude alpine meadows. We conducted an incubation study to investigate the effects of different forms and levels of N additions on soil trace gas fluxes during three FTCs in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Our results showed that the N2O and CO2 emissions as well as CH4 uptake substantially increased during FTCs. N additions generally enhanced the freeze–thaw-related soil N2O emissions but inhibited soil respiration and CH4 oxidation. NO3 –-N additions induced significantly higher cumulative N2O emissions during FTCs than NH4 +-N additions. The soil respiration rates were significantly reduced with increasing levels of N additions and were positively correlated with the soil DOC and MBC contents. Soil CH4 uptake was substantially inhibited by increasing levels of NH4 +-N additions, but was significantly reduced only by high levels of NO3 –-N additions. Our results indicate that N addition plays an important role in affecting soil GHG fluxes during FTCs. The effects of different forms and levels of N additions on soil GHG fluxes should be considered in future estimations of GHG budget in alpine meadows under a changing climate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine meadow; Freeze-thaw cycles; Methane; Nitrogen addition; Nitrous oxide; Soil respiration","Budget control; Freezing; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Thawing; Alpine meadow; Freeze-thaw cycles; Nitrogen additions; Nitrous oxide; Soil respiration; Soils; alpine environment; freeze-thaw cycle; meadow; methane; nitrous oxide; soil chemistry; soil respiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078744774

How to reduce vehicle emissions by effective signal control has become one important research of the urban traffic control. Based on the analysis of vehicle emissions at a single intersection, this paper establishes a signal control optimization model for intersection group with minimum emission target, thus realizing the optimization of vehicle emissions for intersection group. In the model of intersection emission calculation, this paper adopts the emission calculation method based on the intersection parking condition, combined with individual vehicle's parking conditions at the entrance and the corresponding operating conditions to calculate the total emission. In the process of signal control optimization, this paper keeps the phase design and cycle duration in the original signal timing scheme unchanged, only optimizes the green light duration, and uses the genetic algorithm to solve the optimization model to obtain the optimal timing scheme of the intersection group, and one intersection group of Kunshan city was selected for case analysis and evaluation, which proved the effectiveness of the signal control optimization model. © 2020 IEEE.","Intersection group; Traffic signal timing optimization; Vehicle emission","Genetic algorithms; Timing circuits; Traffic signals; Vehicles; Emission calculation; Emission targets; Operating condition; Optimization modeling; Original signal; Single intersections; Urban traffic control; Vehicle emission; Street traffic control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091458059

The Paris Agreement aims to limit the global mean surface temperature increase to less than 2.0 °C relative to pre-industrial levels. China's land area accounts for ∼7% of the global land (65Ñ59S) area, and the arid area of China accounts for 12.41% of the total global arid area. Therefore, the degree of aridification/humidification in China is of great significance to climate change in China and the world. This paper evaluates the regional changes of drylands and humid lands in China based on the 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C increase targets for global mean surface warming(GMSW). We find a suitable warming target for China's climate from the perspective of aridification. The results show the following: 1) If the global mean surface temperature rises by 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C above pre-industrial levels, the mean surface temperature in China will increase by 2.0 °C and 2.8 °C, respectively. 2) Under the two GMSW targets, the degree of drought in some extremely arid areas in China was projected to decrease, which means that these areas may gradually be suitable for human habitation. 3) Regardless of which global surface temperature target is maintained, the humid lands in China will bear greater risks from warming than the drylands. Under these circumstances, the 1.5 °Ctargetwill lead to better outcomes for China than the 2.0 °C target. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Dry and wet area changes; Global warming targets","Arid regions; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Area-changes; Global mean surface temperature; Global surface temperature; Global temperatures; Industrial revolutions; Potential impacts; Pre-industrial levels; Surface temperatures; Surface properties; arid region; assessment method; concentration (composition); global warming; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; surface temperature; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082423133

A rigorous emission control has been implemented by the Chinese government since 2013. It is essential to evaluate changes of air pollutants to understand effectiveness of present air-pollution control on improving air quality. Here, we investigate temporal trends of air pollutants, including PM2.5, SO2, NO2 and O3, observed at 12 sites over the Kunshan area in the Yangtze River Delta region during 2012–2018 using Mann-Kendall statistical test. Overall, significant reduction trends of monthly PM2.5 (−7.4% yr−1) were observed, together with reduction in the PM2.5 to CO ratio (−5.8% yr−1), an indicator of secondary aerosol production. Secondary aerosol precursors, SO2 (−10.3% yr−1) and NO2 (−4.4% yr−1) also presented statistically significant reduction trends. These results reflect the consequence of emission control that leads to substantial reduction in the bulk PM2.5 concentration, as well as secondary aerosols likely formed from SO2 and NO2. However, O3 had statistically significant increase trend (+3.4% yr−1) during 2014–2018. Limited formation of O3 under high PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations condition was found at daytime in summer, which might reflect one of the reasons causing the increase trend of O3 under the current reduction scenario of PM2.5 and NO2. Potential source contribution function analysis demonstrated that the transport from the regions located to northwest of Kunshan could contribute to high concentrations of PM2.5 in all seasons, while the south and southeast could be the high potential as source areas for O3. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air quality; Geographic origins; O3; PM2.5; Trend; Yangtze River Delta",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077714960

As outsourcing has risen, developed countries have been able to decarbonize domestically, at the expense of increased emissions in developing countries. However, the rapid improvement of carbon efficiency in developing regions together with the post-2008 deceleration in international trade raises the question of whether such embodied emission transfers have peaked. Here we update historical analysis, finding that emission transfers between OECD and non-OECD countries peaked in 2006, and have been declining since. The reversal is principally due to the reduction in the emissions intensity of traded goods, rather than the volume of trade. A more recent decline in embodied emissions transfers is also observed in trade between developing countries. We analyse whether these trends are likely to continue, by exploring a baseline and a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) scenario with the Macro-econometric Energy-Environment-Economy Model (E3ME) model. The results suggest that absolute embodied emissions will plateau at current levels or slowly return to pre-2008- crisis levels, and differences between the NDC and baseline scenarios imply that NDC policies will not result in significant carbon leakage. However, the share of national footprint embodied in imports, at least for countries with ambitious decarbonization policies, will likely increase. This suggests that, despite the world-wide stabilization of emissions transfers, addressing emissions embodied in imports will become increasingly important for reducing carbon footprints. Key policy insights Emissions embodied in imports have plateaued since 2006, and are unlikely to return to the peak of the mid-2000s. For developed countries, as domestic decarbonization occurs, the share of emissions embodied in imports as a percentage of the total national carbon footprint will increase. The Paris NDCs in themselves are unlikely to cause significant carbon leakage.

Methods: Diabetes data were derived from the Malaysian National Health and Morbidity Surveys conducted in 2006, 2011 and 2015. The air pollution data (NOx, NO2, SO2, O3 and PM10) were obtained from the Department of Environment Malaysia. Using multiple logistic and linear regression models, the association between long-term exposure to these pollutants and prevalence of diabetes among Malaysian adults was evaluated. Results: The PM10 concentration decreased from 2006 to 2014, followed by an increase in 2015. Levels of NOx decreased while O3 increased annually. The air pollutant levels based on individual modelled air pollution exposure as measured by the nearest monitoring station were higher than the annual averages of the five pollutants present in the ambient air. The prevalence of overall diabetes increased from 11.4% in 2006 to 21.2% in 2015. The prevalence of known diabetes, underdiagnosed diabetes, overweight and obesity also increased over these years. There were significant positive effect estimates of known diabetes at 1.125 (95% CI, 1.042, 1.213) for PM10, 1.553 (95% CI, 1.328, 1.816) for O3, 1.271 (95% CI, 1.088, 1.486) for SO2, 1.124 (95% CI, 1.048, 1.207) for NO2, and 1.087 (95% CI, 1.024, 1.153) for NOx for NHMS 2006. The adjusted annual average levels of PM10 [1.187 (95% CI, 1.088, 1.294)], O3 [1.701 (95% CI, 1.387, 2.086)], NO2 [1.120 (95% CI, 1.026, 1.222)] and NOx [1.110 (95% CI, 1.028, 1.199)] increased significantly from NHMS 2006 to NHMS 2011 for overall diabetes. This was followed by a significant decreasing trend from NHMS 2011 to 2015 [0.911 for NO2, and 0.910 for NOx]. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that long-term exposure to O3 is an important associated factor of underdiagnosed DM risk in Malaysia. PM10, NO2 and NOx may have mixed effect estimates towards the risk of DM, and their roles should be further investigated with other interaction models. Policy and intervention measures should be taken to reduce air pollution in Malaysia. © 2020 The Author(s).","Air pollution; Diabetes; Nitrogen dioxide (NO2); Ozone (O3); Particular matters (PM10); Sulphur dioxide (SO2)","nitric oxide; oxygen; sulfur oxide; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); diabetes; disease prevalence; haze; health risk; health survey; particulate matter; pollution exposure; regression analysis; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollution; ambient air; Article; child; concentration (parameter); diabetes mellitus; disease association; environmental factor; female; human; infant; long term exposure; major clinical study; Malaysian; male; middle aged; newborn; obesity; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; prevalence; priority journal; trend study; young adult; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; diabetes mellitus; environmental exposure; Malaysia; prevalence; very elderly; Malaysia; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Diabetes Mellitus; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Particulate Matter; Prevalence; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083003177

However, with unprecedented human population, environmental degradation, and water scarcity, climatic factors are increasingly invoked falsely to explain failures of environmental governance, a phenomenon termed climatization. We propose a first typology of climatization in hydrology. Scientific climatization occurs when–during the normal course of a scientific investigation–a hydrologic state is falsely attributed to climatic factors, often due to a conceptual model that excludes human impacts or a simplified methodology that fails to quantify uncertainty. In contrast, securitization-aligned climatization occurs when a securitizing state actor requires that scientists attribute observed hydrologic states to climatic factors. Maintaining the credibility of earth science requires that earth scientists vigorously contest both scientific climatization and securitization of global change hydrology. © 2020, © 2020 IAHS.","Anthropocene; climate change; global change; hydrological processes; securitization; strong inference","Climate models; Earth (planet); Hydrology; Anthropocene; Global change; Hydrological process; securitization; strong inference; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate effect; environmental degradation; hydrological regime",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079224243

The degree of its ecosystem services depends on their biological and physical system status. Alternatively, it is one of the most fragile ecosystems and vulnerable to disturbances including climate change. 80 % of the Ayeyarwaddy mangroves was seriously damage by the cyclone Nargis (2008). The study was conducted in Ayeyarwaddy Delta Coastal Zone by adopting transect survey, climate data analysis and reviewing scientific papers and policy documents with two main objectives: understanding climate change, awareness raising on ecosystem and local livelihood status, and enhancing mangrove ecosystem conservation and protection in terms of technology and policy. To recover the mangrove back it took for eight years minimum. Mangrove tree species number is decreasing from 45 to 30 in 37 years. Salinity variation is driving habitat of aquatic fauna species and local livelihoods. Myanmar climate change policy, National Environmental Policy, and Forest Policy become powerful tools to achieve the Nation's sustainable development goal in the context of addressing climate change and the ecosystem protection through institution and technology enhancement.

On this occasion, 329 s of 17.2 nm data of target active region AR 12712 were captured with a cadence of ≈4 s, and a plate scale of 0.″129 pixel-1. Using data captured by Hi-C 2.1 and co-aligned observations from SDO/AIA 17.1 nm, we investigate the widths of 49 coronal strands. We search for evidence of substructure within the strands that is not detected by AIA, and further consider whether these strands are fully resolved by Hi-C 2.1. With the aid of multi-scale Gaussian normalization, strands from a region of low emission that can only be visualized against the contrast of the darker, underlying moss are studied. A comparison is made between these low-emission strands and those from regions of higher emission within the target active region. It is found that Hi-C 2.1 can resolve individual strands as small as ≈202 km, though the more typical strand widths seen are ≈513 km. For coronal strands within the region of low emission, the most likely width is significantly narrower than the high-emission strands at ≈388 km. This places the low-emission coronal strands beneath the resolving capabilities of SDO/AIA, highlighting the need for a permanent solar observatory with the resolving power of Hi-C. © 2020 The Author(s).

The method allows fast computation of spatial emissions using a hierarchical Bayesian framework as an alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The spatial emissions follow a Gaussian process with a Matérn correlation structure which can be represented by a Gaussian Markov random field through a stochastic partial differential equation approach. The inference is based on an integrated nested Laplacian approximation (INLA) for hierarchical models with Gaussian latent fields. Combining an autoregressive temporal correlation and the Matérn field provides a full spatio-temporal correlation structure. We first demonstrate the method on a synthetic data example and follow this using a well-studied test case of inferring UK methane emissions from tall tower measurements of atmospheric mole fraction. Results from these two test cases show that this method can accurately estimate regional greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for spatio-temporal uncertainties that have traditionally been neglected in atmospheric inverse modelling. © 2020 Author(s).",,"algorithm; Bayesian analysis; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; methane; spatiotemporal analysis; trace gas; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084257025

The 3D urchin-like ZnO/Au/g-C3N4 heterostructure provides a rapid Z-scheme charge-carrier transport and collection channel. The characterization of electrochemical impedance and time-resolved photoluminescence confirm that the incorporated Au nanoparticles act as an electron mediator to promote vectorial electron transfer in direct Z-scheme ZnO/g-C3N4 heterojunction.

As the story goes, because each of us tends to dismiss consequences that befall people in other places and in future times, the people cannot be trusted to craft adequate decarbonization policies designed to reduce present-day, domestic carbon emissions. Accordingly, U.S. climate change policy has focused on technocratic fixes that operate predominantly through executive action to escape democratic politics-with vanishingly little to show for it after a change in presidential administration. To help craft a more durable U.S. climate change strategy, this Article scrutinizes the purported incompatibility of decarbonization and democratic politics. It argues that well-designed citizen input and control could advance U.S. efforts to address climate change, rather than hinder them. To foster such input and control, the Article contends that decarbonization can be disaggregated into three distinct questions: (1) whether to decarbonize, (2) how fast to decarbonize, and (3) how to decarbonize. Although people's tendencies to prioritize the present and the local may render them ill equipped to answer the first two questions, the third question, how to decarbonize, is different. That question focuses on the shape we want our economy and communities to take in the decades to come and is thus amenable to more citizen engagement. The Article then traces how more citizen engagement and empowerment on this question of how to decarbonize could advance decarbonization efforts. Across partisan lines, Americans consistently prioritize clean energy to a degree not reflected in our national climate politics, institutions, or energy system. These dynamics suggest that reforms that shift decisionmaking authority away from the energy industry, and into the hands of communities and citizens, have the potential to transform the political economy of decarbonization. After making the case for more citizen control of decisions around how to decarbonize, the Article offers two complementary reforms to help achieve this aim, which venture well beyond the standard administrative law solution set. It proposes that states should: (1) harness the power of public utility law to require utilities to better gauge and respond to their customers' values, and (2) offer communities more control over their energy supply to counteract utilities' economic and political dominance. © 2020 American Statistical Association.

Rewetting is a proven strategy used to protect carbon stocks; however, it can lead to increased emissions of the potent GHG methane. The response to rewetting of soil microbiomes as drivers of these processes is poorly understood, as are the biotic and abiotic factors that control community composition. We analyzed the pro- and eukaryotic microbiomes of three contrasting pairs of minerotrophic fens subject to decade-long drainage and subsequent long-term rewetting. Abiotic soil properties including moisture, dissolved organic matter, methane fluxes, and ecosystem respiration rates were also determined. The composition of the microbiomes was fen-type-specific, but all rewetted sites showed higher abundances of anaerobic taxa compared to drained sites. Based on multi-variate statistics and network analyses, we identified soil moisture as a major driver of community composition. Furthermore, salinity drove the separation between coastal and freshwater fen communities. Methanogens were more than 10-fold more abundant in rewetted than in drained sites, while their abundance was lowest in the coastal fen, likely due to competition with sulfate reducers. The microbiome compositions were reflected in methane fluxes from the sites. Our results shed light on the factors that structure fen microbiomes via environmental filtering. © 2020 by the authors.

Existing studies have mainly focused on carbon emissions caused by local power generation (Scope 1) and carbon emissions embodied in the electricity consumed by a region after cross-regional electricity transmission (Scope 2). Previous studies have ignored the electricity-related carbon emissions induced by regional consumption (Scope 3), leading to carbon emissions leakage. Comprehensively employing the IPCC emissions accounting method, a network approach that simulates cross-regional electricity flow and an environmentally extended input-output model, this study provides systematic electricity-related carbon emissions accounting for regional electricity-related carbon emissions under Scopes 1, 2 and 3 using the case of Shanghai in the period of 2007–2012. The results show that Shanghai has large net inflows of electricity-related carbon emissions through power grids and regional trade, causing Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions to be significantly larger than Scope 1 emissions in Shanghai. A Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model is used to analyze the driving factors of carbon emissions under Scope 1, and the driving factors of carbon emissions under Scopes 2 and 3 are evaluated using structural decomposition analysis (SDA). Fuel structure improvement can help to reduce Shanghai's Scope 1 emission, while the power generation volume increase has opposite effect. Power transmission structure and power transmission scale decrease Shanghai's Scope 2 emissions, while the power consumption scale is positive with emission growth. The declining carbon emissions intensity and improving electricity efficiency offset the growth of Shanghai's Scope 3 emissions, while the increase in population and per capita electricity consumption contribute to the increase in Scope 3 emissions. This study could help to enhance the understanding of regional electricity-related carbon emissions and to support comprehensive and systemic carbon mitigation strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Decomposition analysis; Electricity-related carbon emissions; Multi-scope; Shanghai","Carbon; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Population statistics; Power transmission; Carbon emissions; Decomposition analysis; Electricity efficiencies; Electricity transmission; Electricity-consumption; Multi-scope; Shanghai; Structural decomposition analysis (SDA); Electric power system interconnection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077022680

The main aim of this numerical simulation study is to quantify the magnitude of the effect of adding a fibrous material or a stabiliser in the compressed earth block on the energy requirement or thermal comfort of a building taking into account different operating modes of the cooling system (continuous, intermittent and no cooling) in some climatic conditions in Cameroon. For continuous air-conditioned space and intermittent air-conditioned space, the assessment parameters are cooling load and its peak, while it is thermal comfort index for no air-conditioned space. Thermophysical properties of the used earthen materials were previously measured. The results show that the mixing of sawdust or pozzolan with earth material improves its performances for continuously and intermittent cooling space case, and degrades it for non-air-conditioning space case. It can provide a reduction in peak sensible cooling rate by up to 6.3%, 7% and 10% in Yaoundé, Douala and Garoua, respectively.

Tibetan Plateau and proximal areas have been of utmost interest since the biogeographic relationships and understanding of the depositional environments in the region have remained unsettled during and after the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT). This study derives a first chronostratigraphic framework for Ulantatal, a fossiliferous area in Inner Mongolia, China. Based on paleomagnetic reversal stratigraphy and the constraints of faunal correlations, the time spanned in the strata is between ca. 35 and 27 Ma, thus exposing a long sedimentary succession ranging from the latest Eocene to late Oligocene. The lithological characteristics reveal these extensive fine-grained sediments mainly originate from eolian dust deposition, the onset of which is constrained at the latest Eocene (ca. 34.8 Ma). The presence of post “Mongolian Remodeling” fauna already in the late Eocene of Ulantatal demonstrates unequivocally that the major faunal turnover preceded the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, earlier to what has been recorded from other East Asian localities. The faunal composition predominated by rodents and lagomorphs remains strikingly stable across the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, suggesting the EOT related change in the animal communities was gradual or stepwise rather than abrupt. Moreover, the turnover into this environment dominated by small mammals can be linked with Eocene aridification of Asia, highlighting the dynamic responses of terrestrial systems to changing environment and climate associated with the EOT. © 2020 The Author(s)","Asian aridification; Eocene-Oligocene boundary; eolian dust; magnetostratigraphy; mammalian fossils; Mongolian Remodeling","Deposition; Dust; Lithology; Stratigraphy; Aridification; Eocene-oligocene boundary; Eolian dust; Magnetostratigraphy; mammalian fossils; Mongolians; Mammals; aridification; chronostratigraphy; Eocene-Oligocene boundary; eolian deposit; fauna; fine grained sediment; fossil; magnetostratigraphy; mammal; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; sequence stratigraphy; China; Nei Monggol; Animalia; Lagomorpha; Mammalia; Rodentia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079059990

Because ammonia oxidation is well-studied, tests of CANDO to date have focused on N2O production in anaerobic/anoxic sequencing batch reactors. In these reactors, nitrogen is provided as nitrite; PHA is produced from acetate or other dissolved COD, and PHA oxidation is coupled to N2O production from nitrite. In a pilot-scale study, N2O recovery was affected by COD/N ratio, total cycle time, and relative time periods for PHA synthesis and N2O production. In follow-up bench-scale studies, different reactor cycle times were used to investigate these operational parameters. Increasing COD/N ratio improved nitrite removal and increased biosolids concentration. Shortening the anaerobic phase prevented fermentation of PHA and improved its utilization. Efficient PHA synthesis and utilization in the anaerobic phase correlated with high N2O production in the anoxic phase. Shortening the anoxic phase prevented reduction of N2O to N2. By shortening both phases, total cycle time was reduced from 24 to 12 h. This optimized operation enabled increased biomass concentrations, increased N2O yields (from 71 to 87%), increased N loading rates (from 0.1 to 0.25 kg N/m3-d), and shorter hydraulic residence times (from 10 to 2 days). Long-term changes in operational performance for the different bioreactor systems tested were generally similar despite significant differences in microbial community structure.

However, there is little guidance available in design standards when the steel grade exceeds 690 MPa. Such guidance is needed, because the use of thinner plate elements than would normally be encountered in mild steel members leads to an increased importance in local plate buckling participating in the strength limit state, and its interaction with yielding and residual stresses that are germane to HSS members. This paper investigates the buckling strength of welded HSS I-beams numerically, and based on the results of the study it proposes a corresponding strength design criterion that incorporates local buckling and lateral-torsional buckling and their interaction at the ultimate limit state. The finite element model used for the analysis is based on ABAQUS software, and it incorporates the interaction of elastic buckling, yielding, residual stresses induced by welding and geometric imperfections. The numerical formulation is validated against test results reported by several investigators, and it is then used to produce a substantive set of data to investigate the buckling strength of welded HSS beams. It is shown that the buckling strength depends primarily on two parameters: the generalised (or member) slenderness and the section slenderness. It is also demonstrated that coupled modes of failure are possible for slender sections that incorporate the interaction of local and lateral-torsional modes, which traditionally are treated simplistically in current steel design standards by using effective section properties. To overcome the limitations on guidance for the strength design of HSS beams, a set of new strength design equations are proposed from the numerical data, based on the generalised and section slendernesses. © 2019","Coupled buckling; Finite element modelling; High-strength steel (HSS); Lateral-torsional buckling; Local buckling; Welded I-Section beam","ABAQUS; Buckling; Finite element method; High speed steel; Residual stresses; Strength of materials; Welding; Coupled buckling; Finite element modelling; I-sections; Lateral-torsional buckling; Local buckling; High strength steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081165186

Herein, a fundamental investigation of unfolding intrinsically superior edge-ND trapped atomic Fe motifs (e-ND−Fe) relative to an intact center model (c-ND−Fe) in ORR electrocatalysis is reported. Density functional theory calculations reveal that local electronic redistribution and bandgap shrinkage for e-ND−Fe endow it with a lower free-energy barrier toward direct four-electron ORR. Inspired by this, a series of atomic Fe catalysts with adjustable ND−Fe coordination are synthesized, which verify that ORR performance highly depends on the concentration of e-ND−Fe species.

Using agricultural waste-generated synthetic fuels can reduce emissions both from vehicles and biomass burning. To estimate the potential benefits of synthetic diesel in Beijing, the emission factor model for the Beijing vehicle fleet was applied to estimate exhaust emissions for the 2015–2030 period. Compared with 100% petroleum diesel, a 20% synthetic diesel blend reduced diesel fleet emissions by 24% for carbon monoxide, 30% for total hydrocarbons, 5.5% for nitrogen oxides, and 19% for fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) while using 100% synthetic diesel decreased emissions by 36% for carbon monoxide, 48% for total hydrocarbons, 10% for nitrogen oxides, and 34% for PM2.5. The use of biomass for producing synthetic fuels rather than burning in the field also reduces air pollution. Over 60 g of PM2.5 agricultural open-field burning emissions are avoided per liter of synthetic fuel produced.

In contrast, this study examines whether increasing carbon emissions accelerate eco-innovation using data from China. The mediating role of environmental regulation is also considered as regulations are the most prominent factors discussed in the eco-innovation literature, and they may be mainly caused by environmental changes. Therefore, based on 532,808 Y02 patents for technologies that mitigate or adapt to climate change—used as a proxy for eco-innovation—and panel data from 30 Chinese provinces for 2004–2016, a regression method is used to estimate a new theoretical framework for determining the carbon emissions, environmental regulation, and eco-innovation link. The results show that increasing carbon emissions lead to accelerated eco-innovation, implying climate change creates opportunities for Chinese innovators. Moreover, carbon emissions are found to have a positive impact on environmental regulation—an issue never empirically studied before. Furthermore, the impact of carbon emissions on eco-innovation is partially mediated by environmental regulation. Specifically, command-and-control and market-based regulation initiated by the Chinese government play mediating roles between carbon emissions and eco-innovation, but voluntary regulation from the public does not play the same role. These direct and mediating roles are further confirmed by the estimation of different categories of environmental technology. Among these technological areas, carbon treatment technologies, Y02C, are the most indirectly impacted from carbon emissions through environmental regulation, but the least directly impacted. By contrast, opposite results are obtained for Y02T technologies, associated with transport. Based on these findings, we suggest that command-and-control and market-based regulation, rather than voluntary regulation, be strengthened to transfer environmental pressure for innovators in China. Moreover, these environmental regulations should be applied more to immature and promising low-carbon technologies such as Y02C. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; CPC-Y02; Eco-innovation; Environmental regulation","Carbon; Climate change; Commerce; Environmental technology; Patents and inventions; Regression analysis; Carbon emissions; CPC-Y02; Eco-innovation; Environmental change; Environmental innovations; Environmental pressures; Low-carbon technologies; Theoretical framework; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076518374

Most published adsorption kinetics of a solid amine sorbent have been measured using thermogravimetric analysis experiments (TGA) or adsorption columns, which can include additional diffusion limitations and tend to underestimate the adsorption uptake rates. In this study, the CO2 adsorption kinetics on a solid amine sorbent are measured by a novel microfluidized bed thermogravimetric analysis (MFB-TGA) method, which can achieve real-time weight measurement of a solid amine sorbent in a fluidizing state with similar mass and heat transfer characteristics in a fluidized bed reactor. The experimental data from MFB-TGA is analyzed with a reactor model, and the effects of the gas exchange between the bubble phase with the emulsion phase and the gas diffusion around solid amine sorbent particles on the adsorption uptake rate are evaluated. The apparent adsorption kinetics are described by a two-stage model of the linear driving force model (LDF). The effects of the particle size, temperature, and CO2 concentration on the apparent adsorption kinetics of a solid amine sorbent in the MFB-TGA are investigated and compared with that measured by regular TGA. It is observed that the adsorption of CO2 on a solid amine sorbent in the initial stage is fast, and after the initial fast stage, a second slower stage takes place, resulting in slower adsorption rates. CO2 adsorption on a solid amine sorbent in the initial stage is very fast, and the adsorption rate can approach 0.2 mmol/g/s. Additionally, the adsorption rate constants do not change with temperature or CO2 concentration, and the adsorption process is first order on CO2 concentration. This developed MFB-TGA provides a new method for measuring fast adsorption kinetics occurring inside a fluidized bed reactor.

Accurate and effective monitoring of their soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) stocks provides important information for soil quality assessment, sustainable forestry management and climate change policy making. In this study, a geographical weighted regression (GWR) model, a multiple stepwise regression (MLSR) model, and a boosted regression trees (BRT) model were compared to obtain the best prediction of SOC and STN stocks of the forest ecosystems in northeastern China. Five-hundred and thirteen topsoil (0-30 cm) samples (10.32 kg m-2 (±0.53) for SOC, 1.21 kg m-2 (±0.32) for STN), and 9 remotely-sensed environmental variables were collected and used for the model development and verification. By comparing with independent verification data, the best model (BRT) achieved R2 = 0.56 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 00.85 kg m-2 for SOC stocks, R2 = 0.51 and RMSE = 0.22 kg m-2 for STN stocks. Of all the remotely-sensed environment variables, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are of the highest relative importance in predicting SOC and STN stocks. The spatial distribution of the predicted SOC and STN stocks gradually decreased from northeast to southwest. This study provides an attempt to rapidly predict SOC and STN stocks in the dense vegetation covered area. The results can help evaluate soil quality and facilitate land policy and regulation making by the government in the region. © 2020, by the authors.","Digital soil mapping; Remote sensing data; Soil organic carbon stocks; Soil total nitrogen stocks; Spatial variation","Climate change; Forecasting; Forestry; Mean square error; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soil quality; Vegetation; Boosted regression trees; Climate change policies; Environmental variables; Geographical weighted regressions; Multiple stepwise regression; Normalized difference vegetation index; Root mean square errors; Soil quality assessments; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084267734

The series spans five redox levels (34-38 e-/cluster core), allowing for a detailed investigation into both the degree of metal-metal interaction and the extent of ligand-based redox-activity. Magnetometry, electrochemistry, UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy, and crystallography were used in conjunction with DFT computational analyses to extract the electronic structures of the six homodinuclear complexes. The isoelectronic, 34 e- species [(3PDI2)Fe2(PMe3)2(μ-Cl)](OTf) and [(3PDI2)Co2(PMe3)2(μ-Cl)](OTf)3 exhibit metal-metal single bonds, with varying amounts of electron density delocalization into the ligand as a function of the effective nuclear charge of the metal ions. One-and two-electron reductions of [(3PDI2)Co2(PMe3)2(μ-Cl)](OTf)3 lead to isolable products, which show successive increases in both the Co-Co distances and the extent of reduction of the ligand manifold. This trend results from reduction of a Co-Co σ∗ orbital, which was found to be heavily mixed with the redox-active manifold of the 3PDI2 ligand. A similar trend was observed in the 37 and 38 e- dinickel complexes [(3PDI2)Ni2(PMe3)2(μ-Cl)](OTf)2 and [(3PDI2)Ni2(PMe3)2(μ-Cl)](OTf); however, their higher electron counts lead to high-spin ground states that result from occupation of a high-lying δ/δ∗ manifold with significant Ni-NPDI σ∗ character. This change in ground state configuration reforms a M-M bonding interaction in the 37 e- complex, but formation of the 38 e- species again disrupts the M-M bond alongside the transfer of electron density to the ligand. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073235336

China's power sector needs to achieve large-scale emission reductions through CCS technologies to contribute to limiting the global temperature rise to less than 2℃. The best source–sink matching directly affects total mitigation costs for the power sector. However, China has not yet established an optimal CCS plan. This study evaluates the least-cost source–sink relationship and cluster development opportunities for CCS in China under the 2 °C constraint. The results show that 165 existing coal-fired power plants, which have an installed capacity of approximately 175 GW, need CCS retrofitting and can find a suitable CO2 storage site within an average radius of 115 km. The total captured CO2 is 17.42 billion tons in Northeast, North, East, Northwest, and South regions with the share of 10.79% (1.88 GtCO2), 31.29% (5.45 GtCO2), 35.25% (6.14GtCO2), 22.39% (3.90GtCO2), and 0.27% (47MtCO2), respectively. Approximately 90% of captured CO2 can be stored in the Songliao, Bohai Bay, and Subei basins. In addition, 23% of the emission reductions can be achieved through CO2-enhanced oil recovery.

However, its effect on N2O emissions from paddy soil and the associated microbial mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, wheat straw was amended to two paddy soils (2% w/w) from Taizhou (TZ) and Yixing (YX), China, which were flooded and incubated for 30 d. Real-time PCR and Illumina sequencing were used to characterize changes in denitrifying functional gene abundance and denitrifying bacterial communities. Compared to unamended controls, straw addition significantly decreased accumulated N2O emissions in both TZ (5071 to 96 mg kg-1) and YX (1501 to 112 mg kg-1). This was mainly due to reduced N2O production with decreased abundance of major genera of nirK and nirS-bacterial communities and reduced nirK and nirS gene abundances. Further analyses showed that nirK-, nirS- A nd nosZ-bacterial community composition shifted mainly along the easily oxidizable carbon (EOC) arrows following straw amendment among four different soil organic carbon fractions, suggesting that increased EOC was the main driver of alerted denitrifying bacterial community composition. This study revealed straw return suppressed N2O emission via altering denitrifying bacterial community compositions and highlighted the importance of EOC in controlling denitrifying bacterial communities. © 2020 FEMS.","denitrifying bacteria; easily oxidizable carbon; nitrous oxide; paddy soil; straw return","abundance; agricultural soil; bacterium; community composition; denitrification; microbial community; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; paddy field; soil fertility; soil organic matter; straw; China; Jiangsu; Taizhou; Yixing; Zhejiang; Bacteria (microorganisms); Triticum aestivum; carbon; nitrous oxide; China; denitrification; microbiology; soil; Carbon; China; Denitrification; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083623982

The Theil index is used to explore the sources of the provincial gap of green water use inefficiency, and a random-effect panel Tobit model is applied to test the impact of the influencing factors of green water use inefficiency in the YREB. It is found that green water use inefficiency of the YREB is relatively low and regional differences is significant during the sample period, indicating a large potential of water-saving and water pollution reduction, and narrowing BGAP and WGAP of the Upstream is the key for improving green water use inefficiency in the YREB. The panel Tobit regression results show that economic development, technological innovation, water use structure, water resources endowment, environmental regulation and regional differences all play positive/negative effects on green water use inefficiency in the YREB, while these factors' influencing direction, degree and significance are significantly different.

Continuous changes in climatic conditions have altered precipitation patterns in most regions of China. Droughts become more frequent and severe in the Xi River basin in South China. It is expected that rapid urbanization and climate change will continue to aggravate water stress in this region. There is an urgent need to develop sustainable water management strategies in face of growing water demand and changing water availability. Projection of future climate change impacts on drought conditions has thus become imperative to support improved decision-making in sustainable water management. In this study, we assessed the risk of extreme droughts under future climate projections in the Xi River basin. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model was applied to simulate the hydrological processes of the basin under a multitude of future climate scenarios from CMIP5. Based on the precipitation and runoff series obtained from the VIC model, a comprehensive analysis with respect to the major characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts had been carried out. This study is of practical and theoretical importance to both policymakers and scholars. First, this study may be a readily available reference work for policymakers when taking consideration of building drought mitigation plans into future water management practices. Second, the findings in this study may provide some valuable insights into the inherent connection between climatic and hydrological changes under a changing climate. Recognition of the connection and interrelation may contribute to the improvement of climatic and hydrological models in practices. © Copyright © 2020 Wang, Niu, Li and Zhou.","drought risk analysis; hydrological processes; regional climate change; variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model; Xi River basin","Climate models; Decision making; Drought; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Rivers; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Comprehensive analysis; Future climate projections; Future climate scenarios; Hydrological droughts; Precipitation and runoff; Precipitation patterns; Sustainable water management; Variable infiltration capacity models; Climate change; climate change; climate conditions; drought; future prospect; hydrological response; regional climate; water stress; China; Guangdong; Liuxi Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083894975

In addition to alert the public for health concerns, accurate ozone prediction is also crucial to understand the formation mechanisms of surface ozone episodes, and has significant implications for making emission control strategies of ozone precursors such as methane, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds. However, existing methods of ozone concentration prediction could not effectively capture temporal dependency, and most neglect spatial correlations. In this study, a hybrid sequence to sequence model embedded with the attention mechanism is proposed for predicting regional ground-level ozone concentration. In the proposed model, the inherent spatiotemporal correlations in air quality monitoring network are simultaneously extracted, learned and incorporated, and auxiliary air pollution and meteorological information are adaptively involved. The hourly data collected from 35 air quality monitoring stations and 651 meteorological girds in Beijing, China are used to validate the present model. The results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal correlations in the monitoring network present enormous advantages for the regional ozone prediction. Auxiliary data and time lags matching day-of-week or diurnal periods of ozone are confirmed to benefit the improvement of prediction accuracy. Monitoring stations in urban areas exhibit better prediction performances than stations in remote areas. The addressed model outperforms the baseline models, and is proven to have excellent performance in all monitoring station categories of Beijing and different months with significant disparity of ozone concentrations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality monitoring network; Deep learning; Ozone prediction; Sequence to sequence model; Spatiotemporal correlation","Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Climate change; Emission control; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Monitoring; Ozone; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality monitoring networks; Air quality monitoring stations; Ground level ozone concentration; Meteorological information; Ozone prediction; Prediction performance; Sequence modeling; Spatiotemporal correlation; Deep learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077357692

Based on this, the factors of air leakage around the roadway and borehole are analyzed. The effect of extraction time, seal length and air leakage on the gas concentration is discussed by the fluid-solid coupling model, which is proved by the borehole environmental parameter instrument.The research findings show :(1) Influenced by roadway excavation and drilling, a large number of cracks are created inside the coal around the roadway and the boreholes, which are the main air leakage channels for the air to flow from roadway into borehole; (2) Inside the borehole, the closer it is to the bottom of the borehole, the fewer the cracks in the coal seam, the higher the gas concentration. The critical point of air leakage in which the gas concentration is 100 % moves continuously to the bottom of the borehole with extraction time, until it is stable. The effective sealing length must exceed the position of critical point of air leakage; (3) The gas concentration is related to the sealing length and the amount of air leakage. Increasing the sealing length, and reducing the air leakage can greatly improve the extraction efficiency. Based on the above results, combined bag-type segmented grouting technique, which is to inject different sealing materials into different regions divided by the stress, is proposed to block the air leakage channel by comparing the crack characteristics of the coal surface in the abnormal stress zone and the normal stress zone by SEM technology. According to the field test results, the application of the new sealing technology blocks the crack channel, improves gas concentration and reduces the risk of coal and gas outburst. The results have important guiding significance for improving gas utilization rate, reducing greenhouse gas emission and enhancing safety in production. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Air leakage; Gas drainage; Sealing depth; Sealing technique","Boreholes; Coal; Coal deposits; Extraction; Gas bursts; Greenhouse gases; Sealing (finishing); Air leakage; Environmental parameter; Extraction efficiencies; Gas drainage; Guiding significances; Prevention and controls; Risk of coal and gas outbursts; Sealing technique; Air",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078141333

Soil samples from three layers (0–10, 10–30 and 30–60 cm, respectively) were collected from adjacent EBFs, TPs and MBPs in An'ji County, Zhejiang Province, China. The physico-chemical properties of soils, including bulk density, SOC and its different fractions were determined. The chemical composition of SOC was also measured using 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The results showed that conversion from EBFs to TPs and MBPs decreased the concentrations of water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), light and heavy fraction organic carbon (LFOC, HFOC) and humus carbon (HC) (P &lt; 0.05), reduced the O-alkyl C and carbonl C content, but increased the alkyl C, Aromatic C, aromaticity and the ratio of alkyl C/O-alkyl C (A/O-A) (P &lt; 0.05). These results suggested that intensive management markedly altered the chemical structure of SOC and labile carbon pools. Our results demonstrated that converting EBFs to TPs and MBPs had a negative effect on SOC content and a positive effect on SOC stability.

Pt is an excellent cocatalyst that is widely used in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, however, its effects on the forward and back reactions have not been clearly clarified. Here, Pt modified hexagonal tungsten oxide (h-WO3) is prepared and the role of Pt is investigated based on the performance of CO2 reduction and its back reactions behavior. Appropriate amount of Pt modification proves not only to improve charge separation and transfer efficiency, but also to enhance CO2 adsorption and activation ability. Therefore, Pt modified h-WO3 promotes forward reactions of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO and CH4.

This study firstly measured the total amount and the intensity of agricultural carbon emissions (i.e., agricultural carbon emission per capital) in China. The results show that China's total carbon emission in 2016 was 272.022 million tons, which is 26.67% more than that in 2000, with an average annual increase of 1.67%. It then compared the regional differences of agricultural carbon emissions in China using the method of coefficient of variation and the Theil index. Following this, this paper finally provides scientific and technological support for the reduction of agricultural carbon emissions in China based on a matrix of carbon emission reduction strategies. © 2020 by the authors.","Agricultural carbon emissions; Analysis of regional differences; Intensity of carbon emissions; Strategy for carbon emission reduction","carbon emission; emission control; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083588690

Various changes have been made in England to reduce the global impact of its MSW management, but the effectiveness of these changes on mitigating the global warming potential (GWP) from MSW management has never been investigated in detail. This study assessed the historical GWP of MSW management in Nottingham throughout the period from April 2001 to March 2017 through life cycle assessment (LCA). The LCA results indicate continuous reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from MSW management during the study period due to improvements in waste collection, treatment and material recycling, as well as waste prevention. These improvements resulted in a net reduction of GHG emission from 1076.0 kg CO2–eq./t of MSW (or 498.2 kg CO2–eq./Ca) in 2001/02 to 211.3 kg CO2–eq./t of MSW (or 76.3 kg CO2–eq./Ca) in 2016/17. A further reduction to −142.3 kg CO2–eq./t of MSW (or −40.2 kg CO2–eq./Ca) could be achieved by separating food waste from incinerated waste, treating organic waste via anaerobic digestion and by pretreating incinerated waste in a material recovery facility. © 2019","EU waste directives; Evolution; Global warming potential; Life cycle assessment; Municipal solid waste; Nottingham","Anaerobic digestion; Carbon dioxide; Facilities; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Oil field equipment; Evolution; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Nottingham; Waste directives; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076693065

The role played by the 2-fluorocyanoester additives on battery performance was explored by linear sweep cyclic voltammetry, NMR, GCMS, and XPS techniques. For all fluorocyanoester additives studied, initial reduction of the carbonyl group occurs which is then followed by formation of the corresponding radical anion. Possible degradation routes arising from loss of fluoride ion, loss of methyl radicals, and cleavage of the αβ carbon-carbon bond were observed, and all affect battery performance. Electrode protection upon addition of fluorocyanoesters to the electrolyte is the main contribution to the improvement of battery stability, but improvements on the electrode protection are somewhat offset by free radical processes initiated at the anode.

To address this gap, we present in situ measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2 ), nitrous oxide (N2 O), and methane (CH4) emissions from the lowlands of southern Kenya. We conducted eight chamber measurement campaigns on gas exchange from four dominant land-use types (LUTs) comprising (1) cropland, (2) bushland, (3) grazing land, and (4) conservation land between 29 November 2017 and 3 November 2018, accounting for regional seasonality (wet and dry seasons and transitions periods). Mean CO2 emissions for the whole observation period were the highest by a significant margin (p value&lt;0.05) in the conservation land (75±6 mgCO2 Cm-2 h-1) compared to the three other sites, which ranged from 45±4 mgCO2 Cm-2 h-1 (bushland) to 50±5 mgCO2 Cm-2 h-1 (grazing land). Furthermore, CO2 emissions varied between seasons, with significantly higher emissions in the wet season than the dry season. Mean N2 O emissions were highest in cropland (2:7±0:6 μgN2 O-Nm-2 h-1) and lowest in bushland (1:2± 0:4 μgN2 O-Nm-2 h-1) but did not vary with season. In fact, N2 O emissions were very low both in the wet and dry seasons, with slightly elevated values during the early days of the wet seasons in all LUTs. On the other hand, CH4 emissions did not show any significant differences across LUTs and seasons. Most CH4 fluxes were below the limit of detection (LOD, ±0:03 mgCH4-Cm-2 h-1). We attributed the difference in soil CO2 emissions between the four sites to soil C content, which differed between the sites and was highest in the conservation land. In addition, CO2 and N2 O emissions positively correlated with soil moisture, thus an increase in soil moisture led to an increase in emissions. Furthermore, vegetation cover explained the seasonal variation in soil CO2 emissions as depicted by a strong positive correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and CO2 emissions, most likely because, with more green (active) vegetation cover, higher CO2 emissions occur due to enhanced root respiration compared to drier periods. Soil temperature did not show a clear correlation with either CO2 or N2 O emissions, which is likely due to the low variability in soil temperature between seasons and sites. Based on our results, soil C, active vegetation cover, and soil moisture are key drivers of soil GHG emissions in all the tested LUTs in southern Kenya. Our results are within the range of previous GHG flux measurements from soils from various LUTs in other parts of Kenya and contribute to more accurate baseline GHG emission estimates from Africa, which are key to reducing uncertainties in global GHG budgets as well as for informing policymakers when discussing low-emission development strategies. © Author(s) 2020.",,"flux measurement; gas exchange; greenhouse gas; land use change; lowland environment; savanna; soil emission; terrestrial ecosystem; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084151644

To this extent, trade implications and competitiveness effects have been of prime concern to energy and climate policy makers. In this study, we employ the GEM-E3 hybrid CGE model to quantify the regional and sectoral trade impacts of climate mitigation scenarios. In line with the Paris Agreement, we assess a global implementation of NDCs and a global mitigation action consistent with the 2°C target. The scenarios differ in both effort sharing and mitigation stringency, yet we find a reduction of global trade activity under both policy regimes. The key driver is the sharp decline of global demand for fossil fuels. Fossil fuels, a highly traded good, are substituted by domestically produced goods like electricity or by capital equipment that is traded with lower intensity. Decarbonization policies have an important impact on trade flows, affected by the relative stringency of action and the key characteristics of the regional economies. We identify regions that benefit from the emergence of new markets for clean energy goods, contrary to the fossil-fuel exporters, as well as regions that achieve a comparative advantage due to their preparedness from early mitigation action. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate policy; Competitiveness; Low-carbon transition; Macroeconomic impacts; Paris agreement; Trade","Commerce; Competition; Fossil fuels; Climate mitigations; Climate policy; Comparative advantage; Competitiveness; Domestically produced; Energy and climate policies; Low-carbon transitions; Macroeconomic impact; Climate models; assessment method; carbon; competitiveness; economic impact; environmental policy; fossil fuel; macroeconomics; trade flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079889216

However, there is a need for improved understanding of their long-term resilience. The Arctic hotspot of Ringhorndalen has the highest registered diversity of vascular plants in the Svalbard archipelago, including several remarkable and isolated plant populations located far north of their normal distribution range. Here we analyze a lake sediment core from Ringhorndalen for sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) and geochemical proxies to detect changes in local vegetation and climate. Half of the plant taxa appeared already before 10,600 cal. yr BP, indicating rapid colonization as the ice retreated. Thermophilous species had a reoccurring presence throughout the Holocene record, but stronger signal in the early than Late Holocene period. Thus, thermophilous Arctic plant species had broader distribution ranges during the Early Holocene thermal maximum c. 10,000 cal. yr BP than today. Most of these thermophilous species are currently not recorded in the catchment area of the studied lake, but occur locally in favourable areas further into the valley. For example, Empetrum nigrum was found in >40% of the sedaDNA samples, whereas its current distribution in Ringhorndalen is highly restricted and outside the catchment area of the lake. Our findings support the hypothesis of isolated relict populations in Ringhorndalen. The findings are also consistent with main Holocene climatic shifts in Svalbard identified by previous studies and indicate an early warm and species-rich postglacial period until c. 6500 cal. yr BP, followed by fluctuating cool and warm periods throughout the later Holocene. © 2020 The Authors","Ancient DNA; Biodiversity hotspot; Holocene; Lake sediments; Metabarcoding; SedaDNA; Svalbard; Vegetation dynamics","Biodiversity; Catchments; DNA; Lakes; Normal distribution; Runoff; Sediments; Vegetation; Ancient dnas; Holocenes; Hot spot; Lake sediments; Metabarcoding; SedaDNA; Svalbard; Vegetation dynamics; Population distribution; air-soil interaction; biodiversity; catchment; colonization; DNA; Holocene; lacustrine deposit; sediment core; vegetation dynamics; Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Empetrum nigrum; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081031770

Market cost constraints as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings thresholds imposed by the European Commission however limit the potential use of pellets. A spatially explicit assessment of import potentials of both pellets and torrefied pellets, based on the growing stock of forestry biomass in the US, Canada, Brazil, Russia and Baltic States, was combined with an analysis of supply chain costs and emissions in order to analyse potentials as limited by different levels of costs and emission constraints. Results show that in case of GHG savings thresholds of 70%, 80% and 85% the total import potential is reduced to 61 to 24 and 1 Mt, respectively. The potential for torrefied pellets is larger in all cases, 44 Mt in the case of an 80% limit. Import potentials at cost limits of 200, 175, 150 and 125 €/t are reduced from 58 Mt to 52, 38 and 9 Mt pellets, respectively, with little difference between pellets and torrefied pellets.

The proposal extends the burden-sharing framework designed in 2008. This new burden-sharing, called by the European Commission as the Effort Sharing Regulation, is based on a GDP per capita rule and aims to reflect the economic capacity of each European Member State on the basis of its relative wealth. However, several papers have pointed out that this way of allocating emissions can result in great cost-inefficiencies, as the allocations do not take Member State abatement costs into account. The proposal acknowledges this issue and proposes a range of flexibility instruments (i.e., more than 15 flexibility options) that intend to enhance cost-effectiveness. This paper evaluates the proposal and analyzes the economic impacts of each flexibility option with respect to fairness and cost-effectiveness using a computable general equilibrium model. The performed analysis demonstrates that flexibility mechanisms that allow “inter-Member state flexibility” constitute the most efficient options. Specifically, they reduce compliance costs and, simultaneously, increase fairness between low-income Member States and high-income Member States. © 2019, Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Climate policy; Computable general equilibrium model; Effort Sharing Regulation; European Union",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077034126

However, few recommendations exist on how to diversify farm systems in ways that best fit the agroecological and socioeconomic challenges farmers face. Farmers' ability to adopt diversification strategies is often stymied by their aversion to risk, loss of local knowledge, and limited access to agronomic and market information, this is especially the case for smallholders. We outline seven steps on how practitioners and researchers in agricultural development can work with farmers in decision-making about on-farm diversification of cropping, pasture, and agroforestry systems while taking into account these constraints. These seven steps are relevant for all types of farmers but particularly for smallholders in tropical and subtropical regions. It is these farmers who are usually most vulnerable to climate change and who are, subsequently, often the target of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) interventions. Networks of agricultural innovation provide an enabling environment for on-farm diversification. These networks connect farmers and farmer organizations with local, national, or international private companies, public organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and research institutes. These actors can work with farmers to develop diversified production systems incorporating both high-value crops and traditional food production systems. These diversified farm systems with both food and cash crops act as a safety net in the event of price fluctuations or other disruptions to crop value chains. In this way, farmers can adapt their farm systems to climate change in ways that provide greater food security and improved income. © Copyright © 2020 van Zonneveld, Turmel and Hellin.","agroecosystem diversification; climate variability; climate-smart agriculture; crop diversification; diversified farming systems; on-farm diversification; participatory research; risk management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083902683

The influences of soil texture, compaction, soil moisture and the resulting air filled porosity on the gas permeability were researched by performing pressure loss experiments on two loamy sands, currently in use as methane oxidation layer material. These experiments mimicked the influence of the intrinsic soil properties, the construction method (compaction) and the local climate (soil moisture) on the soils’ permeability. In both soils, effective and specific permeability were strongly impacted by the level of soil compaction, whereas increasing moisture contents had little effect in one of the soils, only reducing effective permeability when a certain threshold was exceeded. In the other soil, structure-forming processes induced by the addition of water led to an increase in both effective and specific permeability with increasing moisture. It is concluded that the spatial spread of the landfill gas in the gas distribution layer is predominantly affected by texture and compaction of the overlying methane oxidation layer. In terms of methane oxidation system design, the choice of material and construction method have more impact on gas permeability than seasonal changes in soil moisture in moderate climates. Furthermore, air filled porosity on its own is not adequate to estimate the effective permeability of loamy sand for methane oxidation layers. Further research should address the estimation of effective gas permeability based upon soil texture, bulk density and soil moisture combined. © 2020","Air filled porosity; Compaction; Methane oxidation; Permeability; Soil moisture; Soil texture","Biogas; Compaction; Gases; Land fill; Methane; Oxidation; Porosity; Soil mechanics; Soil moisture; Textures; Air-filled porosities; Construction method; Effective permeability; Gas distribution; Methane oxidation; Moderate climate; Seasonal changes; Specific permeability; Gas permeability; methane; water; bulk density; compaction; methane; oxidation; permeability; porosity; soil mechanics; soil moisture; Article; bulk density; climate change; effective permeability; environmental impact; gas; Germany; land use; landfill; Netherlands; oxidation; pore size distribution; porosity; priority journal; seasonal variation; soil compaction; soil moisture; soil property; soil texture; water content; water retention; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; permeability; sand; soil; waste disposal; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction; Permeability; Refuse Disposal; Sand; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083084033

Both the conventional indirect DME synthesis and the improved direct DME synthesis process are constrained by thermodynamics, which results in limited product yield, extensive separations and large recycle streams. Sorption enhanced DME synthesis is a novel process for the production of DME. The in situ removal of H2O ensures that the oxygen surplus of the feed no longer ends up in CO2 as is the case for direct DME synthesis. As a result CO2 can be converted directly to DME with high carbon efficiency, rather than being the main byproduct of DME production. The sorption enhanced DME synthesis process is a promising intensification, already achieving over 80 % single-pass CO2 conversion for a non-optimized system. The increased single-pass conversion requires less downstream separation and smaller recycle streams, especially for a CO2-rich feed. A key optimization parameter for the process performance is the adsorption capacity of the system. This capacity can be improved by optimizing the reactive adsorption conditions and the regeneration procedure. In this work, a detailed modelling study is performed to investigate the impact of various process parameters on the operating window and the interaction between different steps in a complete sorption enhanced DME synthesis cycle, and to compare its performance to other direct DME synthesis processes. The development of sorption enhanced DME synthesis, with its high efficiency carbon conversion, could play a significant role in the energy transition in which the carbon conversion will become leading. © 2020 The Authors.","Abbreviations ADS adsorption step; BD blowdown (depressurization) step; CCUS carbon capture, utilization and storage; CZA copper/zinc oxide/alumina; DMC dimethyl carbonate; DME dimethyl ether; EOS equation of state; LTA Linde Type A; PSA pressure swing adsorption; REP repressurization step; rWGS reverse water-gas shift; SEDMES sorption enhanced DME synthesis; TSA temperature swing adsorption; WGS water-gas shift","Alternative fuels; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ethers; Recycling; Sorption; Thermodynamics; Adsorption capacities; Dimethyl ether synthesis; Downstream separation; Energy transitions; Optimization parameter; Process parameters; Process performance; Reactive adsorption; Conversion efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089425495

Previously identified microbial indicators of hydrocarbon toxicity were used to understand interactions between hydrocarbon concentrations, soil physicochemical parameters and the microbial community. Despite the complexity of the field sites, which included active fuel storage areas with high levels of soil heterogeneity, multiple spill events and variable fuel sources, we observed consistent microbial community traits associated with exposure to high concentrations of hydrocarbons. These included; reductions in alpha diversity, inhibition of nitrification potential and a reduction in the ratio of oligotrophic to copiotrophic species. These observed responses and the sensitivity of microbial communities in the field, were comparable to sensitivity estimates obtained in a previous lab-based mesocosm study with hydrocarbon spiked soils.

In urban environments, on-road black carbon concentrations have a large spatial variability, suggesting that the personal exposure of a cyclist to black carbon can heavily depend on the route that is chosen to reach a destination. In this paper, we describe the development of a cyclist routing procedure that minimizes personal exposure to black carbon. Firstly, a land use regression model for predicting black carbon concentrations in an urban environment is developed using mobile monitoring data, collected by cyclists. The optimal model is selected and validated using a spatially stratified cross-validation scheme. The resulting model is integrated in a dedicated routing procedure that minimizes personal exposure to black carbon during cycling. The best model obtains a coefficient of multiple correlation of R=0.520. Simulations with the black carbon exposure minimizing routing procedure indicate that the inhaled amount of black carbon is reduced by 1.58% on average as compared to the shortest-path route, with extreme cases where a reduction of up to 13.35% is obtained. Moreover, we observed that the average exposure to black carbon and the exposure to local peak concentrations on a route are competing objectives, and propose a parametrized cost function for the routing problem that allows for a gradual transition from routes that minimize average exposure to routes that minimize peak exposure. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Air quality; Black carbon; Land use regression; Routing","black carbon; carbon; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; combustion; concentration (composition); environmental indicator; environmental monitoring; land use change; numerical model; pollution monitoring; regression analysis; routing; spatial variation; urban area; air pollution; air quality; Article; combustion; cycling; cyclist; human; k nearest neighbor; land use; priority journal; random forest; support vector machine; urban area; air pollutant; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; soot; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076243384

Peat compaction by loading and peat oxidation by groundwater level lowering are two important processes contributing to shallow subsidence in cultivated peatlands, causing an overall increase in soil wetness over time and hence a lower soil-bearing capacity and agricultural production. Peat oxidation also causes emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses. Rigorous monitoring techniques are urgently needed to spatially and temporally map the amount and rate of subsidence and to monitor effects of measures to reduce subsidence and its negative impacts on livestock farming and agriculture. Monitoring shallow subsidence in peatlands is particularly challenging, because subsidence is a slow and spatially complex process, with average rates in the order of mmyr1 but with higher rates possibly occurring on shorter timescales. The desired monitoring system must be able to capture this temporal and spatial variability, and preferably the contribution of different processes to total subsidence. The system needs to be applicable (technically- and financially-speaking) at regional scales, without severely impacting daily farming activities. To help design and test a subsidence monitoring system for cultivated peatland areas, four methods to measure subsidence are applied and assessed in a cultivated peatland in Overijssel (NL), namely spirit levelling, extensometery, LiDAR, and InSAR. In this paper, we focus on the levelling and extensometery methods and measurements. Subsidence was measured since October 2018 at eight livestock farms once every three months by levelling. In the same period, extensometers have measured vertical movement of (sub)surface levels hourly at two livestock farms. In addition, phreatic groundwater levels are continuously monitored. Preliminary results show vertical movements (up and down) in the order of centimeters on the timescale of weeks. These movements seem to be related to groundwater level fluctuations, but also evapotranspiration is expected to contribute to additional subsidence during the summer period. Because long term net subsidence is a slow process, additional data collection is needed to assess the different methods and the temporal and spatial fluctuations in subsidence on longer timescales. This is vital information to design the optimal method for monitoring subsidence in cultivated peatlands on large spatial scales, and to help in selecting effective measures to reduce subsidence and greenhouse gas emission in peatlands. ©Author(s) 2020.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Peat; Subsidence; Wetlands; Agricultural productions; Farming activities; Groundwater level fluctuation; Monitoring techniques; Soil bearing capacity; Subsidence monitoring; Temporal and spatial; Temporal and spatial variability; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088232209

A scattered group of 10–20 commercial wastewater injection wells dispose off produced water from oil and gas wells in the region, utilizing a sequence of stacked deep saline formations for injection zones. These wastewater injection wells provide practical benchmarks for understanding the feasibility of carbon dioxide (CO2) storage. Geologic models were developed based on characterization data from the wastewater injection wells. Reservoir simulations were calibrated according to injection testing and operational data from the wastewater injection wells. Long-term operational data on injection flow rates and pressures measured in the wastewater injection wells were especially useful to evaluate the performance of carbon storage applications. The simulations were used to estimate injection pressures, radius of CO2 saturation, and pressure response for industrial scale CO2 storage applications. Results were also used to provide a design basis in terms of number of injection wells, well spacing, area of review, injection system components, monitoring plan, and CO2 pipeline distribution system. The analysis demonstrates that there is sufficient injectivity in the deep saline formations in the west-central Appalachian Basin to store commercial volumes of anthropogenic CO2.

Herein, the effect of light with different wavelengths and intensities on nonprecious transition-metal catalysts with photoabsorption abilities was explored for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methane. Illuminating Co10/CeO2 with blue light (450-460 nm) during the reaction invoked a 116% enhancement in catalyst activity with high selectivity to CH4 (94%) at 300 °C. The improvement was assigned to the direct activation of adsorbed reaction intermediates by photogenerated hot electrons on the Co surface. Additionally, the hot electrons may contribute to oxygen vacancy generation in the CeO2 support which acts as localized charge density sites. An improved performance was also obtained for Cu10/CeO2 under green light (560-570 nm) illumination with a 48% enhancement in CO2 conversion and approximately 100% CO selectivity at 450 °C, which was attributed to a localized surface plasmon resonance effect by the Cu nanoparticles. To further elucidate the role of light in boosting catalyst performance, the effect of different metals and supports (Ni10/CeO2 and Co10/Al2O3) was examined. The superior performance observed for CeO2-based catalysts was attributed to the intrinsic oxygen vacancies in CeO2. The work demonstrates that catalysts having light absorption characteristics can potentially offset part of the thermal energy requirements of energy intensive reactions.

The conventional methods of heavy metal removal from wastewater have some drawbacks, ranging from generation of sludge to high cost of removal. Adsorption technique for copper(II), zinc(II), and chromium(VI) using activated carbon has been found efficient. However, it is not economical on a large scale. This, therefore, necessitates the search for economical and readily available plant biomass-based activated carbons for the sequestration of the metal ions. This review presents the state of the art on the adsorption of copper(II), zinc(II), and chromium(VI) from industrial wastewater. Based on the literature review presented, the groundnut husk and corncob based activated carbons were found to possess the maximum adsorption capacities for copper(II), zinc(II), and chromium(VI) removal, when compared with the other plant biomass-based activated carbons. The high values of the adsorption capacities obtained were as a result of the isotherms and pH of the adsorbent as well as the initial concentration of the metal solutions. From the review, the equilibrium data fitted better with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms than with other isotherms. Research gaps were identified which include a need to investigate the kinetic and the thermodynamic behaviors of the metal ions onto the studied adsorbents. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the three types of activation of the adsorbents should be investigated using single and multi-metals. The optimization of particle size, contact time, temperature, initial concentration, and adsorbent dosage for adsorption of copper(II), zinc(II), and chromium(VI) onto the studied adsorbents using response surface methodology is equally required. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Plant biomass; Sequestration; Wastewater","Activated carbon; Activation analysis; Adsorption; Biomass; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Copper compounds; Heavy metals; Isotherms; Metal ions; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Wastewater; Zinc compounds; Corncob-based activated carbons; Industrial wastewaters; Initial concentration; Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms; Plant biomass; Response surface methodology; Sequestration; Thermodynamic behaviors; Chromium compounds; activated carbon; chromium; copper; zinc; charcoal; copper; heavy metal; zinc; activated carbon; adsorption; biomass; carbon sequestration; chromium; copper; pollutant removal; removal experiment; wastewater treatment; zinc; adsorption; biomass; concentration (parameter); contact time; corncob; heavy metal removal; industrial waste; isotherm; maize; particle size; peanut; pH; plant biomass; response surface method; Review; seed husk; temperature; waste water; adsorption; biomass; environmental monitoring; isolation and purification; kinetics; water management; Adsorption; Biomass; Charcoal; Chromium; Copper; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Metals, Heavy; Waste Water; Water Purification; Zinc",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082055895

Changes in surges have exhibited different oscillatory components from the intermonthly (∼3–6-months) to the interannual scales (∼1.5-years, ∼2–4-years, ∼5–8-years) with mean explained variances of ∼40% and ∼25% of the total variability respectively. The correlation between the multiresolution components of surges and 28 exceptional stormy events with different intensities has revealed that energetic events are manifested at all timescales while moderate events are limited to short scales. By considering the two hypotheses of (1) the physical mechanisms of the atmospheric circulation change according to the timescales and (2) their connection with the local variability improves the prediction of the extremes, the multiscale components of the monthly extreme surges have been investigated using four different climate oscillations (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea-Level Pressure (SLP), Zonal Wind (ZW), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)); results show statistically significant correlations with ∼3–6-months, ∼1.5-years, ∼2–4-years, and ∼5–8-years, respectively. Such physical links, from global to local scales, have been considered to model the multiscale monthly extreme surges using a time-dependent Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The incorporation of the climate information in the GEV parameters has considerably improved the fitting of the different timescales of surges with an explained variance higher than 30%. This improvement exhibits their nonlinear relationship with the large-scale atmospheric circulation. © 2020","Climate oscillations; Extreme surges; Multiresolution analysis; Multiscale variability; Sea level; Storms","air-sea interaction; annual variation; climate oscillation; extreme event; general circulation model; image resolution; sea level change; storm surge; English Channel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080047094

Standard accounting of emissions counts the ‘territorial’ emissions that occur within a country, but there has also been discussion about the need for ‘consumption-based’ carbon accounting (CBCA) that counts the carbon emissions required to produce the goods and services consumed in a country (in short: the Country Carbon Footprint (CCF)). Global multi-regional input-output (GMRIO) databases form the method of choice to calculate carbon footprints. Due to the need to combine different data sources to construct GMRIOs, and incompleteness and inconsistencies in data sources, estimations and balancing procedures have to be applied. Such construction procedures are not uniform. This leads to hesitation over using CCF results in policy formulation. The empirical analysis reviewed in this paper synthesizes the few simple measures that can already lead to robust CCF results, even with different GMRIO models. The single most important point is to use harmonized territorial carbon emissions in different GMRIO models. Then, differences between databases for most countries are less than 10% between GMRIOs, and considerably lower than 10% for large countries with a high GDP compared to imports. When investigating the trends in CCF as opposed to the absolute value, the differences become even smaller. Hence, harmonizing data already used in classical production-based accounts and related policy making appears to be the most relevant factor also for CBCA and calculating CCFs. Key policy insights Country Carbon Footprints (CCFs) are best calculated with Global Multi Regional Input Output (GMRIO) databases. Compared to territorial carbon accounting, the additional use of GMRIOs for calculating CCFs in principle leads to higher uncertainties. However, trends in CCFs–that is, relative change over time–calculated with different GMRIOs are already very robust. Harmonizing territorial emissions across GMRIOs is the single most important factor that reduces uncertainty in CCFs, followed by the use of an official national Environmentally Extended Input-Output model for the country for which a CCF is calculated. Working towards an internationally accepted GMRIO, such as the OECD’s inter-country input-output (ICIO) table, is recommended. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Not only do these effects pose risks to children's health, safety and survival in the near term, their younger age means they will be exposed to the increasing consequences into the future and for a greater proportion of their lives. As such, children are often presented in climate change debates, research and practice as being especially vulnerable and in particular need of support. However, this can lead to the portrayal of children as passive victims. This paper provides an overview of adaptation research and practice literature concerning children and young people, with a particular focus on whether and how child-centred responses to climate change can contribute to building the resilience of households and communities. In light of the increasing recognition of the roles of children and young people in climate advocacy, it is timely to consider how to more effectively include children in climate change adaptation action more broadly, and the consequences for them and their communities. © 2020 Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience.",,"article; child; climate change; household; human; victim",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091700443

Despite growing urban green areas, only a few studies have quantified A of urban trees and assessed their dynamical changes with varying atmospheric conditions. Hence, we investigated A in nine dominant tree species in a new park of Bangkok. Results: Results revealed that A of two tree species (Millingtonia hortensis and Afzelia xylocarpa) significantly increased with vapor pressure deficit (VPD) until it reached a maximum and declined when VPD decreased, with no seasonal difference. Five of them (Dalbergia cochinchinensis, Tabebuia rosea, Lagerstroemia floribunda, Dipterocarpus alatus and Bauhinia purpurea) exhibited different response patterns of A to VPD between wet and dry seasons. In contrast, the A of two tree species (Samanea saman and Homalium tomentosum) did not respond to changing VPD in either season. Conclusions: Comparing planting scenarios of insensitive (i.e. no response to VPD) versus sensitive (i.e. significant response to VPD) species, we found that planting a mixture of sensitive and insensitive tree species would improve the park's capacity of A across seasons, allowing climate change adaptation to adverse environmental impacts such as droughts and the urban heat island effects, and would increase biodiversity. Additionally, planting insensitive tree species would significantly increase the capacity of the park for CO2 mitigation. These findings are useful for those who design parks and expand urban green areas to fully benefit ecosystem services from trees. © 2020 The Author(s).","Carbon dioxide absorption; Stomatal conductance; Urban trees","absorption; angiosperm; biodiversity; carbon dioxide; climate effect; deciduous tree; ecosystem service; evergreen tree; greenspace; heat island; photosynthesis; quantitative analysis; stomatal conductance; tree; urban area; vapor pressure; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Thailand; Afzelia; Bauhinia purpurea; Dalbergia cochinchinensis; Dipterocarpus alatus; Homalium tomentosum; Lagerstroemia floribunda; Samanea saman; Tabebuia rosea; carbon dioxide; city; ecosystem; heat; photosynthesis; season; Thailand; tree; Carbon Dioxide; Cities; Ecosystem; Hot Temperature; Photosynthesis; Seasons; Thailand; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083365374

This progress report categorizes various Cu-based electrocatalysts into four main groups, namely metallic Cu, Cu alloys, Cu compounds (Cu + non-metal), and supported Cu-based catalysts (Cu supported by carbon, metal oxides, or polymers). The detailed mechanisms for the selective CO2RR are presented, followed by recent relevant developments on the synthetic procedures for preparing Cu and Cu-based nanoparticles. Herein, the potential link between the Cu surface and CO2RR performance is highlighted, especially in terms of the chemical states, but other significant factors such as defective sites and roughened morphology of catalysts are equally considered during the discussion of current studies of CO2RR with Cu-based electrocatalysts to fully understand the origin of the significant enhancement toward C2 formation.

However, Borana pastoral households have not been passive victims; rather, they have demonstrated significant capabilities to respond to their changing environment through technical and institutional innovations. This paper examined Borana pastoral households’ adaptive responses to deal with contemporary climate and sociopolitical variations and factors determining households’ adaptation patterns. The study is based on household survey data generated from in-depth interview of 186 households drawn from six purposively selected pastoral associations in Yabello district in southern Ethiopia. To analyze the collected data, both descriptive statistics such as mean, frequency, independent-sample t test, and Chi-square test and econometric model were employed. Most of the Borana pastoral households were found to have already embraced diverse non-pastoral activities such as crop farming to sustain their life in the face of mounting internal and external pressures. Nevertheless, they are still less likely to totally abandon pastoral ways of life. The model outputs revealed that the likelihood of pastoral households to use herd mobility as an adaptive response is explained by availability of labor force, size of livestock holdings, and access to climate information. Interestingly, the size of livestock holdings determined the pastoral household’s adaptation patterns, indicating that livestock production still plays major economic and sociocultural roles in Borana pastoral contexts. Based on the findings, it is recommended that pastoral responses such as long-established mobility practice and current herd diversifications should be backed by responsive institutional support services. Finally, the study suggests that current hasty private range enclosures for both crop cultivation and fodder reserves should be reframed and supported by well-structured institutions for sustainable future and equitable resource use rights. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptive responses; Borana; Climate variability; Determinants; Pastoral system","cultivation; ecosystem resilience; enclosure experiment; household survey; livestock farming; numerical model; pastoralism; questionnaire survey; resource use; sustainability; Borana; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062847762

While there are numerous contributing factors behind these changes, the effect of a changing climate has not been thoroughly studied. This paper adds a significant contribution to the knowledge base through analysis from a survey of 186 herder households, interviews with 38 key participants, and four focus group discussions with individuals from three National Parks and Conservation areas in the high-mountain region of Nepal. Additionally, a review of the existing policies and programs on pastoralism was carried out. Results demonstrate several reasons behind the decline of transhumance pastoralism: Policy focus on the establishment of conservation areas, increasing vulnerability to extreme events (avalanches, snowfall, storms, and disappearing water sources), and ineffective government policies and programs. Hardships involved in herding combined with changing social values and the degradation of pasture quality were identified as contributing factors to the growing challenges facing mountain pastoralism. Similarly, the declining interest among herders to continue their profession can be traced to vulnerability associated with escalating climate change impacts. Considerable knowledge gaps regarding threats to high-altitude pastoralism remain, and continued research on pastureland conservation, capacity development, facilitation for climate change adaptation, and coping strategies for herders in the high mountains is urgently needed. Our analysis suggests that non-climatic variables such as policy and globalization were more influential in eroding pastoralism as compared to climate change. © 2020 by the authors.","Livelihood; Livestock farming; Range land; Transhumance system","adaptive management; climate change; environmental change; globalization; household survey; mountain region; national park; vulnerability; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083639255

To explore host-symbiont cell cycle coordination in a marine symbiosis, we employed a model for coral-dinoflagellate associations: the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia (Exaiptasia pallida) and its native microalgal photosymbionts (Breviolum minutum and Breviolum psygmophilum). Using fluorescent labeling and spatial point-pattern image analyses to characterize cell population distributions in both partners, we developed protocols that are tailored to the three-dimensional cellular landscape of a symbiotic sea anemone tentacle. Introducing cultured symbiont cells to symbiont-free adult hosts increased overall host cell proliferation rates. The acceleration occurred predominantly in the symbiont-containing gastrodermis near clusters of symbionts but was also observed in symbiont-free epidermal tissue layers, indicating that the presence of symbionts contributes to elevated proliferation rates in the entire host during colonization. Symbiont cell cycle progression differed between cultured algae and those residing within hosts; the endosymbiotic state resulted in increased S-phase but decreased G2/M-phase symbiont populations. These phenotypes and the deceleration of cell cycle progression varied with symbiont identity and host nutritional status. These results demonstrate that host and symbiont cells have substantial and species-specific effects on the proliferation rates of their mutualistic partners. This is the first empirical evidence to support speciesspecific regulation of the symbiont cell cycle within a single cnidarian-dinoflagellate association; similar regulatory mechanisms likely govern interpartner coordination in other coral-algal symbioses and shape their ecophysiological responses to a changing climate. IMPORTANCE Biomass regulation is critical to the overall health of cnidariandinoflagellate symbioses. Despite the central role of the cell cycle in the growth and proliferation of cnidarian host cells and dinoflagellate symbionts, there are few studies that have examined the potential for host-symbiont coregulation. This study provides evidence for the acceleration of host cell proliferation when in local proximity to clusters of symbionts within cnidarian tentacles. The findings suggest that symbionts augment the cell cycle of not only their enveloping host cells but also neighboring cells in the epidermis and gastrodermis. This provides a possible mechanism for rapid colonization of cnidarian tissues. In addition, the cell cycles of symbionts differed depending on nutritional regime, symbiotic state, and species identity. The responses of cell cycle profiles to these different factors implicate a role for speciesspecific regulation of symbiont cell cycles within host cnidarian tissues. © 2020 Tivey et al.","Aiptasia; Cell proliferation; Colonization; Coral; Exaiptasia pallida; Symbiodiniaceae; Symbiosis","adult; Aiptasia pallida; algal cell culture; article; biomass; cell cycle M phase; cell cycle progression; cell cycle S phase; cell population; cell proliferation; climate; controlled study; coral; deceleration; dinoflagellate; epidermis; female; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; host cell; human cell; human experiment; image analysis; male; nonhuman; nutritional status; phenotype; regulatory mechanism; symbiont; tentacle; animal; cell cycle; cytology; dinoflagellate; metabolism; physiology; sea anemone; species difference; symbiosis; Animals; Cell Cycle; Dinoflagellida; Nutrients; Sea Anemones; Species Specificity; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081665318

We conducted multiple airborne surveys of the 12 active UGS facilities in California between January 2016 and November 2017 using advanced remote sensing and in situ observations of near-surface atmospheric methane (CH4). These measurements where combined with wind data to derive spatially and temporally resolved methane emission estimates for California UGS facilities and key components with spatial resolutions as small as 1-3 m and revisit intervals ranging from minutes to months. The study spanned normal operations, malfunctions, and maintenance activity from multiple facilities including the active phase of the Aliso Canyon blowout incident in 2016 and subsequent return to injection operations in summer 2017. We estimate that the net annual methane emissions from the UGS sector in California averaged between 11.0 3.8 GgCH4 yr-1 (remote sensing) and 12.3 3.8 GgCH4 yr-1 (in situ). Net annual methane emissions for the 7 facilities that reported emissions in 2016 were estimated between 9.0 3.2 GgCH4 yr-1 (remote sensing) and 9.5 3.2 GgCH4 yr-1 (in situ), in both cases around 5 times higher than reported. The majority of methane emissions from UGS facilities in this study are likely dominated by anomalous activity: higher than expected compressor loss and leaking bypass isolation valves. Significant variability was observed at different time-scales: daily compressor duty-cycles and infrequent but large emissions from compressor station blow-downs. This observed variability made comparison of remote sensing and in situ observations challenging given measurements were derived largely at different times, however, improved agreement occurred when comparing simultaneous measurements. Temporal variability in emissions remains one of the most challenging aspects of UGS emissions quantification, underscoring the need for more systematic and persistent methane monitoring. © 2020 The Author(s).

Despite this, the proportion of microbial and thermogenic methane in discovered and producing fields from this area is still not well understood. Understanding the relative contributions of these sources in subsurface environments is important to understanding how and where economically substantial amounts of methane form. In addition, this information will help identify sources of environmental emissions of hydrocarbons to the atmosphere. We apply stable isotopes including methane clumped-isotope measurements to solution and associated gases from several producing fields in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to estimate the proportions, properties and origins of microbial and thermogenic endmembers. Clumped isotopes of methane are unique indicators of whether methane is at thermodynamic isotopic equilibrium or affected by kinetic processes. The clumped methane thermometer can provide insights into formation temperatures and/or into kinetic processes such as microbial methanogenesis, early catagenetic processes, mixing, combinatorial processes, and diffusion. In this data set, we find that some fluids have clumped isotope methane apparent temperatures consistent with the methane component being produced solely by the thermogenic breakdown of larger organic molecules at substantially greater temperatures than those reached in shallow reservoirs. A portion of these reservoirs with hot clumped isotope methane temperatures are consistent with exhibiting a kinetic isotope effect. Other reservoirs have clumped isotope methane apparent temperatures, and other isotopic and molecular proportions, consistent with mixtures of microbial and thermogenic methane. We show that in certain cases the evidence is most consistent with formation of the microbial methane in the current reservoir. However, in other cases the methane is produced at significantly shallower depths and is then transported to greater depths as a result of post generation burial of methane bearing sedimentary sequences to the current reservoir conditions. For the first time, we show that methane of an unambiguously purely microbial origin (i.e. those that do not contain obvious contributions of thermogenic methane) is dominantly generated at temperatures less than 60 °C, despite burial to greater depths. This finding suggests that, while microorganisms are able to generate methane at temperatures up to 105 °C under laboratory conditions (Brock, 1985), in the Gulf of Mexico, microbial methane is dominantly produced in the 20–60 °C window. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Clumped isotopologues; Gulf of Mexico; Methane; Natural Gas Geochemistry","deep water; gas production; geochemistry; methane; natural gas; stable isotope; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081278965

This article reviews the literature on climate change impacts and adaptation in the Chesapeake Bay region (USA). We reviewed both climate impacts and adaptation literature (n = 283) published in the period 2007-2018 to answer the questions: (i) how are indicators of climate impacts measured and reported by different types of authors (e.g., scientists, government, and NGOs), document types (e.g., academic articles or reports), and geographic focus (e.g., State, region, county, or municipal level)? (ii) what are the current approaches for measuring the most pressing climate impacts in the Chesapeake Bay? We found that scientists produce the most amount of data but are increasingly shifting towards engaging with practitioners through reports and online resources. Most indicators focus on the Chesapeake Bay scale, but data is most needed at the local level where adaptive policies are implemented. Our analysis shows emerging approaches to monitoring climate hazards and areas where synergies between types of authors are likely to increase resilience in the 21st century. This review expands the understanding of the information network in the Chesapeake Bay and explores the institutional landscape of stakeholders involved in the production and consumption of environmental and social change data. The analysis and insights of this review may be extended to similar regions around the planet experiencing or anticipating similar climate hazards to the Chesapeake Bay. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate governance; Climate indicators; Knowledge; Maryland; Qualitative analysis",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084299190

Indeed, PM2.5 may not only cause respiratory and cardiovascular abnormalities but it may also affect other organs such as the liver. Be that as it may, only a few studies have evaluated the PM2.5 effects on hepatic tissue. Moreover, most of them have not analyzed the relationship between particles composition and toxicological effects. In this study, healthy rats were subjected to urban levels of PM2.5 particles in order to assess their structural and functional effects on the liver. During the exposure periods, mean PM2.5 concentrations were slightly higher than the value suggested by the daily guideline of the World Health Organization. The exposed rats showed a hepatic increase of Cr, Zn, Fe, Ba, Tl and Pb levels. This group also showed leukocyte infiltration, sinusoidal dilation, hydropic inclusions and alterations in carbohydrates distribution. These histologic lesions were accompanied by serological changes, such as increase of total cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as genotoxic damage in their nuclei. We also observed significant associations between several biomarkers and PM2.5 composition. Our results show that exposure to low levels of PM2.5 might cause histologic and serological changes in liver tissue, suggesting that PM2.5 toxicity is influenced not only by their concentration but also by their composition and the exposure frequency. © 2019, Korean Society of Toxicology.","Biomarkers; Elemental composition; Liver; PAHs; PM2.5",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080100548

This letter, instead, considers a dynamical fingerprinting localization scenario for the device with intermittently emission status, whereby the fingerprints are obtained by the combination of RSS and AoA via the popular massive-antenna deployment. Taking account of the dynamical behaviour of the target and its spatial sparsity, a novel Sparse-constrained Sequential Sensing (SCSS) framework is designed. The target's emission status and sparse location are jointly captured by a Random Finite Set (RFS), and its a posteriori distributions are recursively estimated via the Bayesian statistical inference technique. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our SCSS technique can detect the presence of the device precisely, and also improve tracking accuracy significantly when compared to static counterparts. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","fingerprinting localization; recursive estimation; simultaneous detecting and tracking; Sparse-constrained sequential sensing","Electrical engineering; Mathematical models; Antenna deployments; Bayesian statistical inference; Dynamical behaviours; Joint detection; Posteriori distribution; Random finite set (RFS); Sequential sensing; Tracking accuracy; Antennas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083154958

Surprisingly, given R e occupies a large component of annual carbon balance, rather less attention has been paid to developing the estimates of R e compared to GPP. Results: Based on 11 flux sites over the diverse grassland ecosystems in northern China, this study examined the amounts of carbon released by R e as well as the dominant environmental controls across temperate meadow steppe, typical steppe, desert steppe and alpine meadow, respectively. Multi-year mean R e revealed relatively less CO2 emitted by the desert steppe in comparison with other grassland ecosystems. Meanwhile, C emissions of all grasslands were mainly controlled by the growing period. Correlation analysis revealed that apart from air and soil temperature, soil water content exerted a strong effect on the variability in R e, which implied the great potential to derive R e using relevant remote sensing data. Then, these field-measured R e data were up-scaled to large areas using time-series MODIS information and remote sensing-based piecewise regression models. These semi-empirical models appeared to work well with a small margin of error (R 2 and RMSE ranged from 0.45 to 0.88 and from 0.21 to 0.69 g C m-2 d-1, respectively). Conclusions: Generally, the piecewise models from the growth period and dormant season performed better than model developed directly from the entire year. Moreover, the biases between annual mean R e observations and the remotely-derived products were usually within 20%. Finally, the regional R e emissions across northern China's grasslands was approximately 100.66 Tg C in 2010, about 1/3 of carbon fixed from the MODIS GPP product. Specially, the desert steppe exhibited the highest ratio, followed by the temperate meadow steppe, typical steppe and alpine meadow. Therefore, this work provides a novel framework to accurately predict the spatio-temporal patterns of R e over large areas, which can greatly reduce the uncertainties in global carbon estimates and climate projections. © 2020 The Author(s).","Ecosystem respiration; Grassland; MODIS; Piecewise regression","carbon cycle; carbon flux; ecosystem dynamics; ecosystem response; environmental monitoring; grassland; MODIS; remote sensing; respiration; terrestrial ecosystem; transect; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084316134

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been developing new approaches to screen the characteristics of vehicle dynamic emission control behaviors (its operating signature) while driving both on-road and on-dynamometer. The so-called ""signature device"" used for this testing is equipped with an O2/NOx sensor, thermocouple and GPS to record dynamic exhaust NOx concentration, air fuel ratio-controlled tailpipe lambda (λ), tailpipe temperature and vehicle speed (acceleration). In the early EPA research, signature screening was used to characterize a vehicle's PCM control behaviors (cause/effect bijectivity), which help distinguish operation in normal control state-space and abnormal state-space. Currently, signature devices are being used to recognize when ammonia (NH3) has been emitted and to estimate the presence of NOx and NH3 within on-road and on-dyno driving. The presence of NH3 is observed by the signature device's NOx sensor at times when tailpipe lambda readings are biased rich, after the engine three-way-catalyst (TWC) has warmed up. To study the production of NH3, EPA established a vehicle test program to gather and evaluate the emissions from on-road driving conditions. The same driving conditions were then replicated on an indoor chassis dynamometer (dyno) while using a bag analyzer bench, a raw exhaust modal bench, and a signature device to measure vehicle emissions and control behaviors. EPA ascertained, under certain operating conditions, that stoichiometric engine exhaust passing through a TWC can create hydrogen (CO+H2O→H2), which is then available to produce unregulated ammonia (CO+NO+H2→NH3).

Experiments on the metal engines showed that four consecutive injections delivered by a single injector can achieve isobaric combustion. Improved understanding of the detailed fuel-air mixing with multiple consecutive injections is needed to optimize the isobaric combustion and reduce engine emissions. In this study, we explored the fuel spray characteristics of the four-consecutive-injections strategy using high-speed imaging with background illumination and fuel-tracer planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging in a heavy-duty optical engine under non-reactive conditions. Toluene of 2% by volume was added to the n-heptane and served as the tracer. The fourth harmonic of a 10 Hz Nd:YAG laser was applied for the excitation of toluene. The PLIF image distortion caused by the side window curvature and the optical piston was mitigated using a correction lens and corrected with a grid mapping technique. The effects of hydraulic delay and injection dwell on the in-cylinder liquid-phase fuel penetration and vapor-phase fuel distribution were evaluated under different combinations of the four direct injections. The high-speed imaging of the liquid-phase spray shows that a short injection dwell reduces the hydraulic delay of the injector, resulting in an increase in both the peak liquid-phase penetration length and the injection duration. The fuel-tracer PLIF imaging clarifies the spatial fuel distribution of the four consecutive injections involved with the interaction between the vapor-phase spray and the piston bowl wall and the squish region. The intensity distribution in the PLIF images confirms that a longer injector hydraulic delay leads to a shorter peak vapor-phase spray penetration length and a reduced flow rate. © 2020 SAE International.

In line with the global trend, Malaysia has endeavored to develop hydropower and this was demonstrated in the proposal of 12 mega dams in one single Bornean state of Malaysia under the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy. Two of the dams are currently operational and one is at its early stage of construction. The mega dams have raised much doubt at their inception in view of the cumulative social and environmental impacts they could bring. Commissioning of two mega dams was immediately followed by establishment of energy-intensive plants sparking further need for energy. This article therefore aims to examine the energy supply and demand scenario and discuss the available energy options. These are achieved via desktop study and literature review. It points to a lack of planning in energy utilization in relation to the industrial expansion aspired, which gives rise to a reactive response to mounting energy demand without due consideration to other potential energy options. This contrasts the strategic energy planning practiced in developed nations and the socio-energy systems design advocated by some researchers.

Afforestation is considered an adaptation option because it reduces flood risks by decreasing total runoff and peak river discharge, but it also exacerbates drought risks by increasing evapotranspiration. In this study, both effects of afforestation were evaluated in comparison with changes caused by climate warming from the viewpoint of an adaptation measure, using a land surface model. The upper Chao Phraya River basin was taken as a case study. The present climate was set as a base condition and future climate conditions projected by the moderate (RCP4.5) and strong (RCP8.5) warming scenarios in the middle and late 21st century were used. The effects of afforestation were much smaller than the changes caused by warming even with the extreme forest area expansion and soil property changes. The effect of afforestation that reduced runoff was marked in the wet season, whereas the effect of afforestation that increased evapotranspiration was noticeable in the dry season leading to little increase in dry-season runoff. These results indicate that both the decrease in runoff that reduces flood risks in the wet season and the increase in evapotranspiration that exacerbates drought risks in the dry season should be taken into consideration when evaluating the hydrological effects of afforestation under global warming. © 2020 The Author(s).

This study presents the new dating and the first pollen records from Afyon (Sarıkavak) tufas, SW-Turkey, together with lithofacies descriptions, geochemical and petrographic results obtained from drilling cores (SL-2, SL-6 and SL-7). The data extensively provides insight into palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic changes during the Middle-Late Pleistocene period. According to core samples, these fluvial tufa occurrences formed in high-gradient and stepped fluvial conditions have been defined as barrage-dammed and terraced-slope systems in the investigated area. The depositional lithofacies are moss tufa included macrophytes, bryophytes and vertical stems, phytoclastic tufa, peloidal tufa, micritic tufa, microbial tufa, intraclastic tufa, extra-formational tufa, lime-muddy clay and paleosol level, in respectively. The new U/Th radiometric dating and stable isotopes are evaluated together with previously published results. In regard to new radiometric data, tufa deposits occurred predominantly during the Marine Isotopic Stages, at 313.3 ± 21 (MIS 9), 295.8 ± 63 (MIS 8-9), 230.8 ± 42 (MIS 7d-e), 228.8 ± 12 (MIS 7d), 215.7 ± 17 (MIS 7c) and 188.2 ± 16 (MIS 6-7a) ka, respectively. The climatic changes occurring between glacial and interglacial periods (such as during the Middle –Late Pleistocene) might probably influenced the precipitation of tufas in the area. In addition, the less negative and the more positive carbon isotopic values (between −0.8 and + 1.3‰ V-PDB) could be related to the progressive downstream CO2 degassing from host rocks, enhanced by high-velocity current conditions, changes in the soil-CO2 contribution and photosynthesis. The changes of δ18O values (between −8.3 and −10.1‰ V-PDB) are most probably related to variable effects of evaporation in depositional environment. Palynofloral data, gives important clues about the paleovegetation and paleoclimate of the region. This field survey has been conducted the first time in this area. Both carbon values and palynological findings show that drought conditions were dominantly present in the Pleistocene period, but in some processes drought conditions decreased depending on the amount of rainfall. The increasing amount of gymnosperm pollens is more likely to appear in more humid conditions due to the decreasing of drought condition in this time interval. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Dating; Non-marine carbonates; Palaeoclimate; Palynology; Stable isotopes; SW-Turkey","carbonate; dating method; geochemistry; interdisciplinary approach; lithofacies; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; petrography; Pleistocene; pollen; tufa; Afyon; Turkey; Bryophyta; bryophytes; Gymnospermae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076961228

This is because the air inlets near the floor and the exhaust opening at the ceiling allow the excess heat and the old air to be displaced from the animal area to the upper part of the building. Typical inlet types of UFAD systems in Flanders (Belgium) are the slatted floor units placed in service alley. The main drawback in pig buildings with UFAD systems is that during winter, cold draughts often occur in the animal area, and due to the air displacement ventilation process, there is a risk of NH3 transport from the slurry pit. The effect of NH3 emissions is important as it leads to acidification and eutrophication. Modelling airflows and NH3 emissions using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can promote the development of techniques for mitigating NH3 emissions, improving indoor air quality and animal thermal comfort. A steady-state CFD model was therefore developed to predict the indoor airflow and NH3 distribution in a pig compartment with a UFAD system. An advanced NH3 emission modelling approach was implemented in the CFD model to simulate NH3 generation in the slurry pit and pen floor. In order to validate the CFD model, two experiments were performed. The first experiment was conducted in a compartment with mock-up pigs at different ventilation rates to validate the modelled air velocity and temperature fields. The second experiment was conducted in a compartment occupied by real pigs to validate the modelled airflow patterns, temperature, CO2 and NH3 concentrations. Overall, there was a good agreement between the simulated and measured results. The field experiment and CFD model results confirmed that NH3 was transported from the slurry pit to the compartment. The air exchange rate of the slurry pit in the CFD model increased from 10.4 to 26.1 h−1 as the ventilation rate was increased from 11 to 92 m3 h−1 pig−1 due to the air displacement in the slurry pit. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonia emission; CFD simulation; Displacement airflow pattern; Pig building; Underfloor air distribution system","Air intakes; Air quality; Ammonia; Computational fluid dynamics; Eutrophication; Floors; Indoor air pollution; Mammals; Ventilation; Airflow patterns; Ammonia emissions; CFD simulations; Pig building; Underfloor air distribution systems; Air; air quality; airflow; ammonia; computational fluid dynamics; concentration (composition); cooling; emission; floor; pig; slurry; ventilation; Belgium; Flanders; Animalia; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080098444

The investigation by the Houston Health Department (HHD) found that while operating within legal limits, emissions from facilities that use torch cutting, a technique generating metal aerosols, may increase health risks for neighboring residents. Choosing to use collaborative problem solving over legislative rulemaking, HHD reached out to The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) to further evaluate and develop plans to mitigate, if necessary, health risks associated with metal emissions from these facilities. Methods: Utilizing a community-based participatory research approach, we constituted a research team from academia, HHD and an air quality advocacy group and a Community Advisory Board (CAB) to draw diverse stakeholders (i.e., frustrated and concerned residents and wary facility managers acting within their legal rights) into an equitable, trusting and respectful space to work together. Next, we investigated metal air pollution and inhalation health risks of adults living near metal recyclers and ascertained community views about environmental health using key informant interviews, focus groups and surveys. Finally, working collaboratively with the CAB, we developed neighborhood-specific public health action plans to address research findings. Results: After overcoming challenges, the CAB evolved into an effective partnership with greater trust, goodwill, representation and power among members. Working together to translate and share health risk assessment results increased accessibility of the information. These results, coupled to community survey findings, set the groundwork for developing and implementing a stakeholder-informed action plan, which included a voluntary framework to reduce metal emissions in the scrap yard, improved lines of communication and environmental health leadership training. Tangible outcomes of enhanced capacity of our community and governmental partners included trained residents to conduct door-to-door surveys, adaptation of our field training protocol and survey by our community partner and development of a successful HHD program to engage residents to improve environmental health in their neighborhood. Conclusions: Academic-government-community-industry partnerships can reduce environmental health disparities in underserved neighborhoods near industrial facilities. © 2020 The Author(s).","Academic-government-community-industry partnership; Community advisory board; Community-based participatory research; Environmental justice, Public health action plan; Metal air pollution","academic research; air quality; atmospheric pollution; environmental justice; government; health risk; leadership; neighborhood; public health; risk assessment; adult; advocacy group; air pollution; air quality; article; controlled study; environmental health; government; health care planning; health hazard; human; industry; inhalation; interview; justice; leadership; manager; participatory research; public health service; resident; respect; risk assessment; trust; air pollution; city; classification; demography; environmental exposure; environmental health; public-private partnership; recycling; socioeconomics; Texas; university; Houston; Texas; United States; metal; Air Pollution; Cities; Community-Based Participatory Research; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Humans; Metals; Public-Private Sector Partnerships; Recycling; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; Texas; Universities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083071263

However, a significant increase in electricity demand by EVs might impact the stable operation of the existing power grid. Meanwhile, EV charging is acceptable to most users if it is completed by the time of the next driving event. From the viewpoint of power grid operators, flexibility for shifting the timing of EV charging would be advantageous, including making effective use of renewable energy. In this work, an EV model and simulation tool were developed to make clear how the total charging demand of all EVs in use will be influenced by future EV specifications (e.g., charge power) and installation of charging infrastructure. Among the most influential factors, EV charging behavior according to use cases and regional characteristics were statistically analyzed based on the real-world usage data of over 14, 000 EVs and incorporated in the simulation tool. Using the resultant statistical model, the Monte Carlo method was applied to conduct a parameter simulation study of continuous EV usage. The impact of EV charging demand on the power grid in a future scenario and also the benefit of controlling EV charging were evaluated quantitatively in the study.

Recent discoveries have, however, shown that metal complexes of such ligands also have huge potential in photochemical research and in the activation of small molecules. We present here three ReI complexes with mesoionic pyridyl-carbene ligands. The complexes display reduction steps which were investigated via UV-vis-NIR-IR spectro-electrochemistry, and these results point toward an EC mechanism. The ReI compounds emit in the visible range in solution at room temperature with excited state lifetimes that are dependent on the substituents of the mesoionic carbenes. These complexes are also potent electrocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO. Whereas the substituents on the carbenes have no influence on the reduction potentials, the electrocatalytic efficiency is strongly dependent on the substituents. This fact is likely a result of catalyst instability. The results presented here thus introduce mesoionic carbenes as new potent ligands for the generation of emissive ReI complexes and for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082182627

However, the vehicle pollution in middle-sized cities becomes more severe due to the increasing vehicle population (VP) and lagged control policy. This study takes Langfang, a typical middle-sized city bordered by two megacities (Beijing and Tianjin), as the target domain to investigate vehicle emissions. The speed correction curves (SCC) are introduced to improve the vehicle emission factors (EF) simulation in official technical guidelines on emission inventory (GEI). A multi-year vehicle emission inventory (from 2011 to 2025) is developed in Langfang. From 2011 to 2017, the total vehicle emissions in Langfang decrease for carbon monoxide (CO), but increase for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and inhalable particles (PM10), respectively. From 2018 to 2025, the emissions would increase more rapidly in Langfang than in Beijing and Tianjin, indicating the middle-sized cities may become a significant contributor to air pollution in China. Four possible control policies, including VP constrained (VPC), public transportation promotion (PTP), new energy vehicles promotion (NEP), and freight transportation structure optimization (FTO) are evaluated. The most significant emissions reductions are observed under the FTO for CO, NOx, and PM10, and under the VPC for VOCs. The spatial distributions of vehicle emissions show a high order of heterogeneity, indicating that local conditions should be considered in policy formulation in addition to national consistency. More comprehensive policies should be implemented to mitigate the vehicle pollution in middle-sized cities. © 2020 The Authors","Emission factors; Emission inventory; Policy evaluation; Spatial distribution; Vehicle emissions","Air pollution; Carbon monoxide; Freight transportation; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution control; Spatial distribution; Structural optimization; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollution in chinas; Emission factors; Emission inventories; Policy evaluation; Public transportation; Transportation structures; Vehicle emission; Vehicle emission factors; Vehicles; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; emission inventory; error correction; future prospect; nitrogen oxides; policy analysis; pollutant source; pollution policy; spatial distribution; traffic emission; urban area; urban pollution; volatile organic compound; Article; China; emission factor; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; environmental policy; exhaust gas; freight transportation structure optimization; geographic distribution; guideline on emission inventory; humidity; new energy vehicle promotion; priority journal; public transportation promotion; speed correction curve; temperature; traffic and transport; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Langfang; Tianjin; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078985706

In this paper, we present a measurement of South Asia's environmental sustainability performance for the years 2001–2015. Our results reveal that Bhutan outperforms the rest of the countries in South Asia, with an overall index score of 0.72. Nepal comes second in the region, with a stable score, followed by the Maldives. Afghanistan and Bangladesh are ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, and their overall scores indicate strong potential sustainability performances. India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan follow this list, with poor scores, with Pakistan having the lowest scores during the study period.

Methods: Exergy-based resource accounting method was adopted by this study. Cumulative exergy demand (CExD) was used to characterize the resource consumption intensity of cement clinker production using natural mineral in China. Exergy-based characterization factors of land resource and CO2 emission were employed to determine the resource benefit brought by the substitution of CCS for natural limestone (land saving and CO2 reduction). Results and discussion: The CExD value of cement clinker production using natural mineral as raw material in China is 5005 MJ/t, and the consumption of raw coal is the largest contributor to this result, accounting for approximately 81% of the CExD value. The phenomenon that coal consumption dominates the CExD result may be because, through combustion reactions, the chemical state of carbon contained in coal almost reaches equilibrium with its chemical dead state in terms of exergy and is deeply dissipated; in comparison, the major chemical compound contained in limestone, i.e., calcium oxide, is mostly transformed into cement clinker by the reactions occurred in the production system, instead of being consumed in a deeply dissipated way and emitted to the environment. The major disadvantage of using CCS for cement clinker production is the increase of coal consumption, i.e., 515 MJ/t cement clinker, and the major advantage of using CCS for cement clinker production is the resource benefit brought by CO2 reduction (the avoided biotic resource damage in ecosystem), i.e., 1160 MJ/t cement clinker. Conclusions: From the analysis on the influence of the substitution of CCS for limestone on the resource consumption intensity, we found that the resource consumption intensity of the production system using CCS is approximately 15.5% lower than that of the production system using natural mineral; however, if this resource benefit is neglected, the resource consumption intensity of the production system using CCS is approximately 7.6% higher than that of the production system using natural mineral. We suggest that establishing a theoretical bridge between the characterization models of biotic resource and abiotic resource will still be a significant research direction in the future, which is fundamental in objectively understanding and unifying the issues of emission reduction and resource saving. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Calcium carbide sludge (CCS); Cement clinker; Exergy; Resource consumption","carbon; cement; coal; limestone; mineral; Article; calcium carbide sludge; China; coal power; combustion; energy conservation; energy consumption; energy resource; environmental decision making; environmental impact; environmental policy; environmental protection; industrial waste; natural resource; priority journal; reaction analysis; sludge; solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077714721

In view of the harmfulness of traffic emissions, energy conservation and emission reduction have become strategic goals for the development of the transportation industry. Guiding students to realize ecological driving and reducing vehicle fuel energy consumption and emissions have increasingly attracted the attention of researchers. We are supposed to do a research on signalized intersections at important nodes of urban transportation, use ecological driving to simulate the operation of bicycles and vehicle queues, establish an ecological driving model, and control energy conservation and emission reduction goals from multiple perspectives. This paper combines the ecological driving technology and micro fuel consumption calculation model under the vehicle-road collaborative environment to study the fleets within the signalized intersection. At the same time this paper proposes street signs, models, and case applications that can effectively reduce the average fuel consumption and parking times of the vehicles passing the signalized intersection to ensure the smoothness of operation at signalized intersections has been reduced, and rapid acceleration and deceleration operations have been performed. After verification, the establishment of the fleet's eco-driving model has great effectiveness. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083160470

Both characteristics have been documented in many Marpole period sites. Recent research has however cast doubt on this model, finding little evidence of either intensification or of widespread abundance of salmon relative to other fish in NWC sites, including Marpole period sites. Here we present new data on Maplebank, a large, stratified archaeological site on Vancouver Island. Our data indicate that Maplebank has surprisingly high proportions of salmon to other fish compared to other NWC sites, but little evidence of Marpole-like traits; clearly, Maplebank is not a good fit with the salmon intensification and socioeconomic complexity model. A more organic perspective taken in this paper demonstrates that over time, Maplebank’s population and economy were primarily affected by localized geographic and climate changes. Our approach demonstrates that Maplebank—and likely Marpole sites—are best understood within the context of changing local geography, ecology and history over time, rather than through the lens of sociocultural complexity. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","late Holocene; Maplebank site; Marpole; Northwest Coast; salmon","abundance; climate change; geographical variation; Holocene; salmonid; socioeconomic conditions; British Columbia; Canada; Pacific Northwest; Vancouver Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067550082

One promising carbon capture technology is chemical-looping combustion (CLC). In CLC the reactors are filled with metal oxide bed material called oxygen carriers. The interaction between oxygen carriers and biomass ashes is a poorly explored field. To make CLC a viable process, and thereby creating carbon emission reductions, more knowledge about the interactions between biomass ashes and oxygen carriers is needed. This study investigated solid-state reactions of three promising oxygen carriers, hematite, hausmannite and synthesised ilmenite with different biomass ash components. Oxygen carriers were exposed with the ash components: calcium carbonate, silica and potassium carbonate at 900 °C and at different reducing potentials. Crystalline phases of the exposed samples were determined using powder x-ray diffraction (XRD). Results showed that the oxygen carriers hausmannite and hematite interact to a higher extent compared to synthesised ilmenite regarding both physical characteristics and detectable phases. Synthesised ilmenite formed new phases only in systems including potassium. Thermodynamic calculations were performed on the multicomponent system and compared with experimental results. The results suggest that optimisation of systems involving manganese and potassium should be performed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass ash; Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC); Ilmenite; Oxygen carrier","Biomass; Calcium carbonate; Combustion; Emission control; Hematite; Ilmenite; Metals; Oxygen; Potash; Silica; Solid state reactions; Biomass ashes; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon emission reductions; Chemical-looping combustion; Oxygen Carrier; Powder X ray diffraction; Renewable energy systems; Thermodynamic calculations; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076281926

Learning from unplanned autonomous biological adaptation may be considered undesirable and incompatible with human endeavor. However, it is argued that there is no need for agency, and planned adaptation is not necessarily preferable over autonomous adaptation. What matters is the efficacy of adaptive mechanisms and their capacity to increase societal resilience to current and future impacts. In addition, there is great scope for industrial ecology (IE) to contribute approaches to climate change adaptation that generate system models and baseline data to inform decision making. The problem of “uncertainty” was chosen as an example of a challenge that is shared by biological systems, IE, and climate change adaptation to show how biological adaptation might contribute solutions. Finally, the Coastal Climate Adaptation Decision Support tool was used to demonstrate how IE and biological adaptation approaches may be mainstreamed in climate change adaptation planning and practice. In conclusion, there is close conceptual alignment between evolutionary biology and IE. The integration of biological adaptation thinking can enrich IE, add new perspectives to climate change adaptation science, and support IE's engagement with climate change adaptation. There should be no major obstacles regarding the collaboration of industrial ecologists with the climate change adaptation community, but mainstreaming of biological adaptation solutions depends greatly on successful knowledge transfer and the engagement of open-minded and informed adaptation stakeholders. © 2019 by Yale University","biological adaptation; biologically inspired design; climate change adaptation; evolution; industrial ecology","Biology; Biomimetics; Climate models; Decision making; Decision support systems; Ecology; Gene transfer; Knowledge management; Biological adaptation; Biologically inspired design; Climate change adaptation; evolution; Industrial ecology; Climate change; adaptation; climate change; decision making; evolutionary biology; gene transfer; industrial ecology; phenotypic plasticity; stakeholder",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068458528

Both climate and land surface change have adverse implications on the natural hydrological system in terms of variation in the run-off regime, surface storage, evapotranspiration, subsurface ﬂow and infiltration, thereby affecting the hydrology of the river basin as a whole. Even though several studies worldwide have attempted to address the influence of climate change, land-use change and human activities on the hydrology of river basins, either as a whole or limited to a few components of the hydrological cycle, limited attention has been given to study the hydrological changes in the river basins of arid and semi-arid tropics, which are essentially fed by precipitation. The objective of the study is to analyse the changes in hydrological characteristics of the Cauvery river basin, a semi-arid river basin in South India. The changes in the hydrology of the Cauvery river basin are studied by analysing the trends in hydro-meteorological parameters using Mann-Kendall trend tests and Sen’s estimator of the slope. The results showed that the changes in the volume of rainfall and the number of rainy days significantly affect the overall hydrological regime of the river basin. The analysis of annual and seasonal rainfall over the Cauvery river basin showed a decreasing trend in the middle Cauvery basin. A declining trend in the number of rainfall events was also observed in the middle Cauvery region. The effect of decreasing trend in the volume of rainfall and number of rainy days is evident from the decreasing trends in the streamflow of the main channel and tributaries of the Cauvery river. The regions of increase in evapotranspiration showed a significant correlation with the regions which exhibited a decline in groundwater level. © 2020, © 2020 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.","Cauvery river; Hydrological change; semi-arid; trend analysis; Western Ghats","climate change; hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; precipitation intensity; regional climate; runoff; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; Cauvery River; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079717769

In this study, after screening 461 global case studies, we examine four national household transitions in heat, and examine their implications for governance. These transitions were both rapid, involving transformations in heat provision in a short timeframe of 18–35 years; and deep, involving diffusion that collectively reached more than 100 million households and more than 310 million people. From 1995 to 2015, China stimulated industrial research with strong municipal and national targets and policies to the point where they saw adoption rates for solar thermal systems surpass 95% market penetration in many urban areas. From 1976 to 2011, Denmark blended small-scale decentralized community control with national standards and policies to promote district heating so it reached 80% of household needs. From 2000 to 2018, Finland harnessed user and peer-to-peer learning, and innovation, alongside national and European policies and incentives so that heat pumps reached almost a third of all homes. From 1960 to 1977, The United Kingdom coordinated a nationalized Gas Council and Area Boards with industry groups, appliance manufacturers, installers and marketing campaigns so that gas central heating reached almost half of all homes. These four rapid case studies share commonalities in polycentric governance, rooted in (1) equity, (2) inclusivity, (3) information and innovation, (4) ownership and accountability, (5) organizational multiplicity, and (6) experimentation and flexibility. The study affirms that designing the right sort of political and governance architecture can be just as salient as technical innovation and development in stimulating transitions. © 2020 The Authors","Energy and climate governance; Energy transitions; Heat as a service; Heat decarbonisation; Polycentrism; Residential heating","Commerce; Decarbonization; Industrial research; Marketing; Public policy; Decarbonisation; Energy and climate governance; Energy transitions; Polycentrism; Residential heating; Heating; climate change; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; environmental policy; governance approach; heating; household energy; China; Denmark; Finland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079165055

In such dryland systems, the effect of grazing on native plant diversity has been equivocal, some studies suggesting that grazing reduces native plant diversity, others that grazing increases or has little impact on diversity. One impediment toward generalizing grazing effects on diversity in this region is that high levels of interannual variation in precipitation may obfuscate vegetative response patterns. By analyzing a long-term data set collected over a 20-yr period in a semiarid grassland, we explicitly evaluated the role of climate in regulating the effect of cattle grazing on plant communities, finding that climate interacted with grazing intensity to shape grassland communities. Community composition of plots that were intensively grazed varied considerably in response to climatic variation and native species richness was low relative to ungrazed and moderately grazed plots. Following a severe drought in 2002, exotic species richness rapidly increased in the high-intensity grazing plots. While this pattern was mirrored in the other treatments, exotic species richness increased to a greater extent and was slower to return to pre-drought levels in the high-intensity grazing plots. Overall, moderate grazing, even compared to grazing cessation, stabilized grassland communities through time, increased resilience to drought, and maintained the highest levels of native plant diversity and lowest levels of exotic diversity. These findings suggest that grazing, at moderate levels, may support grassland resilience to climate change in semiarid regions. However, grazing that exceeds tolerances, particularly in combination with extreme climatic events, like drought, can alter plant composition over relatively long timescales and possibly increase invasibility by nonnative species. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","cattle grazing; climate change; drought; exotic species; plant diversity; resilience; southwestern United States","annual variation; cattle; climate change; drought; grassland; native species; semiarid region; species diversity; species richness; United States; Bos; animal; biodiversity; bovine; climate change; drought; grassland; plant; Animals; Biodiversity; Cattle; Climate Change; Droughts; Grassland; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072232136

Brazil is the fifth largest producer in the world, and extensive coastal areas of Northeastern Brazil are planted with tall coconut. However, the sustainability of these coconut plantations can be affected by different abiotic stresses, including drought, mineral nutrition, and salinity. So, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the ecophysiological responses of tall coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) adult plants in cultivated and semi-extrativist areas on coast of Ceará state, in Northeastern Brazil. The study was carried out in four areas: Irrigated, Rainfed, Foreiro (coconut trees on coastland owned by the Navy and temporarily rented to private individuals) and Preamar (coconut trees in high-tide areas owned by the Navy). The evaluations (leaf gas exchanges, Na+ on leaf surfaces, leaf concentrations of soluble carbohydrates, N, K, P, and Na, soil moisture, and soil electrical conductivity) were carried out in the dry and rainy seasons, between 2015 and 2017. Our results indicated that tall coconut palms were subjected to abiotic constraints in three of the four evaluated areas. Salinity and waterlogging were evident in Preamar plants; water deficit in Rainfed plants; and nutritional stress limited the crop yield in Rainfed, Preamar, and Foreiro areas. Coconut plants that grew in Foreiro area, despite the proximity to the ocean, were not subjected to salt stress, and the higher moisture in lower soil layers significantly reduced the effect of the dry season on photosynthetic rates. Seawater spray caused accumulation of Na+ on coconut leaf surfaces, mainly in the areas close to the sea. The repeated salinity stress and waterlogging in high-tide area caused a permanent hindrance for carbon assimilation rate, limiting the capacity of fruit production by plants. Current climatic changes leading to the elevation of sea level and intrusion of sea water enhance the general concern on how to maintain these coconut plantations as source of fiber and nutrition to future generations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cocos nucifera L; Mineral nutrition; Photosynthesis; Salt stress; Tropical crops; Water stress","Coastal zones; Crops; Cultivation; Drought; Forestry; Ion exchange; Palm oil; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Sea level; Seawater; Soil moisture; Tropics; Yield stress; Cocos nucifera l; Mineral nutrition; Salt stresss; Tropical crops; Water stress; Nutrition; climate change; crop yield; dry season; fruit production; nut; photosynthesis; sea level; seawater; sustainability; water stress; waterlogging; Brazil; Cocos nucifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079070659

In contrast, it has been demonstrated that heterotrophic microbial communities in soil are primarily limited by organic carbon or energy. While this concept of contrasting limitations, that is, microbial carbon and plant nutrient limitation, is based on strong evidence that we review in this paper, it is often ignored in discussions of ecosystem response to global environment changes. The plant-centric perspective has equated plant nutrient limitations with those of whole ecosystems, thereby ignoring the important role of the heterotrophs responsible for soil decomposition in driving ecosystem carbon storage. To truly integrate carbon and nutrient cycles in ecosystem science, we must account for the fact that while plant productivity may be nutrient limited, the secondary productivity by heterotrophic communities is inherently carbon limited. Ecosystem carbon cycling integrates the independent physiological responses of its individual components, as well as tightly coupled exchanges between autotrophs and heterotrophs. To the extent that the interacting autotrophic and heterotrophic processes are controlled by organisms that are limited by nutrient versus carbon accessibility, respectively, we propose that ecosystems by definition cannot be ‘limited’ by nutrients or carbon alone. Here, we outline how models aimed at predicting non-steady state ecosystem responses over time can benefit from dissecting ecosystems into the organismal components and their inherent limitations to better represent plant–microbe interactions in coupled carbon and nutrient models. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon; decomposition; ecosystem; limitation; microbial carbon limitation; nutrients; plants; soil; soil microorganisms; stoichiometry","autotrophy; carbon cycle; ecosystem response; environmental change; heterotrophy; microbial community; nutrient; soil biota; stoichiometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078806349

In this paper, we systematically studied the sedimentary facies of Jurassic Badaowan Formation in the northern margin piedmont belt of Junggar Basin based on the comprehensive analysis of geological and geophysical data acquired. The results show that under the comprehensive influences of tectonic setting, paleo-provenance and paleo-climate, large-scaled humid alluvial fans are developed in the piedmont belt of Hala'alt mountain. The fluvial activity of alluvial fan is stronger and more stable in the humid type than that in the arid type. Three subfacies are identified in the humid alluvial fan, i.e. the upper fan, middle fan and lower fan. The middle fan can be further divided into braided river channel and the peat bog. Then we build the sedimentary facies model based on the microfacies types and distributions. This model is significantly different from arid alluvial fan in lithologic features, sedimentary sequences, distribution scales and microfacies match patterns. The reservoir distribution is mainly controlled by the favorable microfacies, lithofacies and depositional fabric. We suggest that the braided river channel glutenite lithofacies and grit lithofacies in the middle fan subfacies are the most favorable reservoir facies belt for hydrocarbon accumulation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Braided river channel; Hala'alt mountain; Humid alluvial fan; Hydrocarbon accumulation; Junggar Basin; Sedimentary characteristics","Hydrocarbons; Rivers; Sedimentology; Alluvial fans; Braided river; Hala'alt mountain; Hydrocarbon accumulation; Junggar Basin; Sedimentary characteristics; Landforms; alluvial fan; braided river; humid environment; hydrocarbon reservoir; lithofacies; microfacies; piedmont; river channel; sedimentary sequence; China; Junggar Basin; Xinjiang Uygur; Pandanus tectorius",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076850850

It is necessary to explore solutions complying with the prevailing emission norms in different sectors. Methanol has the potential amongst all primary alcohols for widespread use in transport sector due to its clean-burning, high octane rating, sources of production like high ash coal, and biomass. The addition of methanol to gasoline can significantly reduce engine-out emissions. Gasoline-Methanol blends (Gasohols) can be used to reduce dependence of the transport sector on fossil fuels. This study deals with investigation of spray characteristics of methanol-gasoline blends as it affects engine performance and emissions characteristics to a great extent. Macroscopic and microscopic spray characteristics of different gasohols such as M15 (15% methanol blended with 85% gasoline, v/v), M85 (85% methanol blended with 15% gasoline, v/v), M100 (100% methanol), and G100 (100% Gasoline) were experimentally investigated using a port fuel multi-hole solenoid injector. A Constant Volume Spray Chamber (CVSC) having glass windows was used for the experiments at a chamber pressure of 1 bar. The fuel injection pressure was maintained at 3.5 bar. The results showed that addition of methanol in gasoline does not have significant effect on macroscopic characteristics like spray penetration length and spray cone angle. On the hand, methanol addition in gasoline has considerable effect on microscopic characteristics. Gasoline showed better atomization behavior compared to other test fuels. Methanol addition shifted the droplet distribution towards the region of higher droplet diameter and velocity. © 2020 SAE International.

It is well-known that textile manufacturing consumes considerable amount of energy. The textile factory in this case study is located at Bang Poo Industrial Estate in Samut Prakarn province, Thailand. It is categorized as a midstream sector and has been consuming final energy in terms of 87% thermal energy (steam) and 13% electrical energy. The factory had 6 fire-tube steam boilers having capacity of 40 tons steam per hour. The age of the existing boilers was longer than 20 years. Therefore, it was decided to install a cogeneration system to replace the existing boilers for energy saving, safety integrity and CO2 emission reduction. The gas turbine topping cycle cogeneration system with waste heat recovery was selected due to several advantages such as low energy consumption, high boiler efficiency and high energy efficiency. Considering the energy and environmental issues, the results showed 92% overall efficiency, 19.5% primary energy or natural gas savings, and 38.6% reduction of CO2 emission when compared to the separated heat and power system.

Therefore, the distributions of forest plantations and natural stands might already be facing such impacts. We selected the most arid zone of south-eastern Europe (eastern Andalusia) to assess how the distributions of Pinus halepensis Miller. and Pinus pinaster Aiton forest plantations and natural stands cope with climate change and to determine whether natural or planted distributions would be more stable under future climate-change scenarios. We used presence-point locations from natural distributions, obtained from the third Spanish National Forest Inventory, to develop ensemble species distribution models. The forecast predicted a slight increase in the potential distribution of both species by 2040, with a subsequent drastic decrease until 2099. Pinus halepensis had larger current and future potential distributions than P. pinaster but a slightly greater decrease with time in the potential distribution than that of P. pinaster. On the other hand, the natural and planted distributions of P. halepensis were more vulnerable to future climate change scenarios than those of P. pinaster.

The rehabilitation of deteriorated structures by using externally bonded fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites is gaining popularity in the construction sector owing to its high strength, optimum durability and compatibility with concrete structures during application. This paper aims to review the current state-of-the-art on the performances, challenges and future opportunities of FRP-strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) structures under different loading scenarios. FRP strengthening leads to satisfactory performances under static, dynamic and extreme environmental conditions. Debonding and FRP rupture are the common types of failure observed, however, the failure mechanisms operating under the combined action of service loads and environmental exposures are still unclear. The acceptance and application of FRPs in strengthening RC structures will further increase upon developing techniques for utilising the full FRP strength, reducing the brittleness, risk of fires and accidental damage, minimising the energy consumption as well as carbon emission during production, and reducing the high initial cost.

The electric vehicles provide positive impacts such as instant torque delivery, overall vehicle comfort, noise and vibration. They also provide local environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, there are some major complexities for EVs to overcome before completely replacing ICE vehicles.

Utilization of these lands not only produces high economic value products, but also contributes in providing environmental services, including carbon sequestration. This study aims to measure aboveground carbon stock of agroforestry and agricultural monoculture systems in Rasau Jaya, Kubu Raya Regency, West Kalimantan Province. The agroforestry system observed is divided based on the level of peat depth, which are 0-2 m and 3-4 m. The pattern of agroforestry at a depth of 0-2 m is a combination of timber and non timber tree species and agricultural crops, while the pattern of agroforestry at a depth of 3-4 m is a combination of timber and non-timber tree species and plantation crops. Timber tree species are Pulai (Alstonia pneumatohara) and Gerunggang (Cratoxylon arborescens Bl); the non-timber tree species is jelutung (Dyera costulata); and plantation crop species are Jengkol (Archidendron pauciflorum) and Pinang (Areca catechu); and the agricultural crops are peanuts, cayenne pepper, tomatoes, bitter melon and eggplant. Observations were also conductedon the agricultural monoculture pattern, including the eggplant, chili, bitter melon and tomato. The components of measured carbon stocks are plant biomass (trees and lower plants), wooden necromasses, non-woody necromasses, and wild plant biomass. The measurement results show a shallow peat agroforestry system (0-2 m) with a combination of one year old trees and agricultural crops contributing to carbon stock of 0.8 tons/ha. Deep peat agroforestry systems (3-4m) with a combination of timber trees, non-timber trees and plantation crops contribute to carbon stocks of 3 tons/ha.

In line with the national policy, South Sumatra Province commits to reduce emissions, including emissions from forest and land fires. This research was aimed to assess carbon loss affected by fire in 2015 that covered three districts in South Sumatra, i.e. Musi Banyuasin, Banyuasin, and Musi Rawas. The study was conducted by re-measurement of carbon stocks plots on four forests and land types, i.e. secondary peat swamp forest, secondary dryland forest, bushes swamp, and forest plantation. Carbon stocks measuring was conducted on sample plots in a rectangular shape of 20 m x 50 m of size for various types of natural forests and circle shape with a radius of 11.29 m (0.04 ha) and 7.98 m (0.02 ha) respectively for forest plantations of < 4 years and > 4 years old. Furthermore, carbon stocks in each plot were measured for three carbon pools of above-ground biomass, deadwood and litter. The result shows that carbon loss was varying with each forest and land type. The most significant number of carbon loss occurred on secondary peat swamp forest of 94.2 t/ha that is equivalent to the emission of 345.4 t CO2eq. The second-largest carbon loss occurred on secondary dryland forest of 36.3 t/ha followed by forest plantation and bushes swamp of 18.5 t/ha and 13.5 t/ha, respectively. The enormous carbon loss on secondary peat swamp forest and forest plantation occurred on above-ground biomass pool but in secondary dry forest and bushes swamp occurred on the deadwood pool. ©2020 IJFR.","And forest types; Carbon loss; Forest fires",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091067546

Enhanced by an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method, a ventilation controller is developed to regulate the forced air ventilation in a road tunnel. As a result, the pollutants (particulate matter and carbon monoxide) are reduced by actively regulating the air flow rate through the tunnel. The key contribution of this study lies in the development of an extended state observer that can track the system disturbance and provide the system with compensation via a nonlinear state feedback controller equipped by the ADRC. The proposed method enhances the disturbance attenuation capability in the ventilation system and keeps the pollutant concentration within the legitimate limit in the tunnel. In addition to providing a safe and clean environment for passengers, the improved tunnel ventilation can also achieve better energy saving as the air flow rate is optimized. © 2020 by the authors.

From the mid-1980s industrial Hg loads into HB decreased dramatically until their complete cessation in 2000. Consequently, concentrations in marine biota and sediments decreased almost to reference levels. However, during 2006–2014, an unexpected increase of total Hg (THg) concentrations was observed in three commercial fish species collected at northern HB (N.HB). To determine the cause of this increase, THg and methyl Hg (MeHg) were measured in seawater, coastal groundwater, suspended particulate matter, plankton, macroalgae, benthic fauna, and in marine and beach sediments. THg in groundwater and sediments from the vicinity of ECI were extremely high (up to 251 μg L−1 and 2200 ng g−1, respectively). MeHg concentrations in groundwater were low and constituted &lt;0.1% of THg, except in the surf zone opposite the ECI, where MeHg constituted 0.2% of the THg. THg and MeHg concentrations were consistently higher in benthic biota and plankton from N.HB and northwards, compared to corresponding samples from southern HB (S.HB) and the reference site (RS). MeHg in bivalves and sponges from N.HB and SZ was higher than from S.HB and RS, despite having similar THg concentrations, which suggests a stronger source of MeHg in N.HB. Our findings suggest that the discharge into N.HB of Hg polluted groundwater under the ECI increased during the period 2006–2014. The Hg was assimilated by plankton or adsorbed onto inorganic particles, which were further ingested by benthic and pelagic consumers, as well as transported northward with the alongshore current. These findings demonstrate for the first time the potential of relic pollution in groundwater to increase heavy metal burdens in local marine food webs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Groundwater; Legacy pollution; Marine biota; Mercury; Methyl mercury","Chemical contamination; Groundwater; Heavy metals; Marine pollution; Mercury (metal); Plankton; River pollution; Suspended sediments; Alongshore current; Chlor-alkali plants; Coastal groundwater; Inorganic particles; Marine biota; Methyl mercury; Reference levels; Suspended particulate matters; Groundwater pollution; mercury; methylmercury; sea water; ground water; mercury; methylmercury derivative; biota; commercial species; concentration (composition); food web; groundwater pollution; mercury (element); methylmercury; pollutant source; Article; benthic fauna; bivalve; coastal waters; comparative study; concentration (parameter); consumer; Crambe (sponge); food web; groundwater pollution; macroalga; nonhuman; pelagic species; plankton; priority journal; sea pollution; suspended particulate matter; water pollution; animal; bay; environmental monitoring; food chain; Israel; water pollutant; Haifa Bay; Israel; Bivalvia; Animals; Bays; Environmental Monitoring; Food Chain; Groundwater; Israel; Mercury; Methylmercury Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078204103

Controlled potential electrolysis showed that the catalysts are effective for electrochemical CO2-reduction, yielding CO as the product (in MeCN for the Re-complex, in 95:5 (v/v) MeCN:H2O mixture for the Mn-complex). The recyclability of the catalysts was demonstrated through replenishment of CO2 within solution. The novel catalysts had similar reduction potentials to previously reported complexes of similar structure, and results of the foot-of-the-wave analysis showed comparable maximum turnover rates, too. The tentative mechanisms for activation of the pre-catalysts were proposed on the basis of IR-spectroelectrochemical data aided by DFT calculations. It is shown that the typical dimerisation of the Mn-catalyst was prevented by incorporation of sterically hindering groups, whilst the Re-catalyst undergoes the usual mechanism following chloride ion loss. No photochemical CO2 reduction was observed for the rhenium complex in the presence of a sacrificial donor (triethylamine), which was attributed to the short triplet excited state lifetime (3.6 ns), insufficient for diffusion-controlled electron transfer. Importantly, [Mn(HPEAB)(CO)3Br] can act as a CO2 reduction catalyst when photosensitised by a zinc porphyrin under red light irradiation (λ &gt; 600 nm) in MeCN:H2O (95:5); there has been only one reported example of photoactivating Mn-catalysts with porphyrins in this manner. Thus, this work demonstrates the wide utility of sterically protected Re- A nd Mn-diimine carbonyl catalysts, where the rate and yield of CO-production can be adjusted based on the metal centre and catalytic conditions, with the advantage of suppressing unwanted side-reactions through steric protection of the vacant coordination site.

Though extensive epidemiological data are available in the United States, they are largely limited to select large cities, and hence, most projections estimate the potential impact of future warming on a subset of the U.S. population. Here we utilize evaluations of the relative risk of premature death associated with temperature in 10 U.S. cities spanning a wide range of climate conditions to develop a generalized risk function. We first evaluate the performance of this generalized function, which introduces substantial biases at the individual city level but performs well at the large scale. We then apply this function to estimate the impacts of projected climate change on heat-related nationwide U.S. deaths under a range of scenarios. During the current decade, there are 12,000 (95% confidence interval 7,400–16,500) premature deaths annually in the contiguous United States, much larger than most estimates based on totals for select individual cities. These values increase by 97,000 (60,000–134,000) under the high-warming Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario and by 36,000 (22,000–50,000) under the moderate RCP4.5 scenario by 2100, whereas they remain statistically unchanged under the aggressive mitigation scenario RCP2.6. These results include estimates of adaptation that reduce impacts by ~40–45% as well as population increases that roughly offset adaptation. The results suggest that the degree of climate change mitigation will have important health impacts on Americans. ©2020.

Despite the expansion of abandoned fields in temperate humid areas worldwide, little is known about how ecosystem C stock and its partitioning change with secondary succession, especially under the invasion of non-native, fast-growing plants. Using a paired-plot approach, we investigated how plant community type (native vs. non-native, the latter represented by Solidago altissima) influences temporal changes in ecosystem C pools in abandoned paddy fields. Thirty-seven plots of control (paddy) and abandoned (2–37 years of succession) pair having similar soil types under the humid temperate climate of Japan were selected for this study. We detected a net loss of ecosystem C in the first 15.2 years, followed by a gradual C gain. Apparent maximal C gain (up to 10 Mg C ha−1) was observed approximately 30 years after abandonment, based on a smooth spline model. The initial C loss was largely attributed to decomposition in mineral-associated soil C, owing presumably to the rapid decay of the C accumulated under temporally anaerobic paddy. While no detectable difference was found in the ecosystem C stock between plots dominated by S. altissima and native plants, the S. altissima-dominated plots showed significantly lower litter C stock. We therefore conclude that, despite the rapid growth and high aboveground biomass of S. altissima, its invasion did not increase ecosystem C storage in the studied region; these findings highlight the absence of ecological benefits associated with S. altissima invasion. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Agricultural abandonment; Land-use change; Litter; Native plants; Non-native plants; Paddy; Secondary succession; Soil carbon; Solidago altissima","abandoned land; aboveground biomass; biological invasion; carbon sequestration; decomposition; ecosystem dynamics; invasive species; leaf litter; paddy field; plant community; Japan; Solidago canadensis var. scabra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070191779

The absence of metals is expected to prevent gas from efficient cooling and fragmentation in theory. However, this effect has not yet been observed in low-metallicity environments, such as in the early universe and local dwarf galaxies, because of the lack of high-spatial-resolution maps of gas. We carried out Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the carbon monoxide (CO) J = 2-1 emission line at 1.4 parsec resolutions of a molecular cloud in DDO 70 at 7% solar metallicity, the most metal-poor galaxy currently known with a CO detection. In total, five clumps have been identified and they are found to more or less follow Larson's law. Since the CO emission exists in regions with visual extinction A V around 1.0, we converted this A V to the gas-mass surface density using a gas-to-dust ratio of 4594 ± 2848 for DDO 70. We found that the CO clumps in DDO 70 exhibit significantly larger (on average four times) sizes than those at the same gas-mass surface densities in the massive star formation regions of the Milky Way. The existence of such large clumps appears to be consistent with theoretical expectations that gas fragmentation in low-metallicity clouds is suppressed. While our observation is only for one cloud in the galaxy, if it is representative, the above result implies suppressed gas fragmentation during the cloud collapse and star formation in the early universe. © 2020 The American Astronomical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085141776

In this study, three disposal lines are considered to convert the KW into clean and renewable energy products, during which a Stackelberg equilibrium-based model is developed to achieve a balance between cost savings, carbon emissions reduction and profit making by considering the interests of the local government and KW disposal plants. A practical case is then conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed methodology, after which scenario analyses are conducted and practical suggestions are given. The government subsidy was positively correlated with cost investment and economic profits, with peak values arriving at 545 thousand CNY and 388 thousand CNY respectively, while the wet KW proportions (WKP) had a positive impact on carbon emissions and economic profits, reaching 596 tons and 457 thousand CNY respectively. The proposed methodology was found efficiently enough to regulate KW disposal, resolve ecological and economic (eco-economic) conflicts and achieve sustainable social development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-economic equilibrium; Energy products; Kitchen waste; Recycle; Sustainable development","Carbon; Emission control; Investments; Kitchens; Planning; Profitability; Recycling; Sustainable development; Carbon emissions reductions; Eco-economic; Ecological and economic; Energy products; Environmental pollutions; Kitchen waste; Stackelberg equilibrium; Sustainable social development; Waste disposal; carbon emission; cost analysis; domestic waste; economic activity; equilibrium; recycling; resource use; sustainable development; waste disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079416804

Considering the increasing spatial interaction of the carbon emission of URBs (URBCE) in the region, this study investigates the influence of climate and economic factors on the URBCE in North and South China. First, the URBCE is calculated by using a decomposition energy balance table based on the carbon emission coefficient of electric and thermal power, thereby improving the estimation of the basic data of URBCE. Second, the influence of economic and climatic factors on the URBCE intensity in 30 provinces of China is explored by using a spatial econometric model. Results show that the URBCE intensity in China had a spatial autocorrelation from 2000 to 2016. Climatic and economic factors have great differences in the degree and direction of influencing the URBCE intensity in the country. Formulating emission reduction policies for climate or economic zones is more scientific and effective than developing national policies. Among these factors, urbanization rate, climate, and GDP per capita have a significant positive impact on the URBCE intensity in the region, whereas other factors have varying degrees of negative impact. In addition, climate, consumption level, and building area have significant spatial spillover effects on URBCE intensity, whereas other factors do not pass the significance test. Relevant conclusions should be given pecial attention by policymakers. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Influencing factors; Residential buildings; Spatial agglomeration; Spillover effect","building; carbon emission; economic conditions; environmental economics; geographical region; Gross Domestic Product; policy making; spatiotemporal analysis; suburbanization; testing method; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083682490

Photoelectrochemical cells with CO2-containing NaCl aqueous solution as an electrolyte and n-GaN films as photoelectrodes offer an environmentally friendly system to generate energy under sunlight. The typical production rates of HCOOH and H2 generated from the n-GaN photoelectrodes with TiO2/Ag NP composite layers are markedly higher than those for the n-GaN photoelectrodes without the TiO2/Ag NPs. The transmission spectra obtained from the TiO2/Ag NP/n-GaN photoelectrodes exhibited an additional visible light absorption band at around 550 nm due to localized surface plasmon resonance effect, except for the ultraviolet absorption with a wavelength of lower than 365 nm. However, the additional visible absorption was not the main cause of the enhancement of H2 and HCOOH production rates. Instead, the enhancement was mainly due to the remarkable improvement in texture at the photoelectrode/TiO2 interface.

This paper introduces a novel supply chain network design problem to cover three dimensions of sustainability, namely economic, environmental, and social. The advantage of the presented model stems from considering the booming development aligned with reduction in environmental impact. In this paper, to achieve the mentioned benefits and to derive a more sustainable supply chain, a novel model in the presence of the most commonly used carbon policies is proposed. This paper, addresses sustainable development through imposing proper carbon regulatory mechanisms. Main contribution of this study is to consider the effect of imposing carbon policies on environmental advantages as well as improving the regional development level in a supply chain network design problem. Moreover, the shipment consolidation decisions are utilized to reduce cost as well as environmental impact. In addition, a novel mixed uncertainty approach is proposed to capture the uncertain emission parameters. The numerical examples and a case study are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. It is concluded that, a high-growth economy with low-carbon can be made and also almost global well-being of people is ensured by applying the proposed model. Some managerial insights are provided for the enterprises of supply chains to make the most appropriate sustainable decisions. Finally, proper carbon emission policies are suggested based on the region sustainability characteristics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon policies; Robust optimization; Shipment consolidation; Supply chain network design; Sustainability","Carbon; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Optimization; Planning; Regional planning; Ships; Supply chain management; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon policy; Emission parameters; Regional development; Regulatory mechanism; Robust optimization; Supply chain network design; Sustainability issues; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable development; carbon emission; emission control; environmental policy; network design; optimization; pollution policy; regulatory approach; supply chain management; sustainability; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079902713

Here, analysis of ambient monitoring data of six criteria air pollutants from 367 Chinese cities during 2015–2018, showed that PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and CO were reduced significantly by 22.1%, 13.5%, 46.4% and 21.5%, respectively, NO2 reduction was less significant (6.3%) while O3 level instead increased over China (13.7%). Spatial distribution, seasonal, monthly and diurnal variations of the air pollutants during 2018, implicated of effective control measures, were discussed in details, especially for the five key densely populated regions of Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ), Fen Wei Plains (FWP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Sichuan Basin (SCB) and Pearl River Delta (PRD). Moreover, excess health risks (ERs) of the six pollutants were estimated for 2018, and such risks was two times higher if the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guideline rather than Chinese guideline was adopted. PM10 rather than PM2.5 was the dominant contributor to ERs, and the case with both PM2.5 and PM10 exceeding threshold values occupied ~1/3 of total days, yet contributed ~2/3 of total ERs. For 2018, the health-risk based air quality index (HAQI) was further calculated by combining health risks from multiple pollutants, and it was found that high HAQI mostly distributed in North China Plain (NCP). ~15%, ~85% and ~95% people in YRD, FWP and JJJ were exposed to polluted air (HAQI &gt; 100), and population-normalized HAQI further added the inequality, JJJ and a small region of SCB had much higher HAQI (&gt;280). Investigations on HAQI with socioeconomic factors show that total population, population density and built-up area presented an inverted U-shape, suggesting existence of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), while a positive relationship was found between HAQI and share of secondary industry. Multiple regression analysis suggested that built-up area was the most prominent factor to HAQI, followed by the gross domestic product (GDP). The findings here demonstrate in great details the current characteristics of air pollution and its associated health risks in China, therefore providing important implications for effective air pollution control strategies in near future for different regions of China. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollutants; Air pollution; Annual variations; Health risks; Socioeconomic factors","Air pollution; Air quality; Economics; Health; Health risks; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Risk perception; River pollution; Spatial distribution; Air pollutants; Annual variations; Densely populated regions; Environmental Kuznets curves; Gross domestic products; Multiple regression analysis; Socio-economic factor; World Health Organization; Air pollution control; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; silicon dioxide; air quality; ambient air; annual variation; atmospheric pollution; health risk; particulate matter; pollution control; socioeconomic status; spatial distribution; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; controlled study; environmental monitoring; gross national product; health hazard; particulate matter; population density; practice guideline; priority journal; seasonal variation; socioeconomics; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution; city; environmental health; environmental monitoring; human; risk assessment; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079196628

Therefore, the present study focuses to supplement the existing information by estimating carbon stocks in temperate forests dominated by Cedrus deodara along the altitudinal gradients in the Central Himalaya. Three altitudes i.e., lower (1750 m), middle (1900 m) and upper (2050 m) of the stand was considered to understand and estimate biomass and soil carbon storage potential of the forests based on the standard protocol. The results showed that the soil carbon stock (SOC) decreased significantly with increasing soil depths and altitudes. Litterfall production in the forests varied adversely with altitude. Above and below-ground biomass carbon stock also decreased along with altitude. The study observed that the total carbon stock (soil, trees and forest floor) of the Cedrus deodara forest in different altitudes was 395.4 t ha−1 (lower altitude), 321.6 t ha−1 (middle altitude) and 282.5 t ha−1 (upper altitude).

Poor productivity of apple orchards in Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) is due to lack of information on the variability of soil properties important for enhancing productivity in the region. The study was conducted in apple orchards with the hypothesis that spatial variability of soil properties is high due to adoption of varied management and passive soil factors. The major objectives of the study were to assess the spatial variability of soil parameters, viz. soil pH, electrical conductivity, soil organic carbon along with plant available soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), exchangeable calcium (Ca), and exchangeable magnesium (Mg) at a regional scale through geostatistical methods. Coefficient of variation (CV) indicated that the fertility parameters varied from medium to high in heterogeneity (CV > 20%). Available N was found critical/medium in 69.6% of soil samples and might be one of the limiting nutrients for crop growth, P and K were in high, and OC in very high range. Significant correlation was found between OC with N; pH with K, Ca and Mg and EC with OC, P and K. The semivariogram parameters indicated that the spatial distribution of soil fertility parameters were inconsistent and showed strong to weak degree of spatial dependence for all parameters.

First, key related functional traits and their weights for measuring each ecosystem service were determined using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Potential of each landscape to supply each ecosystem service was determined through abundance and functional values of species in providing that service. Results showed that highland rangelands had the highest potential for forage production, medical source, fuel, carbon stock, wind erosion control and water regulation. The highest potential for pollination, honey and aesthetic belonged to hillside sites. Arid plain site provided the least ecosystem services in the study region. There were significant relationships between species diversity and ecosystem services forage, medical sources and aesthetic. Richness did not represent potential of arid and semi-arid rangeland landscapes to supply multiple ecosystem services. Climate was the main factor in driving multiple ecosystem services across landscape gradient. Pearson's correlation revealed a synergy between pollination, honey and aesthetic and they tradeoff with water regulation, carbon stock, medical source, wind erosion control. Soil fertility as a supporting service was correlated with other ecosystem services. Our approach provides useful information to identify ecosystem potential in supplying multiple ecosystem services and to assist ecological interventions for supporting multiple ecosystem services in different rangeland landscapes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Ecosystem service; Functional trait; Tradeoff","Biodiversity; Carbon; Correlation methods; Erosion; Food products; Ecosystem services; Forage production; Functional traits; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Natural landscapes; Semi-arid rangeland; Tradeoff; Trait-based approaches; Ecosystems; biodiversity; correlation; ecosystem service; functional change; landscape change; multicriteria analysis; rangeland; trade-off",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075854236

Establishing a regionally-specific EF usually requires the measurement of a whole year of N2O emissions, whereas most studies measure N2O emissions only during the crop growing season, neglecting emissions during non-growing periods. However, the difference in N2O-EF (ΔEF) estimated using measurements over a whole year (EFwy) and those based on measurement only during the crop-growing season (EFgs) has received little attention. Here, we selected 21 studies including both the whole-year and growing-season N2O emissions under control and fertilizer treatments, to obtain 123 ΔEFs from various agroecosystems globally. Using these data, we conducted a meta-analysis of the ΔEFs by bootstrapping resampling to assess the magnitude of differences in response to management-related and environmental factors. The results revealed that, as expected, the EFwy was significantly greater than the EFgs for most crop types. Vegetables showed the largest ΔEF (0.19%) among all crops (0.07%), followed by paddy rice (0.11%). A higher ΔEF was also identified in areas with rainfall ≥600 mm yr−1, soil with organic carbon ≥1.3% and acidic soils. Moreover, fertilizer type, residue management, irrigation regime and duration of the non-growing season were other crucial factors controlling the magnitude of the ΔEFs. We also found that neglecting emissions from the non-growing season may underestimate the N2O-EF by 30% for paddy fields, almost three times that for non-vegetable upland crops. This study highlights the importance of the inclusion of the non-growing season in the measurements of N2O fluxes, the compilation of national inventories and the design of mitigation strategies. Fallow-season N2O emissions must be included when calculating emission factors (EFs); neglecting them lowers the EFs by 30% for paddy rice and 10% for non-vegetable crops. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fallow; Greenhouse gas; Nitrogen use efficiency; Nitrous oxide; Residual fertilizer N","Crops; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Soils; Vegetables; Agricultural management; Emission inventories; Environmental factors; Fallow; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide emission factors; Residual fertilizer n; Cultivation; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizer; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; rain; fertilizer; nitrous oxide; agricultural emission; emission control; estimation method; fertilizer; greenhouse gas; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; seasonal variation; agroecosystem; air temperature; Article; bootstrapping; bulk density; cropland; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental management; evapotranspiration; growing season; irrigation (agriculture); maize; nitrogen cycling; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; precipitation; rice; soil acidity; soil temperature; wheat; agriculture; chemistry; China; crop; meta analysis; metabolism; Oryza; soil; Agriculture; China; Crops, Agricultural; Fertilizers; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077039819

A real-time catalyst temperature model provides critical information to the engine control system. In order to improve emissions and ensure regulatory compliance over a wide range of speed-load conditions, it is desirable to use modelled catalyst temperature as the primary input to catalyst efficiency control strategies. This requirement creates a challenge for traditional empirical models designed for component protection at high speed-load conditions. Simulation results show that a physics aligned model can estimate temperature in all operating conditions, including: Cold-start, extended idle, engine shutdown, stop-start events, deceleration fuel shut-off, as well as traditional high load and part load points. However, physics based approaches which calculate detailed chemical reaction kinetics remain impractical for real-time controller implementation due to computational burden and calibration complexity. This paper outlines a proposal for a simplified control-oriented physics model which estimates catalyst temperature in real time. The model consists of reduced order exothermic reaction kinetics in conjunction with gas phase and solid phase energy balance equations. The control-oriented physics model is verified in both steady-state and transient drive cycles and shown to provide increased estimation accuracy while reducing transient calibration effort when compared to a traditional empirical model. © 2020 FCA US LLC.",,"Association reactions; Calibration; Catalysts; Catalytic converters; Compliance control; Dielectric properties; Reaction kinetics; Regulatory compliance; Automotive emissions; Energy balance equations; Engine control system; Real time controllers; Steady state and transients; Temperature estimation; Three way catalytic converter; Transient calibrations; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083846812

In addition, we incorporated two dynamic of systems models of bocachico fish population and mercury accumulation in the Cienaga. The simulations indicate that the Cienaga levels can be affected by extreme changes in rainfall associated with ENSO. The model estimates the fraction of water that could enter from the Cauca River due to levee breaks. Furthermore, using a fish dynamic population we could project the population and catch of bocachico. Finally, the mercury balance model due to mining in the region help to estimate mercury concentrations in water, fish and aquatic macrophytes matrices.

By contrast, diversity in soil microorganisms is generally considered as mostly driven by edaphic variables and, therefore, difficult to extrapolate on a large spatial scale based on predictive models. Here, we compared the power of topo-climatic versus edaphic variables for predicting the diversity of various soil protist groups at the regional scale. Location: Swiss western Alps. Taxa: Full protist community and nine clades belonging respectively to three functional groups: parasites (Apicomplexa, Peronosporomycetes and Phytomyxea), phagotrophs (Sarcomonadea, Tubulinea and Spirotrichea) and phototrophs (Chlorophyta, Trebouxiophyceae and Diatomeae). Methods: We extracted soil DNA from 178 sites along a wide range of elevations with a random-stratified sampling design. We defined protist Operational Taxonomic Units assemblages by metabarcoding of the V4 region of the rRNA small subunit gene. We assessed and modelled the diversity (Shannon index) patterns of all above-mentioned taxonomic groups based on topo-climatic (topography, slope southness, slope steepness and average summer temperature) and edaphic (soil temperature, relative humidity, pH, electroconductivity, phosphorus percentage, carbon/nitrogen, loss on ignition and shale percentage) variables in Generalized Additive Models (GAM). Results: The respective significance of topo-climatic and edaphic variables varied among taxonomic and—to a certain extent—functional groups: while many variables explained significantly the diversity of the three phototrophs this was less the case for the three parasites. Topo-climatic variables had a better predictive power than edaphic variables, yet predictive power varied among taxonomic groups. Main conclusions: Topo-climatic variables (particularly slope steepness and summer temperature if we consider their significance in the GAMs) were, on average, better predictors of protist diversity at the landscape scale than edaphic variables. However, the predictive power of these variables on diversity differed considerably among taxonomic groups; such relationships may be due to direct and/or indirect (e.g. biotic) influences (like with parasitic taxa, where low predictive power is most likely explained by the absence of information on the hosts’ distribution). Future prospects include using such spatial models to predict hotspots of diversity and disease outbreaks. © 2019 The Authors.

The European community committed to reduce the ammonia emissions by 30% by the year 2030 compared to 2005. After a moderate initial reduction, the last report showed no further improvements in the last four years, keeping the 30% reduction a very challenging target for the next decade. In this study, the mitigation effect of different types of tannin and tannin-based adsorbent on the ammonia emission from manure was investigated. Firstly, we conducted a template study monitoring the ammonia emissions registered by addition of the tannin-based powders to a 0.1% ammonia solution and then we repeated the experiments with ready-to-spread farm-made manure slurry. The results showed that all tannin-based powders induced sensible reduction of pH and ammonia emitted. Reductions higher than 75% and 95% were registered for ammonia solution and cattle slurry, respectively, when using flavonoid-based powders. These findings are very promising considering that tannins and their derivatives will be extensively available due to the increasing interest on their exploitation for the synthesis of new-generation “green” materials. © 2020 by the authors.

The settlement rapidly expanded under favourable monsoonal climate conditions when architectural elements such as the Citadel, Bailey, Lower and Middle Town were added between the Early and mid-Mature Harappan periods. Abundant local mangroves grew around the GRK sustaining prolific populations of the edible gastropod Terebralia palustris. Oxygen isotope (δ18O) sclerochronology of Early Harappan gastropod shell suggests seasonal mixing of some depleted (δ18O ~ −12‰) river water in summer/monsoon months (through ancient Saraswati and/or Indus distributary channels) with seawater that periodically inundated the GRK. Evaporation from this semi-enclosed water body during the non-monsoon months enriched the δ18O of water/shell carbonates. The humid fluvial landscape possibly changed due to a catastrophic drought driving the final collapse of the settlement of Dholavira exactly at the onset of the Meghalayan (Late Holocene) stage (~4300–4100 years BP).

Rangeland productivity varies on both spatial and temporal scales and provides the major source of feed for livestock. Rangeland productivity is expected to decline with climate change thereby reducing livestock feed availability and consequently livelihoods that depend on livestock. This study was carried out to assess the impacts of climate change on rangeland productivity and consequently livestock population dynamics using a 30-year simulation modeling approach. The climate scenarios used in the simulations are built from the localized predictions by General Circulation Models (GCMs). The primary climate variables under consideration are rainfall (+/-7% change), carbon dioxide (CO2 up to 650 ppm) and temperature (+4 °C change). This was done by applying the SAVANNA ecosystem model which simulates rangeland processes and demographic responses of herbivores on a temporal and spatial scale using a weekly internal time step and monthly spatial and temporal outputs. The results show that rainfall levels of less than 600 mm/year have the largest negative effect on herbaceous biomass production. The amount of biomass from the woody layer does not change much during the year. The carbon dioxide (CO2) effects are more influential on the tree and shrub layers (C3 plants) than the herbaceous layer (C4 grasses). The CO2 effect was more dominant than the effects of rainfall and temperature. In the baseline simulations, the shrub plant layer increased significantly over 30 years while there is a three-fold increase in the woody plant layer (trees and shrubs) where biomass increased from a 1980 production to that of 2010. The biomass of the herbaceous layer was stable over the historical period (1980 to 2010) with values fluctuating between 200 and 400 g/m2. Grass green biomass has a variable distribution where most production occurred in the fields and cleared areas while lower levels of production were found in the forested areas. The spatial distribution of shrub green biomass was less directly linked to yearly rainfall. Shrub biomass was mostly found in forested areas, and it showed a steady increase in production. Cattle, donkey, and goat populations rose slowly from 1980 but the rise was disrupted by a dry period during the late 1980s to the early 1990s causing a decline in all populations primarily due to grass unavailability. The populations of cattle goats and donkeys started to rise again from 1995 onwards due to improvements in rainfall. Cattle and donkey populations were rising faster than that of goats while sheep population was not changing much for most of the simulation period, otherwise they declined significantly during the drought of 2002. Similar changes in simulated grass biomass (g/m2) were observed in almost all climate scenarios, except for the peak and low years. The livestock population simulation showed few variations in livestock population under all scenarios. The main conclusion from the study is that CO2 effects on rangeland productivity are much more dominant than the localized effects of rainfall and temperature. This has implications of favoring the growth of the tree and shrub layers over herbaceous layer, which meant that in the long run, the species that are able to use tree and shrub layers may be kept as a livelihood source as they will have a feed source. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; CO2 effects; Livestock; Rangeland productivity; SAVANNA; Scenarios; Simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083161227

There are three critical requirements for still having a chance, if rapidly diminishing, of keep global warming below the IPCC goal of 1.5°C, namely, demilitarization of the global economy, global solarization of energy supplies coupled with rapid phase out of fossil fuels, and the transformation of agriculture to agroecologies. Degrowth proposals for the global energy supply would not provide the energy capacity for climate mitigation and adaptation, and would fall short of creating equity between the global South and North, in particular by keeping most of humanity in a state of energy poverty.

Telehealth is becoming an accepted way to improve patient access to specialist healthcare. Over 200,000 Australian’s have hepatitis C virus (HCV) and new treatments are very effective and well tolerated. We aim to demonstrate that HCV treatment utilising telehealth support for care delivery has cure rates similar to onsite care in clinical trials. We also report length of consultation and calculate reductions in travel and carbon output. Methods: Patient demographic, clinical, and treatment outcome data were collected prospectively from hospital software and analysed retrospectively. This was an audit of all patients treated for HCV in one year from a single tertiary hospital that included telehealth in their care delivery. Results: Sustained virological response was achieved in 51/52 (98%) patients with completed treatment courses, and 51/58 (88%) of those who had a planned telehealth consultation as part of their management. A median of 634 km of patient travel was saved per telehealth consultation. Discussion: We found that a telehealth-supported outreach programme for patients in regional Australia with HCV produced similar outcomes to clinical trials. There was a considerable saving in time and cost for the patients and significant environmental benefit through the reduction in carbon footprint associated with travel to distant specialist health services. We conclude that telehealth facilitated outreach is a feasible and effective way to access HCV treatment and cure in regional Australia. © The Author(s) 2018.","direct-acting antiviral; Hepatitis C; immigrant; outreach; telehealth","antivirus agent; benzimidazole derivative; carbamic acid derivative; daclatasvir; fluorene derivative; imidazole derivative; ledipasvir; pyrrolidine derivative; sofosbuvir; valine; adult; aged; Australia; female; health care delivery; hepatitis C; human; male; middle aged; organization and management; retrospective study; telemedicine; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Australia; Benzimidazoles; Carbamates; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Fluorenes; Health Services Accessibility; Hepatitis C; Humans; Imidazoles; Male; Middle Aged; Pyrrolidines; Retrospective Studies; Sofosbuvir; Telemedicine; Treatment Outcome; Valine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059639485

These goals are being accomplished by the usage of start-stop-systems, electric boosting while accelerating and recuperation of kinetic energy during braking phases. The latter one is predominantly limited by the charge acceptance of conventional lead-acid starter batteries. Thus, sophisticated power nets are being developed and a new 48 V voltage level has been established in the last years. In comparison to the standard 12 V grid, this new level is characterized by high power capability in order to accept high charging currents during recuperative braking and also provides high discharge currents for boosting. This paper characterizes lithium titanate oxide cells suited for high power applications, such as in automotive 48 V systems, and emphasizes restrictions using state-of-the-art modeling approaches in terms of state of available power and state of charge. Therefore, open circuit behavior is analyzed in dependency on temperature, hysteresis and relaxation. Furthermore, different equivalent circuit models are evaluated regarding their accuracy for different states of charge, temperatures and current rates. It has been found that the HPPC testing procedure is limited in characterizing high current behavior. Furthermore, it is shown that the previous long-term history has a significant impact on voltage responses at certain states of charge and current rates, which originates from an inhomogeneous distribution of charge carriers on the electrode surface. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery modeling; Electrical characterization; Electrical equivalent circuit model; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Incremental capacity analysis; Inhomogenous state of charge distribution; Lithium titanate oxide; LTO batteries; Open circuit voltage measurements","Charging (batteries); Circuit simulation; Electric discharges; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrodes; Equivalent circuits; Fuel economy; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Lead acid batteries; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Open circuit voltage; Battery modeling; Capacity analysis; Electrical characterization; Electrical equivalent circuit; Lithium titanate oxides; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077751285

Understanding climate change and long-term planning for enhanced storm and flooding hazards are imposing more stringent requirements on the robustness, precision, and accuracy of the estimates than have hitherto been needed. Taking advantage of novel retracking algorithms, particularly developed for the coastal zone, the present work aims at establishing an objective baseline processing chain for wave height retrieval that can be adapted to all satellite missions. In order to determine the best performing retracking algorithm for both Low Resolution Mode and Delay-Doppler altimetry, an objective assessment is conducted in the framework of the European Space Agency Sea State Climate Change Initiative project. All algorithms process the same Level-1 input dataset covering a time-period of up to two years. As a reference for validation, an ERA5-based hindcast wave model as well as an in-situ buoy dataset from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service In Situ Thematic Centre database are used. Five different metrics are evaluated: percentage and types of outliers, level of measurement noise, wave spectral variability, comparison against wave models, and comparison against in-situ data. The metrics are evaluated as a function of the distance to the nearest coast and the sea state. The results of the assessment show that all novel retracking algorithms perform better in the majority of the metrics than the baseline algorithms currently used for operational generation of the products. Nevertheless, the performance of the retrackers strongly differ depending on the coastal proximity and the sea state. Some retrackers show high correlations with the wave models and in-situ data but significantly under-or overestimate large-scale spectral variability. We propose a weighting scheme to select the most suitable retrackers for the Sea State Climate Change Initiative programme. © 2020 by the authors.","Altimetry; Assessment; Climate change initiative; Comparison; Delay-Doppler; ESA; LRM; Retracking; Round robin; SAR altimetry; Satellite altimetry; Significant wave height","Aneroid altimeters; Meteorological instruments; Ocean currents; Offshore oil well production; Offshore structures; Radar equipment; Radar measurement; Radio altimeters; Space-based radar; Storms; Water waves; Baseline processing; European Space Agency; Marine environment monitoring; Objective assessment; Retracking algorithms; Significant wave height; Spectral variability; Stringent requirement; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084591168

For several decades, particularly in urban areas, a shift from car-based mobility to more environmental-friendly modes has been high on political agendas. Progress has been made in many urban areas, but so far only in small, rather incremental steps. The dominance of the car has remained largely stable in urban transport. For some time now, many experts have argued that processes of digitalization will co-evolve with societal trends and lead to multimodal urban mobility regimes in which private car usage will lose its dominance. In this paper, we examine if stakeholders active in the field believe that, despite digitalization, policy interventions are essential to achieve such a transition. The analysis draws on concepts from transition research and is based on 10 semi-structured interviews with providers of innovative mobility services that may contribute to more multimodal urban mobility systems. Geographical focus is on the City of Stuttgart (Germany). Results indicate broad agreement amongst the interviewees that digitalization alone is not sufficient for achieving a full-scale transition towards multimodal urban mobility. Policy measures that restrict car-based mobility would also be needed. However, many of the interviewed actors doubt that the essential policy mixes will find the necessary political and societal acceptance. Finally, the paper indicates ways to overcome this dilemma. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Centralized wastewater treatment is typically considered the most desirable solution to meet domestic wastewater treatment needs in growing urban centers. These rely on extensive—and often expensive—infrastructure and treatment solutions that require expert engineering management to ensure effective operation. It is argued that the urban sustainability challenge of inadequate sanitation, deteriorating water quality, and rising water stress are best met through poly-centric and integrated approaches that include nature-based solutions, community-scale and community-managed systems. Today's objectives are to create climate-resilient, enduring, self-governing systems—as well as systems that close the loop, encouraging resource re-use and recycling. This policy review informs on wastewater discharge (and related) standards for sewage treatment plants within the context of present-day India. With its booming urban population, highly visible and impactful pollution, water quality and insecurity challenges, India provides huge opportunities for creative approaches to urban sanitation—but to fully exploit these opportunities will require new policy and regulatory thinking. The current regulatory developments are undergoing frequent changes with observed inconsistencies over the last years leading to a growing confusion in the sector. Examined questions include: How clear are policy objectives and regulations? What are reasons for observed inconsistencies in current pollution control regulations and what are their implications? How well-aligned are standards and regulation with these objectives? How forward-looking? Are solutions sufficiently responsive to the urban sustainability challenge? In particular, this review considers whether regulatory approaches disadvantage decentralized and innovative approaches that could offer resilient, community-based systems—even within the megacities of the twenty-first century. This study further draws on examples from other emerging economies—and contextualizes these examples with the situation in Western Europe, where a single set of targets has let to diverse solutions. Standards and regulations need to be reimagined for this evolving urban context which might require it to become more nuanced, more holistic, more dynamic, more transparent, more participative, and more contextual. Enforcement mechanisms will need to incorporate phased/graded approaches to compliance—to suit various contexts that could include water reuse for different application areas. © Copyright © 2020 Schellenberg, Subramanian, Ganeshan, Tompkins and Pradeep.","decentralized integrated management; India; nature-based; policy; regulation; reuse; sustainable sanitation; wastewater standards",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084153935

To reach climate protection goals and a significant reduction of CO2, surplus energies from fluctuating renewables have to be used to defossilize not only the power production sector but the mobility, heat and industry sectors as well, which is called sector coupling. In this article, the role of wastewater treatment plants by means of sector coupling is pictured, discussed and evaluated. The results show significant synergies-for example, using electrical surplus energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen with an electrolyzer to use them for long-term storage and enhancing purification processes on the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Furthermore, biofuels and storable methane gas can be produced or integrate the WWTP into a local heating network. An interconnection in many fields of different research sectors are given and show that a practical utilization is possible and reasonable for WWTPs to contribute with sustainable energy concepts to defossilization. © 2020 by the authors.

The characterization of the clay brick waste (CBW) was performed using the XRD techniques, XRF, FTIR, DTA and SEM. Techniques to determine the pozzolanic activity, particle size, B.E.T. surface area and specific mass were used. The consumption of calcium hydroxide (CH) in the cementitious pastes with the CBWs was also measured. An application in mortar is also analysed. The results indicated that the CH consumption was a function of the large surface area of the waste particles. The CBW reactivity is favoured by firing temperature adequate (about 800 ºC), low presence of K2O and impurities and higher kaolinite content. CBW-B showed the highest consumption of calcium hydroxide in the cement pastes tested (remaining 0.40% CH). Morphological analysis showed that microcrystals of halloysite was smaller than those of kaolinite and have more elongated profile. These differences provide the larger surface area observed for halloysite and this has an influence on the reactivity. The reference paste presented CH content of 2.37%. The compressive strength of the mortar with CBW improved comparing to reference, in 28 days (from 2.45 to 5.65 MPa), and in 90 days (from 5.72 to 10.39 MPa). The use of these wastes could reduce solid waste discards in many regions.

In order to solve this local roadside pollution problem, it is necessary to evaluate and/or predict ""where"" and ""how much"" pollutants such as NOx are emitted. To predict the local roadside pollution, it is necessary to collect emissions data from various kinds of vehicles driving on real-world and analyze them. In recent years, Real Driving Emission regulations using PEMS (Portable Emission Measurement System) have been introduced mainly in Europe. A typical PEMS configuration can weigh close to 100 kg however, and its weight affects the driving conditions of vehicles running on actual roads. In this study, we focused on the analysis of real-world emissions using SEMS (Sensor-based Emission Measurement System). Whereas PEMS is a method of sampling and analyzing exhaust gas, SEMS directly attaches a NOx sensor and PM sensor to the exhaust pipe and measures the concentration. Although SEMS has a limited number of items that can be measured compared to PEMS, other analysis is possible by devising the analysis method. This paper focuses on the analysis method of real-world emissions using SEMS and aims to examine the analysis method of CO2 emission concentration, exhaust gas flowrate, and local roadside emissions from the measured value of SEMS. In addition, an example of applying this analysis method using on-road test data of a diesel passenger car equipped with SEMS is shown. The NOx sensor can measure not only the NOx concentration but also the O2 concentration and air-fuel ratio. It is clarified that the CO2 concentration at wet condition can be calculated with high accuracy by using the measured values of the O2 concentration. Also, the exhaust flowrate is obtained by combining the intake air flow rate acquired through the vehicle's OBD and the air-fuel ratio measured by the NOx sensor. At that time, the exhaust gas density is also calculated based on the air-fuel ratio, so that the exhaust flowrate can be calculated with higher accuracy. © 2020 SAE International.

Despite increasing recognition of the critical role of mangrove ecosystems for climate change mitigation, there is limited understanding of soil organic carbon sequestration mechanisms in undisturbed low-latitude mangroves, specifically on organic carbon burial rates and sources. This study assessed soil organic carbon burial rates, sources and stocks across an undisturbed coastal mudflat and mangrove hydrogeomorphological catena (fringe mangrove and interior mangrove) in Bintuni Bay, West Papua Province, Indonesia. 210Pb radionuclide sediment dating, and mixing model of natural stable isotope signatures (δ 13C and δ15N) and C/N ratio were used to estimate organic carbon burial rates and to quantify proportions of allochthonous (i.e., upland terrestrial forest) and autochthonous (i.e., on-site mangrove forest) organic carbon in the top 50 cm of the soil. Burial rates were in the range of 0.21–1.19 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. Compared to the fringe mangroves, organic carbon burial rates in interior mangroves were almost twice as high. Primary productivity of C3 upland forest vegetation and mangroves induced soil organic carbon burial in interior mangroves and this was consistent with the formation of the largest organic carbon stocks (179 ± 82 Mg C ha−1). By contrast, organic carbon stored in the fringe mangrove (68 ± 11 Mg C ha−1) and mudflat (62 ± 10 Mg C ha−1) soils mainly originated from upland forests (allochthonous origin). These findings clearly indicate that carbon sequestered and cycling in mangrove and terrestrial forest ecosystems are closely linked, and at least a part of carbon losses (e.g., erosion) from terrestrial forests is buried in mangrove ecosystems. © 2019 The Authors","210Pb sediment dating; Blue carbon; Climate change mitigation; Soil carbon accrual; Soil carbon sequestration; Stable isotopes mixing model","carbon sequestration; climate change; forest ecosystem; mangrove; mudflat; primary production; radionuclide; soil carbon; stable isotope; Indonesia; West Papua; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076745939

In order to develop an in vitro conservation technology to obtain plants for reintroduction, seeds of Vriesea flammea L.B.Sm. were collected, sterilized and germinated in culture medium. The plants obtained were cultured for 180 days in MS medium with different concentrations of mineral nutrients (25 and 50% of nitrogenous salts and macronutrients), and different concentrations of sucrose (20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 g L-1), and then acclimatized for 150 days on commercial substrate. When seeds were sterilized directly, only 4% of them were contaminated, whereas sterilization of capsules resulted in 43.6% contaminated seeds. Germination rates above 80% were recorded. Low concentrations of nitrogenous salts and macronutrients produced greater than 76% survival and promoted greater in vitro plant development than the complete MS medium. The development of the aerial system, root system, fresh mass and photosynthetic pigments were positively related to sucrose concentration in vitro. The highest sucrose concentration also indirectly promoted greater development of the aerial system and fresh mass of acclimatized plants. We established conditions for in vitro cultivation and acclimatization for efficient propagation of V. flammea with a view towards conservation of the species or reestablishment of natural populations. © 2020, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

In this technology, a falling stream of iron ore concentrate is directly converted to metallic iron by reducing gases such as hydrogen, natural gas or coal gas in a flash furnace. In this work, the interaction of magnesia-carbon (MgO–C) refractory with ferrous oxide (FeO) under the conditions of the novel FIT has been investigated. Oxidation of carbon from the MgO–C refractory occurred and magnesiowustite (MgxFe1-xO) solid solution was formed as a result of the interaction between magnesia (MgO) in the refractory and ferrous oxide (FeO). A solid-state diffusion based kinetics model was developed to describe the growth of the magnesiowustite (MgxFe1-xO) formed. Experiments were carried out with ferrous oxide (FeO) and MgO–C refractory in the temperature range 1200–1400 °C under flash ironmaking atmospheres. Reacted samples from FeO–MgO–C experiments were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) and Electron Probe Micro-Analyzer (EPMA) and the formation of the magnesiowustite solid solution under flash ironmaking conditions was confirmed. Using the kinetics model and the composition profiles determined with EPMA, the values of interdiffusion coefficient (DFe−Mg) were determined as a function of the magnesiowustite composition. Also, an average value of the interdiffusion coefficient (D‾Fe−Mg) was calculated such that it reasonably reproduced the concentration profile of the cations over the entire composition range. The values of D‾Fe−Mg calculated in this work agreed closely with those obtained independently from experiments on the interaction between MgO–C and metallic Fe, thereby validating the interaction mechanism and the proposed kinetics model. The solid-state diffusion was a thermally activated process and the activation energy (Ea) for D‾Fe−Mg was calculated as 398 kJ/mol. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Boltzmann-matano analysis; Carbon oxidation; Flash ironmaking; Magnesia-carbon refractory; Magnesiowustite; Solid-state diffusion","Activation energy; Blast furnaces; Coal gas; Diffusion in solids; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Growth kinetics; Iron ores; Iron oxides; Kinetics; Refractory materials; Scanning electron microscopy; Solid solutions; Ternary systems; Boltzmann-Matano analysis; Carbon oxidation; Iron making; Magnesia-Carbon Refractory; Magnesiowustite; Solid-state diffusion; Magnesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076242656

C stocks in forests are decreased by logging before tree diversity is affected, while C stocks in monoculture tree plantations increase, but diversity does not. Agroforestry can break this hysteresis pattern, relevant for policies in search of synergy. We compared total C stocks and tree diversity among degraded forest, complex cacao/fruit tree agroforests, simple shade-tree cacao agroforestry, monoculture cacao, and annual crops in the Konawe District, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. We evaluated farmer tree preferences and the utility value of the system for 40 farmers (male and female). The highest tree diversity (Shannon-Wiener H index 2.36) and C stocks (282 Mg C ha-1) were found in degraded forest, followed by cacao-based agroforestry systems (H index ranged from 0.58-0.93 with C stocks of 75-89 Mg ha-1). Male farmers selected timber and fruit tree species with economic benefits as shade trees, while female farmers preferred production for household needs (fruit trees and vegetables). Carbon stocks and tree diversity were positively related (R2 = 0.72). Adding data from across Indonesia (n = 102), agroforestry systems had an intermediate position between forest decline and reforestation responses.

Adopting the Touraine-Castells sociological perspective and using an interpretive approach and a qualitative research design with in-depth interviews, this article focuses on cultural attributes that give meaning to resistance and project identities under construction. It also explores how resistance identities are linked to climate and energy policies and proposes an analytical framework to understand and to design decarbonisation pathways from resistance identities to project identities. The following conclusions are drawn from this study: a) the sources of meaning supporting current resistance identities are similar to juxtaposed, legitimising coal-phase identities (occupational, class-belonging and community identities), are reactive and founded on coal dependence, solidarity and justice; and b) resistance can only be overcome by a sustainable territorial project with a social base, which is why the adaptive dilemmas of historically coal-reliant mining communities (HCRCs) must be resolved.

The problem becomes relevant when collaboration between human resources with different skills in day-to-day operations is necessary to maintain public and commercial transport, manage various social events and emergency situations, and hence reduce congestion, injuries, emissions, etc. This study proposes a two-phase fuzzy multi-objective binary programming model for optimal allocation of five different categories of human resources to minimize the overall operational cost, maximize the allocation to accident-prone road segments, minimize the number of volunteer personnel and maximize the direct contact to reduce emissions and road traffic violations, simultaneously. A binary programming model is formulated to provide an efficient individual manpower allocation schedule for multiple road segments at different shifts. A case study is proposed for model evaluation and to derive managerial implications.

The protection of the environment and the health of the population is the highest priority of our society. For the transport companies that operate these buses, not only ecological issues but also economic issues are of great importance. Due to the high purchase costs of electric buses compared to conventional buses, operators are forced to use electric vehicles in a targeted manner in order to ensure amortization over the service life of the vehicles. A compromise between ecology and economy must be found in order to both protect the environment and ensure economical operation of the buses. In this study, we present a new methodology for optimizing the vehicles’ charging time as a function of the parameters CO2eq emissions and electricity costs. Based on recorded driving profiles in daily bus operation, the energy demands of conventional and electric buses are calculated for the passenger transportation in the city of Aachen in 2017. Different charging scenarios are defined to analyze the influence of the temporal variability of CO2eq intensity and electricity price on the environmental impact and economy of the bus. For every individual day of a year, charging periods with the lowest and highest costs and emissions are identified and recommendations for daily bus operation are made. To enable both the ecological and economical operation of the bus, the parameters of electricity price and CO2 are weighted differently, and several charging periods are proposed, taking into account the priorities previously set. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the influence of selected parameters and to derive recommendations for improving the ecological and economic balance of the battery-powered electric vehicle. In all scenarios, the optimization of the charging period results in energy cost savings of a maximum of 13.6% compared to charging at a fixed electricity price. The savings potential of CO2eq emissions is similar, at 14.9%. From an economic point of view, charging between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. results in the lowest energy costs on average. The CO2eq intensity is also low in this period, but midday charging leads to the largest savings in CO2eq emissions. From a life cycle perspective, the electric bus is not economically competitive with the conventional bus. However, from an ecological point of view, the electric bus saves on average 37.5% CO2eq emissions over its service life compared to the diesel bus. The reduction potential is maximized if the electric vehicle exclusively consumes electricity from solar and wind power. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery electric vehicle; Charging strategy; CO2 emissions; Electricity price","Air quality; Artificial life; Battery electric vehicles; Bus transportation; Carbon dioxide; Charging time; Depreciation; Diesel engines; Electric automobiles; Environmental protection; Sensitivity analysis; Wind power; Battery-powered electric vehicles; Charging strategies; CO2 emissions; Ecological and economic; Electricity prices; Life cycle perspectives; Passenger transportation; Protection of the environments; Costs; bus transport; carbon emission; ecological approach; economic analysis; electric vehicle; energy use; environmental economics; optimization; price dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080919907

Although tDCS holds great potential, it is difficult to determine optimal treatment procedures to accommodate configurations, the complex shapes, and dramatic conductivity differences among various tissues. Furthermore, recent demonstrations showed that up to 75% of the tDCS current applied to rodents and human cadavers was shunted by the scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle, bringing the effects of tDCS on the cortex into question. Consequently, it is essential to combine tDCS with human neuroimaging to complement animal and cadaver studies and clarify if and how tDCS can affect neural function. One viable approach is positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. PET has unique potential for examining the effects of tDCS within the central nervous system in vivo, including cerebral metabolism, neuroreceptor occupancy, and neurotransmitter activity/binding.

Forests are the largest terrestrial ecosystem and play an important role in carbon sequestration. Many studies have documented that a mixed-species forest can sequester more carbon than single species forests, depending on the site conditions. Therefore, uneven-aged mixed-species forest management has been receiving more and more attention. In 2008, an experiment with five silvicultural models for Pinus massoniana (Chinese red pine) plantation, i.e., four transformation treatments (A1-A4) and one control treatment (A5) was conducted in the Experimental Center of Tropical Forestry of Chinese Academy of Forestry in Pingxiang City, in southwestern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, southern China. The four transformation treatments (A1-A4) enriched Castanopsis hystrix, Manglietia glance, Erythrophleum fordii and Quercus griffithii with differed richness and composition after thinning (removed 70% of trees), while no silvicultural treatment was used in the control treatment A5. In this study, we compared the carbon sequestration capacity of these five silvicultural models based on periodic annual increment and growth rate. Our results indicated that all the transformation treatments performed significantly better in carbon sequestration than the control treatment. A significant difference was also observed amongst the transformation treatments. Moreover, the transformation treatment A1 with enrichment species Castanopsis hystrix (350 trees·ha−1) and Manglietia glance (350 trees·ha−1) was determined to be the optimal model for maximum carbon sequestration because of its high tree-level growth rate and high economic value of enriched plantings, which could be popularized in other places. Our results further confirmed that management using mixed-species forests is a better approach to combat climate change than using monoculture forests. © 2020, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon sequestration; lobal warming; Mixed-species forest; Silvicultural model; Singlespecies (monoculture) forest","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; evergreen tree; mixed forest; monoculture; plantation; species richness; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Pingxiang [Guangxi Zhuangzu]; Castanopsis hystrix; Erythrophleum fordii; Manglietia; Pinus massoniana; Quercus griffithii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083114174

The impacts of climate and cultivated land change on the CWR were quantified, and the associated impacts of the CWR on the water resources and environment were discussed. The results revealed that the mean unit area CWR of the SDB was 944.1 mm and the rate of increase was 7.6 mm/a from 2000 to 2018. The area of the primary crops expanded by 5851.6 km2, and the total CWR increased at a mean rate of 2.0 × 108 m3/a, with the majority of this change being concentrated between 2010 and 2018. By 2018, the total CWR reached 194.8 × 108 m3. The lower reaches of the SDB were associated with a high CWR and a high rate of increase. Along with the reduction in basin water resources, the increased CWR has exacerbated the water stress in the SDB. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the dominant factors influencing the change in the CWR are cultivated land change (65.0%) and climate change (35.0%). Owing to a reasonable crop planting structure, the middle reaches maintained a relatively low CWR and rate of increase. Given the predicted changes in climate, optimizing crop planting structure and controlling the expansion of cultivated land in order to reduce the CWR can help to mitigate water scarcity. © 2020","Arid transboundary rivers; Central Asia; Climate and cultivated land change; Crop water requirement; Syr Darya Basin","Crops; Land use; Rivers; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Water management; Central Asia; Crop water requirements; Cultivated lands; Syr Darya Basin; Trans-boundary rivers; Climate change; arid environment; climate change; land use change; river basin; river water; spatiotemporal analysis; water resource; water stress; water use; agricultural parameters; alfalfa; Article; Asia; Central Asia; climate change; controlled study; crop planting structure; crop water requirement; cultivated land; fallow; Gossypium; land use; maize; meteorological phenomena; orchard; prediction; priority journal; rice; river; river basin; spatiotemporal analysis; sunflower; vegetable; water stress; water supply; wheat; Central Asia; Syr Darya Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077926420

At the same time, it is recognized that renewable power represents only one element of the portfolio of technologies that will be required to deliver a technically feasible and financially viable energy system. In this context, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is understood to play a uniquely important role, providing significant value through flexible operation. It is therefore of vital importance that CCS technology can operate synergistically with intermittent renewable power sources, and consequently ensuring that CCS does not inhibit the flexible and dispatchable nature of thermal power plants. This work analyses the intrinsic dynamic performance of the power and CO2 capture plants independently and as an integrated system. Since the power plant represents the fast dynamics of the system and the steam extraction is the main point of integration between the CO2 capture and power plants, disturbances with fast dynamics are imposed on the steam extraction valve during steady state and dynamic operation of a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) to study the effects of the integration on power generation capacity. The results demonstrate that the integration of liquid-absorbent based post-combustion CO2 capture has negligible impact on the power generation dynamics of the NGCC. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Amine absorption process; Combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT); Dynamic modelling; Dynamic operation; Flexible operation; Monoethanolamine (MEA); Post-combustion CO2 capture","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Combustion; Dynamic models; Dynamics; Ethanolamines; Extraction; Gas plants; Natural gasoline plants; Solar energy; Steam power plants; Thermoelectric power plants; Absorption process; CO2 capture; Combined cycle gas turbine; Dynamic operations; Flexible operation; Monoethanolamine; Combined cycle power plants; absorption; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; combustion; dynamic analysis; modeling; power generation; power plant; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079843273

However, combustion phasing control and the limited operating range in ACI mode are a perennial challenge. In this study the combined impact of fuel properties and engine control strategies in ACI operation are investigated. A design of experiments method was implemented using a three level orthogonal array to determine the sensitivity of engine control parameters on the engine load, combustion noise and stability under low load ACI operation for three RON 98 gasoline fuels, each exhibiting disparate chemical composition. Furthermore, the thermodynamic state of the compression histories was studied with the aid of the pressure-temperature framework. Due to the compression ratio constraints imposed by knock limited SI operation, considerable intake temperature heating was required and ACI operation resulted in the intermediate to high temperature autoignition regime. The olefin containing fuel was found to be most sensitive to intake air heating, thereby enhancing its potential suitability for ACI operation, while still enabling high load SI operation. © 2020 Argonne National Laboratory, operated by UChicago Argonne, LLC, for the U.S. Department of Energy.",,"Air intakes; Chemical stability; Combustion; Design of experiments; Engines; Gasoline; Temperature; Analytical approach; Chemical compositions; Compression ignition; Engine control parameters; Engine control strategy; Gasoline direct injection engines; Part load conditions; Thermodynamic state; Direct injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083828985

Promoting green roofs is thus a key element in urban strategies to address climate change. How to actually promote green roofs, however, has so far proven elusive: attempts to link specific policy instruments to a more or less successful diffusion of green roofs have been few and far between. The present paper relies on institutional economics to advance the present understanding of the link between policy instruments and green roofs. It argues that different green roofs are confronted with different social dilemmas, and thus require different policy instruments. Specifically, small green roofs face a free-rider problem, which is best addressed through regulations and incentives. Large green roofs face instead a collective action problem, which is best addressed through communications and network-building. This perspective is tested empirically through a comparative analysis of 18 global cities on the forefront in the promotion of green roofs. The policy instruments observed in these cities match with the theoretical expectations laid down in the paper.

In this paper, we propose a methodology to address a retrofit planning problem at a community level, with a building resolution. The resulting tool helps local decision-makers identify pertinent actions to improve the environmental behavior of their territories. Two building retrofit levers are considered, namely envelope insulation and heating systems replacement. Retrofit planning is treated here as a single-objective optimization problem aimed at reducing the total costs of retrofit actions by minimizing their net present value. A multidimensional multiple-choice knapsack problem formulation is proposed through the adoption of adequate decision variables. It suitably balances the complexity induced by the large number of potential retrofit action combinations and the number of variables in the problem and permits a linear formulation. An optimization of virtual building stocks is performed to highlight the developed model's capacity to tackle large problems (5,000 buildings) in a few minutes. Finally, three analyses finally are led on a real case-study territory, featuring both appropriate retrofit solutions and building stock information. Long-term evaluation of retrofit strategies over the short-term results in an additional 10% reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gases emissions and encourages thermal insulation. When targeting a 40% reduction in energy demand, retrofit costs ranging from 20 to 800€/m2 are observed. Finally, the developed method was used to draw a CO2 abatement cost curve at territory level. A 70% reduction of emissions can be achieved with costs under 50 €/tCO2e. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cost optimization; Energy savings; Knapsack problem; Linear integer programming; Retrofit; Territory scale","Buildings; Climate change; Combinatorial optimization; Cost reduction; Decision making; Decision support systems; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Heating equipment; Integer programming; Retrofitting; Sustainable development; Thermal insulation; Cost optimization; Knapsack problems; Linear integer programming; Retrofit; Territory scale; Energy conservation; abatement cost; decision making; energy planning; environmental economics; global climate; heating; optimization; residential energy; territorial reunification; territoriality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079841710

How to reach those targets, however, requires balancing physical realities of the natural environment with the complexity of the human social environment, including histories, cultures, and values. Archaeology is the study of interactions of natural and social environments through time and across space. As well, the field of cultural resources management, which includes archaeology, regularly engages with values such as site significance and allocation of funding that the modern social environment ascribes to its own history. Through these two approaches, archaeology has potential to provide both data for and methods of addressing challenges the global community faces through climate change. To date, however, archaeology and related areas of cultural heritage have had relatively little role in the global climate response. Here, we assess the social environment of archaeology and climate change and resulting structural barriers that have limited use of archaeology in and for climate change with a case study of the US federal government. On this basis, we provide recommendations to the fields of archaeology and climate response about how to more fully realize the multiple potential uses of archaeology for the challenges of climate change. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

The addition of a small quantity of La3+ converted some Ce3+ into Ce4+, narrowed the “effective band-gap” by 0.2 eV, and created a singly ionized oxygen vacancy species, thus changing the total electrical resistance and creating its dual behavior. The exposure to a reducing atmosphere such as carbon monoxide resulted in a significant increase in defects and converted some Ce4+ into Ce3+ and vice-versa with oxygen atmosphere exposure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon monoxide; Cerium oxide; Defects; Lanthanum; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","Carbon monoxide; Defects; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Energy gap; Fluorspar; Lanthanum; Lanthanum compounds; Oxides; Oxygen; Paramagnetic resonance; Paramagnetism; Photoelectrons; Photons; Spectroscopic analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Crystalline structure; Electrical resistances; Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy; Lanthanum doped cerium oxide; Paramagnetic defects; Singly ionized oxygen; Spectroscopic studies; Surface concentration; Cerium oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078217880

Two embedded, entwined, and exceptional American institutions - broad private property rights and competitive federalism - are necessary for explaining this shift. These two institutions shaped the exceptional stringency of 1970s American environmental laws and the powerful backlash against these laws that continues today. American colonies ensured broad private rights to use land and natural resources for profit. The colonies and the independent state governments that followed wielded expansive authority to govern this commodified environment. In the 1780s, Congress underwrote state governance of the privatized environment by directing the parceling and transfer of federal land to private parties and of environmental governance to future states. The 1787 Constitution cemented these relationships and exposed states to interstate economic competition. Environmental laws of the 1970s imposed unprecedented challenges to the environmental prerogatives long protected by these institutions, and the beneficiaries responded with a wide-ranging counterattack. Federalism enabled this opposition to build powerful regional alliances to stymie action on climate change. These overlooked institutional factors are necessary to explain why Canadian and American environmental policies have diverged. Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

The extra-ordinary logistical and financial complications in acquiring fuel often result in energy poverty. To alleviate these realities, and simultaneously mitigate noise and emissions, communities are focused on harnessing local renewable resources to achieve aggressive decarbonization and renewable energy penetration. This study quantifies the diesel and emissions mitigation potential of micro-hydro, solar and wave energy; and defines ‘allowable-cost’ Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) targets. Through the application of a bottom-up, time domain energy systems model, Remote Community Optimization Model (RCOM), differing renewable options (including wave, micro-hydro and solar) are compared. The RCOM model formulates the community's energy system operation as a cost minimization optimization problem and generates an hourly dispatch strategy. Comparing hybrid renewables-based systems to the diesel only case, the maximum allowable LCOE values for each renewable energy system to provide economic benefit to the local community are quantified. Additional sensitivities to resource availability, emissions pricing and fuel costs are explored through scenario-based sensitivity analyses. Utilizing RCOM for Hot Springs Cove (remote Canadian community), the diesel system results in LCOE of $0.76/kWh. The development of a small hydro system (225 kW) reduces the community's fuel costs by ~$5.2 M over the 30-yr. project lifetime. However, these savings are less than the upfront construction capital, and the associated LCOE increases to $1.36/kWh. Based on the novel ‘allowable-cost’ analysis, wave energy was found to provide economic benefit if the supplied power could be delivered for less than $0.59/kWh; with the added benefit of reducing diesel consumption by 40%, and returning $23,206/kW installed. Comparatively, integrating solar had an allowable-cost LCOE of $0.53/kWh, reduced diesel consumption by only 12%, and gave a return of $6844/kW installed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Hydroelectric power; Levelized cost of energy (LCOE); Micro-grid; Remote communities; Solar photovoltaic; Wave energy","Cost reduction; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Electric load dispatching; Fuels; Hot springs; Hydroelectric power; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Time domain analysis; Wave energy conversion; Levelized costs; Micro grid; Remote communities; Solar photovoltaics; Wave energy; Cost benefit analysis; alternative energy; economic conditions; electricity; energy resource; hydroelectric power; integrated approach; optimization; photovoltaic system; rural population; solar power; wave energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079871485

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has had a problem with water scarcity. The main factors affecting water security are unequal water distribution, wrong use of water resources and using bad or less efficient irrigation techniques. This paper is aimed to provide a detailed feasibility and techno-economic evaluation of using several scenarios of a stand-alone hybrid renewable energy system to satisfy the electrical energy needs for an environmentally friendly seawater desalination plant which feeds 150 m-3 day-1 of freshwater to 1000 people in NEOM City, Saudi Arabia. The first scenario is based on hybrid solar photovoltaic PV, fuel cells (FC) with a hydrogen storage system and batteries system (BS), while the second and third scenarios are based on hybrid PV/BS and PV/FC with a hydrogen storage system, respectively. HOMER® software was used to obtain the optimal configuration based on techno-economic analysis of each component of the hybrid renewable energy systems and an economic and environmental point of view based on the values of net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE). Based on the obtained results, the best configuration is PV/FC/BS. The optimal size and related costs for the optimal size are 235 kW PV array, 30 kW FC, 144 batteries, 30 kW converter, 130 kW electrolyzer, and 25 kg hydrogen tank is considered the best option for powering a 150 m3 reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant. The values of net present cost (NPC) and the cost of energy (COE) are $438,657 and $0.117/kWh, respectively. From the authors' point view, the proposed system is one among the foremost environmentally friendly systems to provide electric energy to the seawater desalination plant, especially when connecting to the utility grid, because it is ready to reduce a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions due to using oil/nature gas in utility generation stations to reduce the effect of global warming. © 2020 by the authors.","Environmentally-friendly; Hybrid PV/FC/BS; Hydrogen storage system; Saudi NEOM City; Seawater desalination plant",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086627536

However, these models mostly focus on abiotic soil processes and, despite its recognized critical mechanistic role, do not explicitly include interacting soil organisms. Here, we use a literature study to show that even a relatively simple soil community (heathland soils) contains large uncertainties in temporal and spatial food web structure. Next, we used a Lotka–Volterra-based food web model to demonstrate that, due to these uncertainties, climate change can either increase or decrease soil carbon sequestration to varying extents. Both the strength and direction of changes strongly depend on (1) the main consumer’s (enchytraeid worms) feeding preferences and (2) whether decomposers (fungi) or enchytraeid worms are more sensitive to stress. Hence, even for a soil community with a few dominant functional groups and a simulation model with a few parameters, filling these knowledge gaps is a critical first step towards the explicit integration of soil food web dynamics into carbon cycling models in order to better assess the role soils play in climate change mitigation. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Food web; Heathlands; Modelling; Soil carbon sequestration; Stress","biological model; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; chemistry; climate change; ecosystem; food chain; microbiology; soil; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Food Chain; Models, Biological; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074576977

The extent to which a community is able to utilize all its resources depends on the extent to which it feels empowered to take action and is a major determinant of its resilience. A narrative of community empowerment has recently emerged from Scottish Government, driven in part by the situation in Scotland, in which a skewed pattern of landownership and distant structure of 'local' democracy combine to disempower communities by disconnecting them from local resources and local representative democracy. Recent Scottish legislation appears to provide new opportunities for community groups to gain control of local assets, become more financially sustainable, undertake climate-related mitigation actions and overcome some of the current local democratic deficit. At the same time, an increasingly well-organized and networked community sector and some within the Scottish Government are actively exploring new ways to enable public participation and deliver public services. This paper analyses the current Scottish policy framework and aspirations for community empowerment and, through interviews with stakeholders, assesses the potential, this may provide for communities to become truly resilient and to actively engage with transformational change. © 2018 Oxford University Press and Community Development Journal. 2018 All rights reserved.

The political leaderships' prioritization of sociopolitical and economic development, combined with the wish for a closer integration into the world market, shifted the countries' governance structures and agenda setting. Undertaken economic projects, including oil explorations, mining and gold extractions, flower farming and intense rice growing, put conservation areas at great risk and led to a decrease of the country's wetland and forest cover. Accordingly, the impact of climate change on the vulnerability of countries is increasing. The paper critically investigates how particularly recent economic investments by national and international companies question the coherence between the institutional framework on climate policies, especially on a sub-national level of decision-making. Based on two field visits to the area, this paper raises the question of how the institutional frameworks shape climate governance processes in Kenya and Uganda. Looking at both political and climate governance structures from a pragmatic perspective, this paper concludes that the insufficient implementation of existing governance structures hampers the better integration of climate policies. National actors do not consider climate financing as an important issue which results in the fragmentation and undermining of climate policy processes. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change adaptability; Economic upgrading; Resource governance","adaptive management; agricultural intensification; climate change; environmental policy; governance approach; institutional framework; mining; nature-society relations; political discourse; prioritization; state role; Kenya; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083662252

However, only a few kinds of nanoparticles can generate sufficient strong PS-LIBS signals for single-shot two-dimensional measurement. In this work, we report on the development and validation of a resonance-enhanced PS-LIBS for instantaneous two-dimensional imaging of nanoparticle formation and transport in a turbulent reactive flow. By matching the laser pulse with the absorption line of titanium atoms in the laser-induced nanoplasma, we find that the resonance-enhanced titanium atomic emissions are 1 order of magnitude stronger than the nonresonant spectra ranging from 498 to 502 nm. Based on the spectral characterization, a quantitative relation between the spectra and the particle volume fraction is theoretically established and validated by experiments. Combining the resonance-enhanced PS-LIBS and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) techniques, instantaneous two-dimensional distributions of the nanoparticle and the hydroxyl radical (OH radical) can be measured in situ in a turbulent reactive flow.

In 2016, the Chinese government required existing coal fleets to conduct flexibility retrofits to accommodate more renewable power. We conduct this study to evaluate how coal power retrofits could affect wind integration and emissions at a system level. By constructing a balancing model that respects China’s unique quota-based dispatch rules, we use real data from provincial dispatch center of Jilin Province to compare wind power integration and system emissions before and after coal power retrofits. We find that coal power retrofits can significantly reduce wind curtailment from 31 to 7% in our base simulation model. However, emission reductions achieved from coal power retrofits are subject to diminishing marginal returns. We suggest policy efforts to proceed with the strategy of coal power retrofits but carefully evaluate both economic and environmental costs associated with different technologies to reduce pollution and implement from the least expensive ones. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Coal power retrofits; Emission reduction; Grid flexibility; Wind integration","alternative energy; coal-fired power plant; cost analysis; emission control; environmental technology; government; simulation; wind power; China; Jilin; coal; air pollution; China; electric power plant; pollution; wind; Air Pollution; China; Coal; Environmental Pollution; Power Plants; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078190957

The United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda includes a goal to reduce FLW by 50% by 2030. Given differences in resource inputs along the food supply chain (FSC), the environmental benefits of FLW reduction will vary by stage of the FSC. Here, we identify the points along the supply chain where a 50% FLW reduction could yield the largest potential environmental benefits, assuming that decreases in consumption propagate back up the supply chain to reduce production. We use an environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) model combined with data on rates of FLW to calculate the scale of the total environmental impacts of the U.S. food system resulting from lost or wasted food. We evaluate the maximum potential environmental benefit resulting from 50% FLW reduction at all possible combinations of six supply chain stages (agricultural production, food processing, distribution/retail, restaurant foodservice, institutional foodservice, and households). We find that FLW reduction efforts should target the foodservice (restaurant) sector, food processing sector, and household consumption. Halving FLW in the foodservice sector has the highest potential to reduce greenhouse gas output and energy use. Halving FLW in the food processing sector could reduce the most land use and eutrophication potential, and reducing household consumption waste could avert the most water consumption. In contrast, FLW reduction at the retail, institutional foodservice, and farm level averts less environmental impact. Our findings may help determine optimal investment in FLW reduction strategies. © 2019","Environmentally extended input-output model (EEIO); Food loss and waste (FLW); Food supply chain (FSC)","Agriculture; Eutrophication; Food processing; Food supply; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Land use; Processed foods; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Agricultural productions; Environmental benefits; Eutrophication potentials; Food loss; Household Consumption; Input output model; Optimal investments; Reduction strategy; Environmental impact; environmental impact; food consumption; food market; food supply; food waste; investment; numerical model; sustainable development; United Nations; article; eutrophication; fluid intake; food processing; greenhouse gas; household; investment; land use; restaurant; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077756448

The objective of the research is to determine the carbon stocks in the three agroforestry practices. These are Multilayer Tree Garden (MTG), Taungya (TGY), and Home Garden (HMG). The research was carried out from May 2017 to November 2017 at Sragen and Karanganyar Regency, Central Java. A plot size of 20 m x 100 m for big trees, 5 m x 40 m for small trees, and 1 m x 1 m for understory vegetation was used in the sampling. The carbon stock was measured by Chave's allometric equation. The carbon stock in the multilayer tree garden is the highest (44.47 Mg C/ha) compared with the taungya (38.81 Mg C/ha) and home garden (31.41 Mg C/ha). Meanwhile, the above-ground carbon stock in the home garden practice is the biggest (14.97 Mg C/ha or 48 %) among the multilayer tree garden (9.67 Mg C/ha or 23%) and taungya (6.11 Mg C/ha or 16%).

However, the price tag on coal has never reflected the external cost to society; coal combustion produces more than a third of today’s global CO2 emissions and is a major contributor to local adverse effects on the environment and public health, such as biodiversity loss and respiratory diseases. Here, we show that phasing out coal yields substantial local environmental and health benefits that outweigh the direct policy costs due to shortening of the energy supply. Phasing out coal is thus a no-regret strategy for most world regions, even when only accounting for domestic effects and neglecting the global benefits from slowing climate change. Our results suggest that these domestic effects potentially eliminate much of the free-rider problem caused by the discrepancy between the national burden of decarbonization costs and the internationally shared benefits of climate change impact mitigation. This, combined with the profound effect of closing around half of the global CO2 emissions gap towards the 2 °C target, makes coal phase-out policies attractive candidates for the iterative strengthening of the nationally determined contributions pledged by the countries under the Paris Agreement. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon emission; climate change; coal combustion; cost analysis; economic impact; environmental change; environmental economics; Asia; Europe; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083372885

In part 1, the steady state experimental investigation in a single cylinder GCI engine indicate an optimum strategy for effective catalyst light off during cold start fast idle operation. According to this strategy, the strategy includes (1) dispersing a first fuel injection during the intake stroke, (2) dispersing a second fuel injection during the expansion stroke, and (3) igniting a spark during the expansion stroke. This strategy increases the exhaust temperature during cold starts thereby assisting in lighting the oxidation catalyst, and reduce emissions and provide greater combustion stability as compared to other injection and spark strategies. In this study, based on the reported optimum strategy, a strategic sensitivity study was performed to investigate the impact of lambda, load, speed, spark plug design and injector spray pattern on effective cold start catalyst light off. The strategy, hereby specifically termed as tailed injection strategy, is as follows: 1) start of first injection (SOI1st) =-350 CAD aTDC 2) start of second injection (SOI2nd) = 15 CAD aTDC and 3) spark timing = 15 CAD aTDC. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that higher load is useful to obtain better combustion stability and higher exhaust temperature at expense of increased fuel consumption and emission. At higher speeds, increased exhaust temperature is attained but with the penalty of increased NOX emission and higher COV. Lean operation (Lambda = 1.05) has a better compromise in terms of COV and emissions. In order to ascertain the feasibility of the proposed strategy during fast idle period, dynamic testing with fast (transient) HC measurement was performed in part 2 of the study besides performing the steady state sensitivity study. Dynamic operation at the optimum strategy resulted in few initial misfired cycles due to poor combustion stability (for less than 4 secs after). This was identified by the initial HC spike in the time resolved fast HC measurement profile. Therefore, either the engine was run richer or the spark timing was advanced during the first part of fast idle catalyst warm up period to reduce the misfiring and minimize hydrocarbon and CO breakthrough. Amongst these two operating strategies, spark timing advancement during the first phase of idle period is effective during dynamic operation as running richer cost for increase HC cumulative emissions in the tail pipe. Based on the dynamic testing results, we split the initially proposed control strategy in two parts-firstly, transient combustion control strategy during first part of fast idle phase (less than 4 secs) for rapid engine warm up and effective catalyst light off (light off phase 1) secondly, split fuel injection and extremely retarded spark timing strategy is proposed during the second part of catalyst warm up period to generate high enthalpy flow in the exhaust with reduced hydrocarbon and other emissions, improved combustion stability, and fuel economy (light off phase 2). © 2020 SAE International.

The engine cold start fast idle operation poses a problem of increased criteria emissions if the catalyst is not activated during the warm up period. Therefore, a control strategy is proposed here to minimize the criteria pollutants during the fast idle phase via enabling fast catalyst light off in a GCI engine and relying on the spark ignition of a globally stoichiometric fuel air mixture. The engine has unique design features such as certain geometry configuration between spark plug and fuel injector arrangement, and the location of spark plug in a high compression ratio (CR) diesel-like combustion chamber. The experiments were performed in a single cylinder GCI engine at cold start fast idle conditions using certification gasoline fuel (RON 91). Split fuel injection and extremely retarded spark timing strategy are applied to generate high enthalpy flow in the exhaust pipe with reduced hydrocarbon and other emissions, improved combustion stability, and fuel economy. Based on the experimentation, split injection cases namely 1) tailed injection case-SOI1st =-350 CAD aTDC and SOI2nd = 15 CAD aTDC, 2) intake injection case-SOI1st =-350 CAD aTDC and SOI2nd =-270 CAD aTDC, showed better results in terms of COV and criteria emissions when compared to other fuel injection cases. The steady state experimental results also indicate that, regardless of fuel injection strategy, retarded spark timing of 15 CAD aTDC is required to attain a higher exhaust temperature of around 700°C to 800 °C. In summary, evaluation of cold start performance index identifies tailed injection strategy as optimum to generate higher exhaust energy without compromising the combustion stability to effectively light off the catalyst and reduce the criteria emissions. © 2020 SAE International.

Based on systematic investigations of the steady state photo-isomerization and transient behavior of the reaction, we comprehended that the phenomena is caused by trapping of excess energy liberated during the isomerization, as well as the relaxation processes upon excitation of azobenzene chromophores in the interlayers of the hybrid. In this paper, quantitative estimation of transient 'heat' trapped in various microenvironments has been studied by each co-intercalation of temperature sensing dye molecules-rhodamine B (RhB) or tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(ii) chloride (Rubpy) with C3F-Azo-C6H within clay (SSA) nano-layers. The amount of dye molecules co-intercalated was kept to trace amounts that did not alter the bi-layered structure of the hybrid. The temperature of the microenvironment surrounding the probe molecules was estimated from the emission lifetime analysis. The evidently reduced emission lifetimes in C3F-Azo-C6H/SSA and C3H-Azo-C6H/SSA hybrids in the film state, indicated the elevation of temperature of the microenvironment upon excitation of the chromophores, which demonstrated our previous hypothesis rationalizing that the high reactivity of isomerization in the hybrid film state is caused by heat trapping via multi-step dissipation of the excess energy. With the hybrid of a hydrocarbon analogue (C3H-Azo-C6H), a distinct difference in temperature gradient was found to show the crucial role of the perfluoroalkyl chain of the surfactant that traps the excess energy to retard its dissipation leading to three-dimensional morphological motion.

In the present investigation, sequences of narrow band red emitting phosphors were synthesized via the conventional solid-state technique. The X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the as-synthesized phosphors were crystallized in the trigonal phase with the space group I41/a (88). Under 395 nm excitation, NaSrGd(MoO4)3:Eu3+ phosphors showed sharp red emission at about 616 nm because of the 5D0 → 7F2 transition (ED transition). Moreover, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was found to be 82%, and the thermal stability study showed that the NaSrGd0.5Eu0.5(MoO4)3 phosphor retains the emission intensity of about 71.5% of its initial room temperature intensity at 423 K. The red LEDs were designed for the NaSrGd0.5Eu0.5(MoO4)3 red phosphors with the NUV LED chip. White LED was also fabricated by conjugating the blue LED with yellow dye + red phosphor and the LED showed CCT (6823 K), CRI (74%), and CIE (0.306, 0.331). The Sm3+ and Eu3+ co-doped deep red phosphor was synthesized and studied in plant growth. The LED emission of Sm3+ and Eu3+ co-doped phosphor completely covers the absorption spectrum of Phytochrome Pr. All of these consequences revealed that the as-synthesized phosphor could be an efficient red emitting phosphor for warm white LEDs with application in plant growth research.

It is, therefore necessary to understand leaf litter traits in response to increased atmospheric CO2. Variations in plant litter chemistry under elevated carbon dioxide (e−CO2) are the critical factors in ecosystem feedback. Litter fall, litter substrate quality, nutrient flux and decay rate in two tropical tree of Tectona grandis (Teak) and Butea monosperma (Butea) were examined. Saplings were exposed to elevated CO2 treatment (e−CO2 -550 ppm) and ambient CO2 (a−CO2; - 395 ppm) in the FACE (Free air CO2 enrichment) facility in CSIR- National Botanical Research Institute in Indo-Gangetic plain region. Litter was analysed for concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), soluble sugars (SS), lipids, lignin, cellulose, hemi-cellulose (HC) and C-based defensive compounds; soluble phenolics (SP). Nutrient concentration in naturally senesced litter for Butea and Teak was significantly different in elevated and ambient rings. Elevated CO2 significantly increased C/N (+8.27 % and +21.94 %), lowered mean litter N concentration (–3.27 % and -12.15 %), and affected the concentrations of soluble sugars, soluble phenolic and lipids in leaf litter of Butea and Teak plantations, respectively. Increase in litter biomass production (+19.75 % and 22.84 %) for both the plants under e−CO2, resulted in significant increase in the flux of N, SS, SP and lipid in to the soil. Elevated CO2 increased cellulose (+18.21 %; 12.30 %), hemicellulose (+8.48 %; +10.18 %) and lignin inputs to soils (+35.22; +43.36 %) in Butea and Teak plantation respectively. The study indicated that changes in litter biomass production and litter substrate quality during exposure to e−CO2 could significantly alter the input of nitrogen, soluble phenolic, soluble sugars, lipids, cellulose, and lignin to soils, and so also the biogeochemical cycle of the prevailing ecosystem. © 2020","Butea; Cellulose; Elevated CO2; Face; Lignin; Litter; Phenol; Teak; Tropical forest","biochemical composition; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; cellulose; deciduous tree; functional role; leaf litter; lipid; nutrient cycling; phenolic compound; plantation forestry; research institution; subtropical region; Gangetic Plain; PLN Plain; Butea; Butea monosperma; Tectona grandis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078669661

This area covers the territory of most Italian northern regions and includes several urban agglomerates, such as Milan, Turin, Venice and Bologna. The area is densely populated and heavily industrialized. The paper summarizes the assessment of the impact of the current (2013) and future (2025) emissions and of the meteorological conditions on the air quality of the Po Valley. This study is one of the first outcomes of the EU LIFE-IP Clean Air Program Po Regions Engaged to Policies of Air (PREPAIR) project. The project, involving administrations and environmental agencies of eight regions and three municipalities in Northern Italy and Slovenia, started in 2017 and will end in 2024. Future emission scenarios consider the emissions reduction due to the air-quality action plans of the regions involved, of the agreements between the national authorities and regional administrations and of the PREPAIR project itself, in the overall context of the application of the current legislation of the European Union. The combination of these measures will lead to the reduction of direct emissions of PM10 in the Po Valley and of the main precursors emitted in the area (NOx, nitrogen oxides and NH3, and ammonia) by 38% for PM10, 39% for NOx and 22% for NH3, respectively. This lowering corresponds to a reduction of about 30.000 tons of primary PM10, 150.000 tons of NOx, 54.000 tons of NH3 and 1700 tons of SO2. The results show that these expected reductions should allow us to achieve the EU PM10 limit value in the Po Valley by the year 2025. © 2020 by the authors.","Air-quality action plan; Air-quality model; Po valley; Reduction emission scenario","Air quality; Ammonia; Emission control; Laws and legislation; Nitrogen oxides; Emission scenario; Emissions reduction; Environmental agency; Meteorological condition; Nitrogen dioxides; Particulate Matter; Po Valley , Italy; Quality action plans; Landforms; air quality; ammonia; emission inventory; European Union; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; pollution control; urban area; Bologna [Bologna (ADS)]; Bologna [Emilia-Romagna]; Emilia-Romagna; Italy; Lombardy; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]; Piedmont [Italy]; Po Valley; Torino [Piedmont]; Turin; Veneto; Venezia [Veneto]; Venice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084539920

In this study, by using a numerical modelling approach, the impact of AV on the air quality of a medium-sized Portuguese urban area was evaluated. For that, the air pollutants nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were considered and three scenarios were developed: i) a baseline scenario; ii) an autonomous scenario, assuming an AV market penetration rate of 30%; and iii) an electric autonomous scenario, taking into account that those 30% of AV are pure battery electric cars. A modelling system composed by a road traffic model, a road transport emission model and a Computational Fluid Dynamics air quality model was used. The autonomous scenario promoted an increase of both NOx (+1.8%) and CO2 (+0.7%) emissions, while the electric autonomous scenario resulted in emission reductions of about 30% for both air pollutants. In terms of air quality, distinct patterns were found: i) the autonomous scenario promoted both increases and decreases of NOx concentrations; and ii) the electric autonomous scenario promoted a widespread reduction of NOx concentrations (with an average value of −4%). Overall the results showed that AV have the potential to improve urban air quality, but, further research is needed to enrich the findings of this work. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Autonomous vehicles; Numerical modelling; Road transport emissions; Urban areas","Air; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Computational fluid dynamics; Emission control; Motor transportation; Nitrogen oxides; Numerical models; Roads and streets; Transport properties; Urban transportation; Air quality impacts; Air quality modeling; Atmospheric emission; Emission reduction; Market penetration; Modelling systems; Road transport emissions; Urban areas; Autonomous vehicles; carbon dioxide; nitrogen oxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; nitrogen oxides; numerical model; road transport; traffic emission; unmanned vehicle; urban area; acceleration; air quality; algorithm; Article; autonomous vehicle; case study; computational fluid dynamics; concentration (parameter); controlled study; deceleration; measurement accuracy; motor vehicle; priority journal; traffic and transport; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077734433

However, additional nitrogen (N) inputs into the soil could offset the CO2 mitigation potential due to increasing N2O emissions. Integrated management approaches use organic and synthetic fertilizers to maximize yields while minimizing impacts by crop sequencing adapted to local conditions. The goal of this work was to test whether integrated management, centered on CC adoption, has the potential to maximize SOC stocks without increasing the soil greenhouse gas (GHG) net flux and other agro-environmental impacts such as nitrate leaching. To this purpose, we ran the DayCent bio-geochemistry model on 8,554 soil sampling locations across the European Union. We found that soil N2O emissions could be limited with simple crop sequencing rules, such as switching from leguminous to grass CC when the GHG flux was positive (source). Additional reductions of synthetic fertilizers applications are possible through better accounting for N available in green manures and from mineralization of soil reservoirs while maintaining cash crop yields. Therefore, our results suggest that a CC integrated management approach can maximize the agro-environmental performance of cropping systems while reducing environmental trade-offs. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","C sequestration; cover crops; ecosystems services; Greenhouse gases; N2O emissions; nitrate leaching","carbon sequestration; cropping practice; environmental impact; fertilizer application; global change; greenhouse gas; leaching; nitrogen dioxide; soil organic matter; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079051248

Surface temperatures and the occurrence of natural disasters have also increased. Considering the important role of forests in reducing emissions, China conducted a series of studies on carbon storage by forest vegetation that involved well-developed estimation methods. However, there are still uncertainties in predicting future changes in forest vegetation acting as a carbon sink. This study used data collected from 7801 national forest inventory (NFI) forest plots in 2003, 2008 and 2013 as well as related forest ecosystem biomass data. The dynamic growth, biomass and carbon storage of arbor, economic and shrubbery forests were studied. This study made a breakthrough in predicting forest biomass and carbon storage based on growth-related changes in forest vegetation in China, improved the accuracy of predicting arbor forest carbon storage and filled a gap in research on the carbon storage/sink properties of economic, shrubbery and bamboo forests. In the results of this study, from 2003 to 2050, the carbon storage, density and carbon sink of forest vegetation in China increased rapidly. Mature forests in China played a major role in the increase in carbon storage, and the quality of young, half-mature and mature forests steadily improved. China's forest carbon storage was mainly concentrated in the southwestern and northeastern regions, between which the southwestern region had the highest carbon density. In addition, carbon storage and density increased faster in the southwestern region than in the northeastern region. The carbon storage and density of forest vegetation were greater in Tibet than in other areas. The carbon storage of forest vegetation in Tibet increased faster than that in other areas, and the carbon density of forest vegetation in Xinjiang increased faster than that in other areas. In addition, the carbon storage and carbon density of forest vegetation in Ningxia increased slower than those in other areas. From 2020 to 2050, China's forest vegetation will absorb 22.14% of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, which will play an important role in slowing increases in greenhouse gases in the next 30 years. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Forest carbon sink measurement; Forest space effect; Forest vegetation growth; Forests reducing carbon emissions","Biomass; Digital storage; Disasters; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Vegetation; Biomass and carbon storages; Carbon emissions; Carbon sequestration potential; Forest carbon sinks; Forest vegetation; Fossil fuel combustion; National forest inventories; Space effects; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076843884

The EEMD method is used to decompose carbon price time series into several components, including some intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residue. Motivated by the fully local characteristics of a time series decomposed by EEMD, we adopt the traditional LPP and regularized LPP (RLPP) to forecast each component. This led to two forecasting models, called the EEMD-LPP and EEMD-RLPP, respectively. Based on the fine-to-coarse reconstruction principle, an auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach is used to forecast the high frequency IMFs, and LPP and RLPP is applied to forecast the low frequency IMFs and the residue. The study also proposes two other forecasting models, called the EEMD-ARIMA-LPP and EEMD-ARIMA-RLPP. The empirical study results showed that the EEMD-LPP and EEMD-ARIMA-LPP outperform the two other models. Furthermore, we examine the robustness and effects of parameter settings in the proposed model. Compared with existing state-of-art approaches, the results demonstrate that EEMD-ARIMA-LPP and EEMD-LPP can achieve higher level and directional predictions and higher robustness. The EEMD-LPP and EEMD-ARIMA-LPP are promising approaches for carbon price forecasting. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon price forecasting; Decomposition-ensemble framework; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Local polynomial prediction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055530903

This paper investigates the distributional effect of China's coal taxes on households before and after the reform. We find that about 30 percent of rural households and six percent of urban households are directly affected by the coal taxes, and that the directly affected households tend to be poor. We also find that provinces are affected differently by the coal taxes; the provinces that are more affected tend to have lower household income. By the Suits Index, we find that both the quantity-based and price-based coal taxes are regressive for residential consumers in China, and that the coal taxation reform had little effect on the regressivity of the coal tax. By simulation, we find that the regressivity of the coal tax could be reduced if the tax rate were set to be positively correlated with provincial household income. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coal tax; Distributional effect; Price-based tax; Quantity-based tax","Coal; Coal deposits; Conservation; Housing; Distributional effect; Household income; Pollution reduction; Price-based; Quantity-based tax; Residential consumers; Resource conservation; Rural households; Taxation; coal; energy policy; household income; price dynamics; regression analysis; resident population; tax reform; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079641141

While many studies have attempted to identify different methods to adapt pavements to future climate conditions, the potential economic impacts of the adaptations still remain largely unquantified. This study presents the results of a comprehensive life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) aimed at quantifying the potential economic impacts of a climate adaptation method, in which an upgraded asphalt binder (Performance Grade PG 76-22) is used in the construction and maintenance of flexible pavement sections in lieu of the original binder (PG 70-22) for improved resistance against high temperatures. For each of three major Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) districts with different climates, three case studies consisting of typical interstate, primary, and secondary pavement sections were considered. The LCCA accounted for the costs incurred during the mixture's production, maintenance, and use phases of the pavement life cycle by explicitly considering future climate projections, pavement life-cycle performance, maintenance effects, and work zone user delays. The study concludes that pavements using the upgraded binder not only perform better over time but are also economically advantageous compared to those with the original binder under the conditions of the anticipated future climate conditions (2020–2039). © 2019 The Authors.

Previous researches have revealed that the industry has dilemmas of unreasonable industrial structure and high pollution. Using the data of 30 provinces in 2006-2015 in China, this study calculated a comprehensive pollution indicator when estimating the possible pollution reduction brought by the optimization of industrial structure and then evaluated the reasonable level of capital allocation of provinces and industries by using the methods of nonlinear programming and stochastic frontier method. Under the target of collaborative emission reduction, the results show that the optimized output of China’s equipment manufacturing industry could be increased by 5.42%, the energy intensity could be reduced by about 10.4%, and the comprehensive emission intensity could be reduced by about 7.47%. Due to the industry heterogeneity and regional heterogeneity, industrial capacity should be transferred between industries and regions. Since the capital investment in the equipment manufacturing industry is significantly mismatched between industries and regions, the capital allocation of provincial industries in China needs to be adjusted properly. This study provides theoretically and practically reference for collaborative pollution reduction, industry restructure, spatial layout and capital investment, which contributes to achieving the stereoscopic optimization of equipment manufacturing industry. © 2020 Qiao et al.

This study investigates the decoupling relationship between industrial SO2 emissions and the industrial economy in China during 1996–2015. According to the decoupling results, the study period is divided into four stages: 1996–2001, 2001–2006, 2006–2010, and 2010–2015. These four stages are closely aligned with the major adjustments of the national socio-economic policies. Then, the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition method is used to analyze the driving factors of industrial SO2 emissions. The results demonstrate that the SO2 generation intensity and SO2 abatement are the major contributors to reducing industrial SO2 emissions, while the economic activity effect is the primary inhibitory factor. Moreover, the provincial results show that most provinces with weak decoupling state since 2006 are located in less developed provinces with energy-intensive industries. Besides, the economic structure and SO2 generation intensity show negative contributions to reducing industrial SO2 emissions in some of these regions. Based on the results, the attention should be focused on cleaner production to reduce industrial SO2 emissions further, and environmental policies should be tailored to local conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decomposition analysis; Decoupling analysis; Industrial sulfur dioxide emissions; LMDI method","sulfur dioxide; cleaner production; decomposition analysis; economic activity; economic structure; sulfur dioxide; sustainable development; Article; chemical analysis; China; decomposition; decoupling analysis; economic aspect; human; industrial waste; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077924939

We obtain the main empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes of the interannual variation in AP based on daily precipitation data from 97 stations throughout the MLYRB during 1980-2015. The results show that the first leading EOF mode accounts for 30.83% of the total variation. The spatial pattern shows uniform change over the whole region. The variance contribution of the second mode is 16.13%, and its spatial distribution function shows a north-south phase inversion. Based on previous research and the physical considerations discussed herein, we include 13 climate indices to reveal the major predictors. To obtain an acceptable prediction performance, we comprehensively rank the climate indices, which are sorted according to the values of the new standardized algorithm of information flow (NIF, a causality-based approach) and correlation coefficient (a traditional climate diagnostic tool). Finally, Tropical Indian Ocean Dipole (TIOD), Arctic Oscillation (AO), and other four indicators are chosen as the final predictors affecting the first mode of AP over the MLYRB; NINO3.4 SSTA (NINO3.4), Atlantic-European Circulation E Pattern (AECE), and other four indicators are the major predictors for the second mode. In the final prediction experiment, considering the time series prediction of principal components (PCs) to be a small-sample problem, the Bayesian linear regression (BLR) model is used for the prediction. The experimental results reveal that the BLR model can effectively capture the time series trends of the first two modes (the correlation coefficients are greater than 0.5), and the overall performance is significantly better than that of the multiple linear regression (MLR) model. The prediction factors and precipitation prediction results identified in this study can be referenced to rapidly obtain climatological information for AP over the MLYRB and improve the regional prediction of AP elsewhere, which will also help policymakers prepare appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures for future climate change. © 2020 by the authors.","Autumn precipitation; Bayesian linear regression; Causal correlation; Climate index; Information flow",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084326055

Governments and water regulators address increased water scarcity in a regional setting by introducing policy interventions, including non-structural, such as pricing mechanisms and quotas to affect demand, and supply management means, such as water storage and extraction. One of the most extreme policy interventions is to build infrastructure to move water from locations where it is abundant to locations facing scarcity. Such interventions are known as intra- and inter-basin transfers (IBTs) of water and have been quite frequently practiced in many river basins around the world in recent years. In moving water from one place to another benefits and costs are realized, some of which are private and some are public in nature. The objective of this paper is to discern whether or not the documented IBTs have been sustainable in addressing scarcity. Since very few quantitative cost benefit analyses are available for IBTs, we apply a variation of the QUAlitative Structural Approach for Ranking (QUASAR) method to 121 studies of documented IBTs within 40 territories and basins around the world, using five attributes of impact that were found to be associated with the transfers. Our findings suggest that the majority of the IBTs have been associated with overall negligible or negative impacts on the water-exporting regions, the water-transmitting regions, or the water-importing regions within the basins studied. Our findings also suggest that IBTs that were meant to relieve higher levels of water scarcity in the importing regions might be more prone to overall negative impacts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental justice; Impacts; Inter-basin water transfer; Irrigation; Q25; QUAlitative Structural Approach for Ranking (QUASAR); Water scarcity","numerical model; policy implementation; ranking; water management; water planning; water resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077753714

Natural attenuation occurs at pools and plumes, indicating that remediation might be possible. The aims of the study were: i) to assess the role of heterogeneity in the natural attenuation of these compounds, ii) determine degradation processes within this zone, and iii) identify dechlorinating microorganisms. For this, groundwater concentrations, redox-sensitive parameters, CSIA isotopic and DGGE molecular techniques were used. The main findings at depth of the transition zone were: (1) the important key control played by heterogeneity on natural attenuation of contaminants. (2) Heterogeneity caused the highly anoxic environment and dominant sulfate-reducing conditions, which accounts for more efficient natural attenuation. (3) Heterogeneity also explains that the transition zone constitutes an ecotone. (4) The bacteria size exclusion is governed by the pore throat threshold and determines the penetration of dechlorinating microorganisms into the finest sediments, which is relevant, since it implies the need to verify whether microorganisms proposed for bioremediation can penetrate these materials. (5) Reductive dechlorination caused the natural attenuation of contaminants in groundwater and porewater of fine sediments. In the case of carbon tetrachloride, it was an abiotic process biogenically mediated by A. suillum, a bacterium capable of penetrating the finest sediments. In the case of chloroform, it was a biotic process performed by a Clostridiales bacterium, which is unable to penetrate the finest materials. (6) Both microorganisms have potential to be biostimulated to dechlorinate contaminants in the source and the plume in the transition zone. These outcomes are particularly relevant given the longevity of DNAPL sources and have considerable environmental implications as many supply wells in industrial areas exploit aquifers contaminated by chlorinated solvents emerging from DNAPL pools accumulated on the low-conductivity layers in transition zones. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Azospira suillum; Carbon tetrachloride; Chloroform; Geological and textural heterogeneity in the transition zone; Natural attenuation; Reductive dechlorination","Aquifers; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Carbon tetrachloride; Chlorine compounds; Contamination; Dechlorination; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Lakes; Sediments; Sulfur compounds; Azospira suillum; Degradation process; Environmental implications; Groundwater concentrations; Molecular techniques; Reductive dechlorination; Sulfate-reducing conditions; Transition zones; Natural attenuation; carbon tetrachloride; chloroform; ground water; solvent; sulfate; carbon tetrachloride; chloroform; ground water; well water; aquifer; bioremediation; chloroform; concentration (composition); dechlorination; heterogeneity; microorganism; parameter estimation; transition zone; Article; bioaccumulation; bioremediation; bottom aquitard; Clostridiales; concentration (parameter); dechlorination; ecosystem restoration; ecotone; environmental aspects and related phenomena; microbial community; microbial degradation; nonhuman; plume; population abundance; priority journal; sediment; species diversity; swimming pool; transition zone; water pollutant; Azospira; Bacteria (microorganisms); Clostridiales; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon Tetrachloride; Chloroform; Groundwater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078897042

In this study, we review the effects of the water mass properties (temperature, salinity, food supply, carbonate chemistry, and oxygen) on deep-sea benthic megafauna (from species to community level) and discussed in future scenarios of climate change. We focus on the key oceanic controls on deep-sea megafauna biodiversity and biogeography patterns. We place particular attention on cold-water corals and sponges, as these are ecosystem-engineering organisms that constitute vulnerable marine ecosystems (VME) with high associated biodiversity. Besides documenting the current state of the knowledge on this topic, a future scenario for water mass properties in the deep North Atlantic basin was predicted. The pace and severity of climate change in the deep-sea will vary across regions. However, predicted water mass properties showed that all regions in the North Atlantic will be exposed to multiple stressors by 2100, experiencing at least one critical change in water temperature (+2°C), organic carbon fluxes (reduced up to 50%), ocean acidification (pH reduced up to 0.3), aragonite saturation horizon (shoaling above 1000 m) and/or reduction in dissolved oxygen (>5%). The northernmost regions of the North Atlantic will suffer the greatest impacts. Warmer and more acidic oceans will drastically reduce the suitable habitat for ecosystem-engineers, with severe consequences such as declines in population densities, even compromising their long-term survival, loss of biodiversity and reduced biogeographic distribution that might compromise connectivity at large scales. These effects can be aggravated by reductions in carbon fluxes, particularly in areas where food availability is already limited.

To better understand the photophysics and spectroscopy of azulene and other nonconventional molecules, we developed a systematic, general, and efficient computational approach combining the semiclassical dynamics of nuclei with ab initio electronic structure. First, to analyze the nonadiabatic effects, we complement the standard population dynamics by a rigorous measure of adiabaticity, estimated with the multiple-surface dephasing representation. Second, we propose a new semiclassical method for simulating non-Condon spectra, which combines the extended thawed Gaussian approximation with the efficient single-Hessian approach. S1 ← S0 and S2 ← S0 absorption and S2 → S0 emission spectra of azulene, recorded in a new set of experiments, agree very well with our calculations. We find that accuracy of the evaluated spectra requires the treatment of anharmonicity, Herzberg-Teller, and mode-mixing effects.

To a considerable extent, its meaning has been reduced to just two eye-catching images: sand dunes encroaching on productive land and habitations and bare, cracked soil surfaces. Yet neither of these is an indicator of desertification—sometimes called dryland degradation. Rather desertification results in a wide range of changes, including erosion, loss of biodiversity, decline in soil fertility, and reduced carbon storage. Surprisingly, it is the pictures themselves, not the scientific literature, that have fixed this erroneous concept in the minds of even some who work in the field of land degradation. The results of this confusion include inappropriate management efforts, mistaken premises in research, and ill-informed policies at local to global scales including misleading prognostications of institutions—even at the level of United Nations agencies. © 2019 The Authors.

Such phenomena exist in-cylinder at low-load in-city driving conditions where strict engine emission regulations apply, hence the need for faithful flash-boiling fuel spray models by engine designers. To enhance the current modelling capability of superheated fuel sprays, with focus on near-nozzle plume expansion, a flash-boiling breakup modelling approach was developed to introduce the thermal breakup mechanism of droplets caused by nucleation and bubble growth. This model was particularly aimed at sprays where levels of superheat introduced noticeable radial expansion of the plumes upon discharge from the nozzle orifice. The model was able to simulate droplet shattering by introducing Lagrangian child parcels at breakup sites with additional radial velocity components instigated by rapid bubble growth and surface instabilities. Combination of the flash-boiling droplet breakup model with a flash-boiling effective nozzle model that was used as boundary condition for the spray plumes offered a more complete modelling approach, where both in-nozzle phase change effects and near-nozzle flashing through droplet shattering were incorporated into the Eulerian-Lagrangian two-phase computational framework. Sensitivity studies were carried out to investigate important parameters which are inherently difficult to measure experimentally and offered valuable insight into modelling superheated sprays. The model was able to capture important flash-boiling spray characteristics and quantitative validation was achieved through comparison to experimental data in the form of penetration lengths and droplet sizes with a good level of agreement. © 2019",,"Drop breakup; Engines; Expansion; Fuels; Lagrange multipliers; Phase transitions; Two phase flow; Computational framework; Modelling capabilities; Phase change effects; Quantitative validation; Saturation pressure; Sensitivity studies; Spray characteristics; Surface instability; Spray nozzles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078018384

APiC, a novel adaptable pixel-based compositing and classification approach, is especially designed to use high resolution spatio-temporal space-borne data. Here, pixel-based compositing is used separately for training data and prediction data. First, cloud-free pixels covered by reference data are used within adapted composite periods to compile a training dataset. The compiled training dataset contains samples of spectral reflectances for respective land cover classes at each composite period. For land cover prediction, pixel-based compositing is then applied region-wide. Multiple prediction models are used based on temporal subsets of the compiled training dataset to dynamically account for cloud coverage at pixel level. Thus we present a data-driven classification approach which is applicable in regions with different weather conditions, species composition and phenology. The capability of our method is demonstrated by mapping 19 land cover classes across Germany for the year 2016 based on Sentinel-2A data. Since climatic conditions and thus plant phenology change on a large scale, the classification was carried out separately in six landscape regions of different biogeographical characteristics. The study drew on extensive ground validation data provided by the federal states of Germany. For each landscape region, composite periods of different lengths have been established, which differ regionally in their temporal arrangement as well as in their total number, emphasising the advantage of a flexible regionalised classification procedure. Using a random forest classifier and evaluating outcomes with independent reference data, an overall accuracy of 88% was achieved, with particularly high classification accuracy of around 90% for the major land cover types. We found that class imbalances have significant influence on classification accuracy. Based on multiple temporal subsets of the compiled training dataset, over 10,000 random forest models were calculated and their performance varied considerably across and within landscape regions. The calculated importance of composite periods show that a high temporal resolution of the compiled training dataset is necessary to better capture the different phenology of land cover types. In this study we demonstrate that APiC, due to its data-driven nature, is a very flexible compositing and classification approach making efficient use of dense satellite time series in areas with frequent cloud coverage. Hence, regionalisation can be given greater focus in future broad-scale classifications in order to facilitate better integration of small-scale biophysical conditions and achieve even better results in detailed land cover mapping. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Compositing; Crop mapping; Land cover classification; Phenology; Random forest; Sentinel-2","Decision trees; Forecasting; Forestry; Pixels; Plants (botany); Random forests; Remote sensing; Compositing; Crop mapping; Land cover classification; Phenology; Sentinel-2; Mapping; composting; crop plant; forest ecosystem; geological mapping; image resolution; land cover; phenology; pixel; regionalization; satellite imagery; Sentinel; time series analysis; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080983581

Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) is an evergreen perennial plant and cultivated over a wide region in the world, and its potential to sequestrate atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in plant biomass is already evaluated. However, proportions of assimilated CO2 which tea plant can sequestrate in their biomass and in soil are not evaluated before. In this experiment, ten (10) 6-month old tea plants of four different cultivars (TV1, TV20, S3A/3, and TV23) were transplanted in the field and CO2 assimilation flux of tea plants was periodically measured under in situ condition using close-chamber method at 15 days interval throughout the year. The cumulative CO2 assimilation flux of young tea plants varied within 31.82–249.22 g CO2 plant−1 year−1; however, it was estimated that tea bushes also emitted 5.2–70.8 g CO2 plant−1 year−1 due to aerobic respiration. After 1 year, tea plants were uprooted and the changes in their biomass were compared as the measure of their C-sequestration within the study duration. The weight gain in the whole plant biomass was proportional to the CO2 assimilation potential of tea cultivars. Overall, tea plants sequestrated 50.8% of the assimilated atmospheric CO2 in their biomass. The study revealed that tea bushes release organic C through the root exudates, the amount of which was equivalent to 5.9–8.6% of the assimilated CO2. Those secreted root exudates have potential to increase organic C up to 44–48 kg ha−1 year−1 in tea-growing soil. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Assimilated atmospheric CO2; Biomass gain; C sequestration; Tea","Atmospheric chemistry; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Cultivation; Aerobic respiration; Assimilated atmospheric CO2; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; C sequestration; Camellia sinensis; Carbon sequestration; North- East India; Perennial plants; Tea; carbon dioxide; organic carbon; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; cultivar; photosynthesis; plant; Article; biomass production; Camellia sinensis; carbon dioxide breathing; carbon dioxide fixation; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cultivar; environmental health; India; molecular weight; nonhuman; plant growth; root exudate; soil analysis; biomass; environmental monitoring; soil; tea; India; Camellia sinensis; Biomass; Camellia sinensis; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Environmental Monitoring; India; Soil; Tea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081177626

Based on Dutch policy advice we suggest basing the implementation on food systems thinking and to align public eco-schemes with private initiatives. Dutch policy seeks to create a circular agricultural system by 2030. As such, policy measures must contribute towards ‘closing leakages in material flows, cutting emissions and reducing wastage of biomass throughout the whole food system’. This corresponds with the objectives of the new CAP. Member States can transfer budget from the basic income support to the eco-schemes relatively easily, but the one year contracts proposed by the Commission would not ensure continuity for farmers. Farmers are incentivised first and foremost by markets and other food chain actors and it would therefore be more attractive to couple eco-schemes with private labelling systems, via a common integrated points system with performance indicators. Providers of sustainability schemes could apply for equivalence with eco-schemes. Farmers participating in an approved sustainability scheme would then, under the principle of compliance by default, automatically be given the possibility to take part in the equivalent eco-scheme. Management and oversight of compliance would be the responsibility of the organisation offering the sustainability scheme. This would have the benefit of reducing administrative costs. © 2020 Agricultural Economics Society and European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE)",,"agri-environmental policy; alternative agriculture; Common Agricultural Policy; European Commission; farming system; policy approach; strategic approach; sustainability; Europe; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084238746

The results showed that the US and EU decreased their emissions respectively by 12.4% and 5.9%. The US achieved emission reductions mainly due to the intensity effect (sector's own emissions) while the EU by technology effect (production chain's emissions).

To make more effective mitigation strategies, it is important to understand the influence on particulate matter (PM) from pollutants emitted in different European nations. In this study, we evaluate a country source contribution forecasting system aimed at assessing the domestic and transboundary contributions to PM in major European cities for an episode in December 2016. The system is composed of two models (EMEP/MSC-W rv4.15 and LOTOS-EUROS v2.0), which allows the consideration of differences in the source attribution. We also compared the PM10 concentrations, and both models present satisfactory agreement in the 4 d forecasts of the surface concentrations, since the hourly concentrations can be highly correlated with in situ observations. The correlation coefficients reach values of up to 0.58 for LOTOSEUROS and 0.50 for EMEP for the urban stations; the values are 0.58 for LOTOS-EUROS and 0.72 for EMEP for the rural stations. However, the models underpredict the highest hourly concentrations measured by the urban stations (mean underestimation of 36 %), which is to be expected given the relatively coarse model resolution used (0.25 longitude 0.125 latitude). For the source attribution calculations, LOTOS-EUROS uses a labelling technique, while the EMEP/MSC-W model uses a scenario having reduced anthropogenic emissions, and then it is compared to a reference run where no changes are applied. Different percentages (5 %, 15 %, and 50 %) for the reduced emissions in the EMEP/MSC-W model were used to test the robustness of the methodology. The impact of the different ways to define the urban area for the studied cities was also investigated (i.e. one model grid cell, nine grid cells, and grid cells covering the definition given by the Global Administrative Areas GADM).We found that the combination of a 15% emission reduction and a larger domain (nine grid cells or GADM) helps to preserve the linearity between emission and concentrations changes. The nonlinearity, related to the emission reduction scenario used, is suggested by the nature of the mismatch between the total concentration and the sum of the concentrations from different calculated sources. Even limited, this nonlinearity is observed in the NO3 , NHC 4 , and H2O concentrations, which is related to gas aerosol partitioning of the species. The use of a 15% emission reduction and of a larger city domain also causes better agreement on the determination of the main country contributors between both country source calculations. Over the 34 European cities investigated, PM10 was dominated by domestic emissions for the studied episode (1 9 December 2016). The two models generally agree on the dominant external country contributor (68%on an hourly basis) to PM10 concentrations. Overall, 75% of the hourly predicted PM10 concentrations of both models have the same top five main country contributors. Better agreement on the dominant country contributor for primary (emitted) species (70% is found for primary organic matter (POM) and 80% for elemental carbon EC) than for the inorganic secondary component of the aerosol (50 %), which is predictable due to the conceptual differences in the source attribution used by both models. The country contribution calculated by the scenario approach depends on the chemical regime, which largely impacts the secondary components, unlike the calculation using the labelling approach. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

The estimated changes in climatic conditions including increasing temperature, with particular attention to the summer means, together with the expected changes in the temporal precipitation distribution pose enormous challenge to the agriculture. Currently, dynamic system models are most frequently used tools that are capable of estimating the prospective effects of climate change on agro-ecosystems. A deterministic biogeochemical model is presented that is developed by Hungarian scientists within the framework of the AgroMo project. The main goal of the AgroMo project is to develop climate-smart strategies in order to mitigate the effect of potential future hazards in the context of climate change by 1) creating a complex, state-of-the-art experimental platform; 2) producing ten new, 0.1° spatial resolution climate scenarios based on the RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios; 3) developing an integrated assessment and modeling framework that is capable of simulating every major land use types; 4) analyzing/simulating a great number of adaptation strategies that can be used to support decision makers. Based on the preliminary simulation results, climate change will most likely expose significant negative impact on the spring sown crops in Hungary. Although, the yield losses could be avoided with irrigation or could be mitigated with earlier sowing, the role of winter crops is likely to become more significant in Hungary in the future. © INRA and Springer-Verlag France 2015.","Climate change; Crop yield; Model; Nitrate leaching; Secision support; Simulation","agricultural ecosystem; biogeochemistry; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; ecosystem service; sowing; Hungary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082671005

Due to the combustion principle and the related thermodynamic efficiency, it is especially challenging to meet future CO2 targets. The layout and optimization of the overall system requires novel methods in the development process which feature a seamless transition between real and virtual prototypes. Herein, engine models need to predict the entire engine operating range in steady-state and transient conditions and must respond to all relevant control inputs. In addition, the model must feature true real-time capability. This work presents a holistic and modular modeling framework, which considers all relevant processes in the complex chain of physical effects in SI combustion. The basis is a crank-resolved cylinder model which describes gas exchange and compression to determine the thermodynamic state and turbulence conditions at spark-advance. Ignition and flame front combustion are modeled by a mechanistic, quasi-dimensional combustion model with a detailed consideration of combustion chamber geometry for flame-wall interaction. Cycle-to-cycle variations are imposed in a semi-empirical manner in order to provide realistic boundary conditions for the thermo-chemical knock model. The models are validated against engine measurements for a passenger car sized TGDI engine in a wide range of operating conditions covering the entire engine map. Emphasis is put on comparing pressure and heat release traces, not only for the mean cycle, but for the range of stochastic variations of 100 measured cycles. The validation results confirm a good level of agreement between measured and simulated results. To demonstrate capabilities of the proposed modeling concept, a model-based optimization is performed in a computational study, aiming at an optimization of engine efficiency under knocking constraints. The study examines two motoric measures, namely water injection and variable compression ratio. Finally, the optimized model runs in a transient drivecycle simulation. The test is performed on a HiL system to prove the model's real-time capability. © 2020 SAE International.

Pollutants evidence for public health concern include coarse (PM10) and fine (PM2.5) particles. However, ultrafine particles (PM0.1) are assumed to be more toxic than larger particles, but data are still needed to better understand their mechanism of action. In this context, the aim of our work was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo genotoxic potential of fine (PM2.5-018) and quasi ultra-fine (PM0.18) particles from an urban-industrial area (Dunkirk, France) by using comet, micronucleus and/or gene mutation assays. In vitro assessment was performed with 2 lung immortalized cell lines (BEAS-2B and NCI-H292) and primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) grown at the air-liquid interface or in submerged conditions (5 µg PM/cm2). For in vivo assessment, tests were performed after acute (24 h, 100 µg PM/animal), subacute (1 month, 10 µg PM/animal) and subchronic (3 months, 10 µg PM/animal) intranasal exposure of BALB/c mice. In vitro, our results show that PM2.5-018 and PM0.18 induced primary DNA damage but no chromosomal aberrations in immortalized cells. Negative results were noted in primary cells for both endpoints. In vivo assays revealed that PM2.5-018 and PM0.18 induced no significant increases in DNA primary damage, chromosomal aberrations or gene mutations, whatever the duration of exposure. This investigation provides initial answers regarding the in vitro and in vivo genotoxic mode of action of PM2.5-018 and PM0.18 at moderate doses and highlights the need to develop standardized specific methodologies for assessing the genotoxicity of PM. Moreover, other mechanisms possibly implicated in pulmonary carcinogenesis, e.g. epigenetics, should be investigated. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Animal model; Fine and ultrafine particles; Genotoxicity; Human lung cell models","Air pollution; Biological organs; Cell culture; Genes; Mammals; Air liquid interfaces; Animal model; Chromosomal aberration; Fine and ultrafine particles; Genotoxicities; Human bronchial epithelial cells; Human lung cells; Submerged condition; Phase interfaces; air quality; atmospheric pollution; bioassay; environmental risk; genotoxicity; health impact; health risk; medical geography; particulate matter; public health; respiratory disease; adult; air pollution; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; BEAS-2B cell line; chromosome aberration; comet assay; controlled study; DNA damage; exposure; female; gene mutation; genotoxicity; HBEC cell line (bronchial epithelium); human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; in vivo study; industrial area; lung model; micronucleus test; microplastic pollution; middle aged; NCI-H292 cell line; nonhuman; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; urban area; air pollutant; animal; Bagg albino mouse; France; lung; mouse; particulate matter; Animalia; Mus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Animals; DNA Damage; France; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Particle Size; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076617011

Global warming has different effects on climate at the regional and local levels. The detection of changes in extreme events using instrumental data provides further evidence of such warming and allows for the characterization of its local manifestations. The present study analyzes changes in temperature and precipitation extremes in the Mexican state of Zacatecas using climate change indices developed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). We studied a 40-year period (1976-2015) using annual and seasonal time series. Maximum and minimum temperature data were used, as well as precipitation statistics from the Mexican climatology database (CLICOM) provided by the Mexican Meteorological Service. Weather stations with at least 80% of data availability for the selected study period were selected; these databases were subjected to quality control, homogenization, and data filling using Climatol, which runs in the R programming language. These homogenized series were used to obtain daily grids of the three variables at a resolution of 1.3 km. Results reveal important changes in temperature-related indices, such as the increase in maximum temperature and the decrease in minimum temperature. Irregular variability was observed in the case of precipitation, which could be associated with low-frequency oscillations such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The possible impact of these changes in temperature and the increased irregularity of precipitation could have a negative impact on the agricultural sector, especially given that the state of Zacatecas is the largest national bean producer. The most important problems in the short term will be related to the difficulty of adapting to these rapid changes and the new climate scenario, which will pose new challenges in the future. © 2020 by the authors.","Anomalies; Climate change; Climate extremes; Global warming; Precipitation; Temperature; Trends",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084295245

GTDI engines waste significant exhaust enthalpy; even at moderate loads the WG (Wastegate) starts to open to regulate the turbine power. This action is required to reduce EBP (Exhaust Back Pressure). Another factor is catalyst protection, where the emissions device is placed downstream turbine. Lambda enrichment or over-fueling is used to perform this. However, the turbine has a temperature drop across it when used for energy recovery. Since catalyst performance is critical for emissions, the only reasonable location for an additional device is downstream of it. This is a challenge for any additional energy recovery, but a smaller turbine is a design requirement, optimized to operate at lower pressure ratios. A WAVE model of the 2.0L GTDI engine was adapted to include a TG (Turbogenerator) and TBV (Turbine Bypass Valve) with the TG in a mechanical turbocompounding configuration, calibrated with steady state dynamometer data. This includes power and fuel consumption, and additionally a sensitivity analysis and knock impact assessment. Further work includes transient verification with WAVE-RT on WLTP and RDE drive cycles, estimating dynamic energy recovery, assessing electrical turbocompounding, interfacing to the powergrid, and calibration optimisation, using combined WG and TBV settings.

Two key technologies which offer great potential for climate change mitigation are electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energies (REs). Thus, there is the need for innovative and stable policies in order to favor these technologies. The purpose of the study is to identify and compare features of policies for the integration of EVs, REs, and information and communication technology (ICT). This study uses an integrated Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT), and Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal (PESTEL) qualitative methodology in order to show different policies and initiatives, related to e-mobility, RE and ICT, collected from five European regions. This research provides discernments to the EVs and RE challenges, such as the lack of capacity to deal with high energy demands or limited EV-charging infrastructure. On the contrary, a high percentage of REs share, raising climate change awareness, and decreasing EV prices which are great opportunities for the whole EU. Such insights encourage policymakers and other groups of interest to improve their RE and mobility policies, which could lead to effective sustainable mobility systems in urban areas. © 2020 by the authors.","Electric vehicle; Renewable energy; Sustainable mobility; Transport policy","alternative energy; climate change; demand analysis; electricity industry; energy policy; European Union; information and communication technology; policy making; urban area; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083483379

MAHLE Jet Ignition® (MJI) is one such concept which enables ultra-lean (λ > ~1.6) combustion via air dilution. This pre-chamber-based combustion system has demonstrated highly efficient lean operation, producing efficiencies competitive with those of advanced compression ignition concepts. Compared to a traditional spark ignition engine, the additional degrees of freedom associated with Jet Ignition introduce further complexity when optimizing the system for peak efficiency throughout the engine map. The relationship between operating condition and the lambda at which peak efficiency occurs for a Jet Ignition engine has been presented in prior work by the authors. This paper further explores this complex relationship, introducing new interdependencies which must be considered in order to improve brake thermal efficiency (BTE). Experimental data is obtained from a 1.5L 3-cylinder gasoline-fueled Jet Ignition engine. An engine map of BTE is presented. An analysis at several key points throughout the engine map shows how certain parameters are adjusted to optimize BTE, providing a peak value >42%. Insight into the factors affecting efficiency is provided through parameter sweeps of pre-chamber fuel and analysis of high-speed pressure measured in both the pre-chamber and the main combustion chamber. The impact of precise fuel metering on BTE and combustion stability is highlighted. Finally, an analysis of trends in burn duration segments, pre-chamber combustion metrics, and cycle-by-cycle variation in these parameters qualifies the challenges associated with accurate prediction of lean stability limits in a jet ignition engine operating in the ultra-lean region, as well as the opportunities for further efficiency improvement through manipulation of in-pre-chamber conditions. © 2020 SAE International.

But if people feel excluded from decision making, this can fuel resistance to such policies. Legal frameworks, such as the Aarhus Convention, mandate extensive obligations to engage the public in decision making on local projects, such as renewable energy siting. But such frameworks often overlook the macro-level decisions that affect local projects. Public influence at a project level may be limited by such macro-level decisions. A solution could be to engage the public earlier in the decision-making chain. But is this what people want? In this Perspective, we present a survey in the Netherlands (n = 1,121) that revealed that people want to participate most in decision making on local projects—exactly where their influence is most limited due to legal constraints. We propose a cross-disciplinary research agenda for studying how to reconcile legal frameworks and public preferences for participation to reach socially acceptable climate policies. © 2020 The Authors","climate policy; decision-making chain; macro-level decisions; mandated public participation; micro-level decisions; procedural fairness; public acceptability; public participation","decision making; environmental policy; legislation; local participation; policy making; preference behavior; Netherlands",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091365400

Simulation tools can assist in improving industrial operations, but the models presented so far in the literature to describe bioethanol production from sugar cane were developed under conditions far from industrial reality, at the bench scale and with highly controlled fermentation variables. This hampers the use of these models to find optimized input conditions to increase industrial bioethanol production. In the present work, a framework based on artificial intelligence techniques combining the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was developed to optimize industrial bioethanol production. Industrial data from a mill in the state of São Paulo (Brazil) were used to train the ANN. The databank comprised 3400 experimental values (200 operation days) of the whole fermentation unit. The trained ANN model was able to predict the bioethanol concentration at the end of the process with high accuracy and enabled the optimization of the input variables to maximize bioethanol production of the mill using the PSO algorithm. The results showed an increase of about 10% in bioethanol concentration and production at the end of fermentation per harvest for the industrial unit taken as a case study. This new approach enhances the knowledge about the industrial ethanol fermentation process and can become a tool to guide new studies regarding the increase of biofuels production, mainly the ones which present behavior with high nonlinearity. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Ethanol; Fermentation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sugar cane; Artificial intelligence techniques; Artificial neural network models; Bio-ethanol production; Experimental values; Fermentation variables; Industrial operations; Industrial production; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Bioethanol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082537858

However, the influence of composition of various land use types and their configuration, i.e. landscape pattern, on regional temperature is still unknown. We test the hypotheses: (1) surface air temperature would vary according to landscape pattern, and (2) these effects would vary, demonstrating scale- and site-dependence effects through different vegetation transpiration rates. The relationships of 360 landscape metrics, indicating multiple dimensions of landscape pattern, and regional temperature at five climatic zones at five spatial scales in southern hilly China were examined through Pearson correlation analysis, stepwise regression and redundancy analysis. The area and number of grassland, building, and dry cropland patches are positively correlated with temperature; the area and density of forestland, shrubland, wet cropland, and water patches have cooling effects. The optimal scale and landscape metrics are also different between different climate zones. Landscape-level vegetation transpiration, determined by the dominant species, may partially explain why landscape pattern affects regional temperature. These findings provide new insights for understanding land use–temperature interactions and designing climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. Suitable landscape pattern, optimal scale, and dominant species should be considered in landscape planning and land use management to mitigate the impacts of the projected climatic warming. © 2020","Landscape pattern; Regional temperature; Scale effect; Vegetation transpiration","Atmospheric temperature; Correlation methods; Land use; Transpiration; Urban planning; Vegetation; Landscape pattern; Multiple dimensions; Pearson correlation analysis; Redundancy analysis; Scale effects; Stepwise regression; Surface air temperatures; Transpiration rates; Land surface temperature; air temperature; correlation; identification key; land surface; land use; regional climate; regression analysis; scale effect; transpiration; warming; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077507911

One of the biggest problems arising from joining financial goals with social goals is the presence of increasing tensions between the members and stakeholders involved. Nevertheless, there has not been enough focus on how managers, employees, and stakeholders respond to the tensions caused by contradictions and how they try to reach a balance between financial, environmental, and social goals. Therefore, the present study is aimed at investigating how members of an agricultural cooperative in the Apulia region (Italy) try to join the organizational forms of business and social values, namely, the sustainable practices related to CO2 emission reduction, resource use efficiency, and food waste mitigation. Additionally, the study goes further and explores whether and how these contradictory pressures are solved. Starting from the sensemaking approach, the study carried out an inductive case study through the use of a multiple case study design and in-depth interviews.

Applications derived from high spatio-temporal resolution observation of precipitations are to make our cities more weather-ready. Finer resolution data available from dual polarised X-band radar measurements enhance engineering tools as used for urban planning policies as well as protection (mitigation/adaptation) strategies to tackle climate-change related weather events. For decades engineering tools have been developed to work conveniently either with very local rain gauge networks, or with mainly C-band radars that have gradually been set up for space-time remote sensing of precipitation. Most of the time, the C-band radars continue to be calibrated by the existing rain gauge networks. Inhomogeneous distributions of these networks lead to only a partial information on the rainfall fields. Here we show that the statistics of measured rainfall is strongly biased by the fractality of the measuring networks and that this fractality needs to be properly taken into account to retrieve the original properties of the rainfall fields, in spite of the radar data calibration. In this work, we use the semi-distributed hydrological modelling over the Bièvre catchment to generate a virtual rain gauges’ network. And, firstly, performing a fractal analysis of this network distribution, we demonstrate that the semi-distributed hydrological models statistically reduce the distributed (weather radar) rainfall fields into rainfall measured by a much scarcer network of virtual rain gauges. Then, with the help of the Intersection Theorem and multifractal theory, we statistically compare the virtual rain gauges’ data with the rainfall data measured by the dual-polarimetric X-band radar operated at Ecole des Ponts with a spatial resolution of 250 m, providing pre-factors that indicate the need of a proper re-normalisation of rain gauge rainfall data when comparing (or calibrating) with radar data and the possible counter productivity of this conditioning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Fractals; Multifractals; Rain gauge network; Semi-distributed hydrological model; Spatio-temporal variability; X-band radar","Catchments; Climate change; Fractals; Meteorological radar; Radar measurement; Rain gages; Remote sensing; Urban planning; Water management; Multifractals; Rain gauge networks; Semi distributed hydrological models; Spatiotemporal variability; X-band Radars; Rain; calibration; climate change; fractal analysis; hydrological modeling; network analysis; precipitation (climatology); radar; raingauge; remote sensing; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; urban planning; urban policy; weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078535945

Nevertheless, the kinetics of the ORR or rate of reaction is relatively slow. Recently, researchers theoretically report that, the bimetallic platinum-nickel supported on carbon black (Pt-Ni/C) have extremely high ORR activities. Therefore, this work aims to synthesize Pt-Ni/C nanoparticles electrocatalysts for ORR via solid-state chemistry method (gas phase synthesis), which involved impregnation of metal precursors on supported carbon and reducing them in an environment of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) gases mixture. The Pt-Ni nanoparticles were prepared with different carbon (i.e. Graphene, Vulcan XC-72R and Ketjen black). The ORR activities and durability of these electrocatalysts were examined by voltammetry technique, which consisted of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) under acidic condition. The results demonstrated that different types of carbon supporters could affect the ORR catalytic activities. Pt-Ni nanoparticles supported on ketjen black (Pt-Ni/K) had the highest ORR activities for both specific activity (SA) and mass activity (MA). Furthermore, after 4,000 voltage cycles of the accelerated durability test (ADT), the Pt-Ni/Ketjen black still showed better ORR stability than Pt-Ni/Vulcan XC-72R and Pt-Ni/Graphene, respectively. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In these climate action plans, most developing countries make their mitigation and adaptation contributions conditional upon receiving international support (finance, technology transfer and/or capacity building). While provision of support for NDC implementation could enhance equity among countries, the feasibility of NDC implementation might be challenged by the large number of conditional NDCs. This paper addresses the implications of this tension based on an analysis of all 168 NDCs. We find that feasibility is challenged because conditions applied to NDCs are often not well defined. Moreover, the costs of implementing all conditional contributions are too high to be covered by existing promises of support from developed countries, even if the entire annual $100 billion of climate finance were earmarked for NDC implementation. Consistent with principles of equity and the prioritization in the Paris Agreement, a higher proportion of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have conditional NDCs than do other countries. However, differences between the distribution of countries requesting support and those currently receiving support, in particular among middle-income countries, demonstrates potential tensions between feasibility and equity. The article concludes with recommendations on how cost estimates and updated NDCs can be strengthened to ensure support for NDC implementation is targeted more equitably and cost-effectively. Key policy insights Support requested by developing countries to implement conditional NDCs far exceeds existing funding pledges. Differences between existing patterns of financial assistance, and those implied by requests under conditional NDCs, mean that supporting NDCs may require a significant shift in provider countries’ priorities for allocating climate finance. This may challenge feasibility. The Paris Agreement’s provisions on prioritizing LDCs and SIDS offer valuable guidance in making difficult choices on allocating support. To increase the likelihood of attracting support, developing countries (assisted by capacity building as needed), should include credible cost estimates in future NDCs and formulate investment plans. By outlining plans to mobilize support in their NDCs, developed countries can reassure developing countries that raising the ambition of NDCs is feasible. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Reducing and eliminating the emission from public transportation vehicles plays a major role in contributing towards lowering the emission level. Battery electric buses are regarded as a type of promising green mass transportation as they provide the advantage of less greenhouse gas emissions per passenger. However, the electric bus faces a problem of limited range and is not able to drive throughout the day without being recharged. This research studies a public bus transit system example which servicing the city of Ann Arbor in Michigan and investigates the impact of different electrification levels on the final CO2 reduction. Utilizing models of a conventional diesel, hybrid electric, and battery electric bus, the CO2 emission for each type of transportation bus is estimated. Vehicle speed data collected from various bus drives over different routes under different driving conditions are used to investigate the variability of drive conditions on performance metrics. Finally, recommendations are made for charge requirements of battery electric buses considering the variation in drive conditions which can result to an increase in the required charging time as high as 20%. © 2020 SAE International.

In this study, the computer program Advanced System for Process Engineering Plus (ASPEN Plus) was used to develop models to assess the process performance of such a process with manganese (Mn)-based oxygen carriers on alumina (Al2O3) support for a location in the region of Seville in Spain, using real solar beam irradiance and electricity demand data. It was shown that the utilisation of olive tree prunings (Olea europaea) as the fuel—an agricultural residue produced locally—results in negative CO2 emissions (a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere). Furthermore, it was found that the process with an annual average electricity output of 18 MW would utilise 2.43% of Andalusia’s olive tree prunings, thereby capturing 260.5 k-tonnes of CO2, annually. Drawbacks of the system are its relatively high complexity, a significant energy penalty in the CLAS process associated with the steam requirements for the loop-seal fluidisation, and the gas storage requirements. Nevertheless, the utilisation of agricultural residues is highly promising, and given the large quantities produced globally (~ 4 billion tonnes/year), it is suggested that other novel processes tailored to these fuels should be investigated, under consideration of a future price on CO2 emissions, integration potential with a likely electricity grid system, and based on the local conditions and real data. © 2019, The Author(s).","BECCS; Bio energy with CO2 capture; Chemical looping; Chemical looping air separation (CLAS); Climate change mitigation; CLOU; CO2 capture; Concentrated solar power (CSP); Energy storage; Mn oxygen carrier; Negative CO2 emissions; Olive grove; Olive tree pruning; Oxygen uncoupling","bioenergy; biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; energy efficiency; performance assessment; power plant; separation; simulation; solar power; thermochemistry; Andalucia; Sevilla; Seville; Spain; Olea europaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070351231

The controller employs a dynamic mechanistic model for this process, which allows for a precise treatment of the sources of uncertainty. In the case of the absorber, the model enables explicit consideration of uncertainty in the process operating conditions dictated by upstream units and in physical property parameters associated with phenomenological descriptions of the process. Using the multi-scenario approach, discrete realizations of the uncertain parameters inside a given uncertainty region can be incorporated into the controller to produce control actions that result in a robust operation in closed-loop. The multi-scenario controller was tested under several disturbance rejection scenarios of varying complexity and their performance was assessed against that of single-scenario NMPCs. The benefits of the robust NMPC approach were most evident for longer simulations and, considering the continuous nature of a power plant and its emissions, make the robust NMPC approach suitable for the operation of this process in the presence of uncertainty and disturbances. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Model Predictive Control; Post-combustion CO2 capture; Process uncertainty","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Disturbance rejection; Fossil fuel power plants; Model predictive control; Nonlinear systems; Uncertainty analysis; CO2 capture; Coal-fired power plant; Mechanistic modeling; Phenomenological description; Physical property parameters; Process uncertainties; Sources of uncertainty; Uncertain parameters; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077011923

Biogeochemical processes occurring in wetlands are still poorly described by mechanistic models and hence their dynamic response to environmental changes are weakly predicted. We investigated wetland GHG emissions, relevant electron acceptors and donors concentrations, and microbial composition resulting from changes in temperature, CH4 plant uptake efficiency, and SO (Formula presented.) deposition using a mechanistic biogeochemical model (here called BAMS3) that integrates the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) cycles. Parameters constraining the coupled C-N-S cycles were retrieved from controlled experiments and were validated against independent field data of CH4 emissions, and CH4(aq) and SO (Formula presented.) concentration profiles in a wetland in southern Michigan, USA (Shannon &amp; White, 1994, http://hdl.handle.net/102.100.100/236252?index=1). We found that +1.75 °C increase in temperature leads to 22% and 30% increment in CH4 and N2O emissions, respectively. A decrease in the CH4 plant uptake efficiency causes the prevalent CH4 emission pathway to become diffusion mediated and resulted in 50% increase in the daily average CH4 emissions. Finally, a decreasing SO (Formula presented.) deposition rate can increase CH4 emissions up to 5%. We conclude that the increasing GHG emissions from wetlands is a result of both environmental and anthropogenic causes rather than global warming alone. An increase in model complexity does not necessary improve the estimation of GHG emissions but it aids interpretation of intermediate processes to a greater detail. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

In this work, a synoptic circulation-to-environment classification method was adopted to elucidate the relationship between distinct atmospheric patterns and pollen levels for the 11 most abundant but also allergenic taxa in Thessaloniki, Greece, for the 15-year period 1987–2001. It was found that the NW1 depressional weather type is associated with the “low winter pollen season” and high levels of pollen from Carpinus spp., Corylus spp., Cupressaceae, Platanus spp., Pinaceae, Quercus spp. and Urticaceae. In contrast, the SW1 cyclonic type is linked to the “high spring-summer pollen season” and high levels of pollen from Oleaceae and Urticaceae. On the other hand, anticyclonic weather is associated with the “summer-autumn pollen season” and high levels of Poaceae and Chenopodiaceae pollen in the atmosphere. Regional transport of Alnus pollen is linked to a strong high-pressure system centered over Italy, giving light NE winds over northern Greece.

Here we examine how, and by how much, decadal ENSO variability affects decadal variability of the global carbon cycle by analyzing a 1,801-year preindustrial control simulation. We identify two different aspects, together explaining ~36% of the decadal variations in the global carbon cycle. First, climate variations induced by decadal ENSO-like variability regulate terrestrial carbon flux and hence atmospheric CO2 on decadal time scales. Second, decadal changes in the asymmetrical response of the terrestrial ecosystem, resulting from decadal modulation of ENSO amplitude and asymmetry, rectify the background mean state, thereby generating decadal variability of land carbon fluxes. ©2020.

Geopolymers are considered as environmentally friendly materials, due to the low processing temperature and the absence of CO2 gas emissions. These ecological features, linked to their technical properties, such as high strength, high acid resistance, and/or high-temperature resistance, make them very innovative technological materials. In addition, geopolymers show good performance if realized by the utilization of secondary raw materials (industrial wastes like fly ash or slag), thus improving strong interest in such technology from countries with growing industrialization. Here, in order to reduce global impacts and to stimulate the Sicilian green economy, we provide the evaluation of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) through the employ of local raw materials to produce geopolymers in Sicily. To reach this aim, geopolymers have been produced in collaboration with a Sicilian cement industry, through the use of local raw materials (furnace blast slag from Sicilian steelworks and Calabrian kaolinite) and the construction of a pilot plant. The obtained results show, for different scenarios, a considerable reduction of both CO2 emissions and energy consumption, but also a general improvement of the environmental indicators. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085393232

Recent work has demonstrated the importance of cloud-radiative effects (CRE) for the mean circulation of the extratropical atmosphere and its response to global warming. In contrast, little research has been done regarding the impact of CRE on internal variability. Here, we study how clouds and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) couple on synoptic time-scales during Northern Hemisphere winter via CRE within the atmosphere (ACRE). A regression analysis based on 5-day mean data from CloudSat/CALIPSO, CERES and GERB satellite observations and ERA-Interim short-term forecast data reveals a robust dipole of high-level and low-level cloud-incidence anomalies during a positive NAO, with increased high-level cloud incidence along the storm track (near 45°N) and the subpolar Atlantic, and decreased high-level cloud incidence poleward and equatorward of this track. Opposite changes occur for low-level cloud incidence. The cloud anomalies lead to an anomalous column-mean heating from ACRE over the region of the Iceland low, and to a cooling over the region of the Azores high. To quantify the impact of the ACRE anomalies on the NAO, and to thereby test the hypothesis of a cloud-radiative feedback on the NAO persistence, we apply the surface pressure tendency equation for ERA-Interim short-term forecast data. The NAO-generated ACRE anomalies amplify the NAO-related surface pressure anomalies over the Azores high but have no area-averaged impact on the Iceland low. In contrast, diabatic processes as a whole, including latent heating and clear-sky radiation, strongly amplify the NAO-related surface pressure anomalies over both the Azores high and the Iceland low, and their impact is much more spatially coherent. This suggests that, while atmospheric cloud-radiative effects lead to an increase in NAO persistence on synoptic time-scales, their impact is relatively minor and much smaller than other diabatic processes. © 2020 The Authors.

As these characteristics vary with laser parameters and modes of laser operation, the clinical trials and in vivo studies render it difficult to explore these aspects for optimization of the laser machining parameters. In light of this, the current work explores various thermal and microstructural aspects of laser-ablated cortical bone in ex vivo study to understand the fundamentals of laser-bone interaction using computational modeling. The study employs the Yb-fiber Nd:YAG laser (λ = 1064 nm) in the continuous wave mode to machine the femur section of bovine bone by a three-dimensional machining approach. The examination involved thermal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry, phase analysis using X-ray diffractometry, qualitative analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and microstructural and semiquantitative analysis using scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive spectrometry. The mechanism of efficient bone ablation using the Nd:YAG laser was evaluated using the computational thermokinetics outcome. The use of high laser fluence (10.61 J/mm2) was observed to be efficient to reduce the residual amorphous carbon in the heat-affected zone while achieving removal of the desired volume of the bone material at a rapid rate. Minimal thermal effects were predicted through computational simulation and were validated with the experimental outcome. In addition, this work reveals the in situ formation of a scaffold-like structure in the laser-machined region which can be conducive during healing. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","finite element method (FEM) modeling; laser ablation; laser osteotomy; orthopedic; scaffold","Ablation; Amorphous carbon; Carbonization; Differential scanning calorimetry; Heat affected zone; Laser ablation; Mammals; Neodymium lasers; Scaffolds; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermoanalysis; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Yttrium aluminum garnet; Computational model; Computational simulation; Continuous wave modes; Energy dispersive spectrometry; In-situ formations; Microstructural aspects; Qualitative analysis; Semi-quantitative analysis; Bone; carbon; collagen type 1; hydroxyapatite; animal tissue; Article; bone tissue; bovine; computer model; computer simulation; controlled study; cortical bone; differential scanning calorimetry; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; environmental temperature; ex vivo study; heat loss; heat transfer; laser surgery; melting temperature; nonhuman; osteotomy; priority journal; qualitative analysis; scanning electron microscopy; surface property; thermal analysis; thermal injury; thermogravimetry; X ray diffraction; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; animal; bone; cortical bone; diagnostic imaging; low level laser therapy; solid state laser; Animals; Bone and Bones; Cattle; Cortical Bone; Laser Therapy; Lasers, Solid-State; Osteotomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083893493

Equivalent BC (EBC) measurements were conducted using a 7-wavelength aethalometer, from March to May 2016, over an urban atmosphere, viz., Chiang Mai (98.957°E, 18.795°N, 373 m above sea level), Thailand in northern peninsular Southeast Asia. Daily variations in aerosol light absorption were mainly governed by open fire activities in the region. The mean mass-specific absorption cross-section (MAC) value of EBC at 880 nm was estimated to be 9.3 m2 g−1. The median EBC mass concentration was the highest in March (3.3 μg m−3) due to biomass-burning (comprised of forest fire and agricultural burning) emissions accompanied by urban air pollution within the planetary boundary layer under favorable meteorological conditions. Daily mean absorption Ångström exponent (AAE470/950) varied between 1.3 and 1.7 and could be due to variations in EBC emission sources and atmospheric mixing processes. EBC source apportionment results revealed that biomass-burning contributed significantly more to total EBC concentrations (34–92%) as compared to fossil-fuel (traffic emissions). Health risk estimates of EBC in relation to different health outcomes were assessed in terms of passive cigarette equivalence, highlighting the considerable health effects associated with exposure to EBC levels. As a necessary action, the reduction of EBC emissions would promote considerable climate and health co-benefits. © 2020 Elsevier LtdThe characteristics and health risks of atmospheric black carbon are investigated over an urban location in northern peninsular Southeast Asia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aethalometer model; Biomass burning; Fossil fuel; Passive cigarette equivalence","Biomass; Boundary layers; Carbon; Deforestation; Fossil fuels; Health; Light absorption; Risk assessment; Sea level; Tobacco; Aerosol light absorption; Aethalometer; Atmospheric-mixing process; Biomass-burning; Meteorological condition; Passive cigarette equivalence; Planetary boundary layers; Source apportionment; Health risks; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; black carbon; boundary layer; concentration (composition); fossil fuel; health risk; source apportionment; urban atmosphere; Southeast Asia; carbon; aerosol; air pollutant; atmosphere; biomass; chemistry; environmental monitoring; human; risk assessment; Southeast Asia; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Asia, Southeastern; Atmosphere; Biomass; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077321332

Evaporation dynamics of interacting sessile droplets is strongly influenced by the proximity of adjacent droplets. We study the effects of droplet-droplet vapor-mediated interactions on the evaporation lifetime of two-dimensional arrays of sessile water droplets. We observe that the presence of neighboring droplets acts as a mode of vapor accumulation which slows down the evaporation process. By considering an arbitrarily configured two-dimensional array of droplets, here we provide a simple generalized theoretical limit to their lifetime in an evaporating state. Using a scaling analysis, we put forward that the sessile droplet lifetime in a two-dimensional array is a linear function of the extent of confinement for various surface wettability and droplet geometric parameters (contact angle and contact radius). Notwithstanding the geometrical and physical complexity of the effective confinement generated due to their cooperative interactions, we show that the consequent evaporation characteristics may be remarkably insensitive to the topographical details of the overall droplet organization for a wide range of droplet-substrate combinations. With subsequent deployment of particle-laden droplets, however, our results lead to the discovery of a unique pathway towards tailoring the internal flows within the collective system by harnessing an exclusive topologically driven symmetry-breaking phenomenon, yielding a strategy of patterning particulate matters around the droplet array. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,"Contact angle; Evaporation; Cooperative interactions; Effective confinements; Evaporation process; Gaseous environments; Mediated interaction; Physical complexity; Surface wettability; Two-dimensional arrays; Drop formation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084537941

Yet what is usually known as “climate extremes” does not always translate into very high or low carbon fluxes or so-called “carbon extremes.” To reveal the patterns of how climate extremes influence terrestrial carbon fluxes, we analyzed the interannual variations in ecosystem carbon fluxes simulated by the Terrestrial Biosphere Models (TBMs) in the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project. At the global level, TBMs simulated reduced ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP; 18.5 ± 9.3 g C m−2 yr−1), but enhanced heterotrophic respiration (Rh; 7 ± 4.6 g C m−2 yr−1) during extremely hot events. TBMs also simulated reduced NPP (60.9 ± 24.4 g C m−2 yr−1) and reduced Rh (16.5 ± 11.4 g C m−2 yr−1) during extreme dry events. Influences of precipitation extremes on terrestrial carbon uptake were larger in the arid/semiarid zones than other regions. During hot extremes, ecosystems in the low latitudes experienced a larger reduction in carbon uptake. However, a large fraction of carbon extremes did not occur in concert with either temperature or precipitation extremes. Rather these carbon extremes are likely to be caused by the interactive effects of the concurrent temperature and precipitation anomalies. The interactive effects showed considerable spatial variations with the largest effects on NPP in South America and Africa. Additionally, TBMs simulated a stronger sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to precipitation than satellite estimates. This study provides new insights into the complex ecosystem responses to climate extremes, especially the emergent properties of carbon dynamics resulting from compound climate extremes. ©2020.

The radiative loss from the localized mix and local cooling of the reacting plasma conditions was quantified using neutron and x-ray images to reconstruct the hot spot conditions during thermonuclear burn. Such localized features arise from ablator material that is injected into the hot spot from the Rayleigh-Taylor growth of capsule surface perturbations, particularly the tube used to fill the capsule with deuterium and tritium fuel. Observations, consistent with analytic estimates, show the degradation to fusion energy production to be linearly proportional to the fraction of the total emission that is associated with injected ablator material and that this radiative loss has been the primary source of variations, of up to 1.6 times, in observed fusion energy production. Reducing the fill tube diameter has increased the ignition metric χno α from 0.49 to 0.72, 92% of that required to achieve a burning hot spot. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,"Explosions; Capsule surfaces; Inertial confinement; Linearly proportional; Localized features; Plasma conditions; Rayleigh-Taylor growth; Thermonuclear burns; Total emissions; Inertial confinement fusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082666194

In response, states offer depictions of the future in which technological and economic evolutions render our current climate crisis less challenging and costly.

Production of reproducible high-quality beans is a major challenge because most fermentations occur in open containers with a lack of variable control. Here we present a study that aims to identify the effect of farm protocols, climate, and bean mass exposure, in the dynamics and composition of microbial communities. Using high-throughput sequencing of molecular markers for bacteria and yeasts, complemented with culture-based methods, we evaluated the microbial diversity and dynamics associated to spontaneous cocoa fermentation in two distinct agro-ecological zones in Colombia. The bacterial communities were classified at two levels of evolutionary relationship, at a coarse resolution (OTU-level) and at a finer resolution (oligotype-level). A total of six bacterial OTUs were present in both farms, following a microbial succession that starts with the Enterobacteraceae family (one OTU), transitioning to the Lactobacillaceae family (three OTUs), and finishing with Acetobacteraceae family (two OTUs). When undesirable practices were done, OTUs were observed at unexpected moments during the fermentation. At a finer taxonomic resolution, 48 oligotypes were identified, with 46 present in both farms. These oligotypes have different patterns of prevalence. In the case of Lactobacillaceae a high evenness was observed among oligotypes. In contrast, for Enterobacteraceae and Acetobacteraceae a high dominance of one or two oligotypes was observed, these oligotypes were the same for both farms, despite geographic location and season of sampling. When the overall fermentations were compared using correlations matrices of oligotypes abundance, they show a clear clustering by farm, suggesting that farm protocols generate a unique fingerprint in the dynamics and interactions of the microbial communities. The comparison between the upper and middle layers of the bean mass showed that environmental exposure affects the paces at which ecological successions occur, and therefore, is an important source of cocoa quality heterogeneity. In conclusion, the results presented here showed that the dynamics of microbial fermentation can be used to identify the sources of variability and evidence the need for better fermentation technologies that favor the production of reproducible high-quality cocoa beans. © Copyright © 2020 Pacheco-Montealegre, Dávila-Mora, Botero-Rute, Reyes and Caro-Quintero.","amplicon sequencing; cocoa bean fermentation; fermentation heterogeneity; microbial dynamics; oligotypes","Acetobacteraceae; agricultural land; amplicon; article; bacterium culture; climate; cocoa bean; Colombia; community succession; environmental exposure; high throughput sequencing; Lactobacillaceae; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; prevalence; season; yeast",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083991798

The study extends understanding on how the properties of lubricating oil affect the nanoparticle emissions from an off-road diesel engine. The lubricants were selected among the performance classes of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, at least one lubricant from each category intended for heavy-duty diesel engines. Particle size distributions were measured by the means of an engine exhaust particle sizer (EEPS), but soot emissions, gaseous emissions and the basic engine performance were also determined. During the non-road steady state cycle, the most of the differences were detected at the particle size range of 6-15 nm. In most cases, the lowest particle quantities were emitted when the highest performance category lubricant was used. Based on the results of this study, the low contents of Zn, P, and S in lubricating oil contributed to the reduced emission factors for engine-out nucleation mode particles at any load. In addition, the low content of sulfate ash was considered the main influential factor for the low particle number emissions. © 2020 SAE International.

This study investigates the effect of environmental regulation on technological innovations based on the provincial panel data of industrial sectors in China during the years 2005–2015. The two-way fixed-effect panel data model is used to investigate the marginal and heterogeneous impacts empirically. Results indicate a U-shaped relationship between environmental regulation and technological innovations. In the short-term, environmental regulation has an “offsetting effect” on the research and innovation capacity of China's industrial sector. However, with the deepening of environmental regulation, it forces the industry to reduce the cost of pollution control by improving technological innovation capacity, thus creating a “compensation effect”. Results also show that environmental regulation policies changed the location and industry selection of foreign capital, which weakened the positive effect of FDI on technological innovations, indicating the “pollution shelter” effect. From the perspective of different types of enterprises, due to the higher cost of energy conservation and emission reduction, environmental regulation is detrimental to the technological innovations of state-owned enterprises. In particular, we find that industries with a higher degree of market competition and higher human capital investment tend to have stronger technological innovation capabilities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental regulation; FDI; Ownership structure; Technological innovations","Competition; Cost reduction; Emission control; Industrial research; Investments; Compensation effects; Human capital investments; Innovation capacity; Market competition; Ownership structure; State owned enterprise; Technological innovation; Technological innovation capability; Environmental regulations; environmental policy; foreign direct investment; innovation; panel data; pollution control; regulatory framework; technological development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078668122

In turn, this employment creation may be contingent upon the influence of some key factors, including technology learning, trade effects and policies and may affect different renewable energy technologies and activities of the renewable energy value chain in different ways. This paper estimates the gross employment stemming from the deployment of three renewable electricity technologies – photovoltaics (PV), wind on-shore and wind off-shore – up to 2050 for all Member States of the European Union. It uses a novel analytical methodology which is able to capture the influence of technology learning and internal and external trade. Additionally, it provides highly disaggregated results per activity in the supply chain (manufacturing, installation and O&M), year and country for different technology and policy scenarios. The results show that the employment created by those three technologies can be significant but considerable differences across technologies, activities and countries can be observed. In the analyzed period (2014–2050), most employment will be created in the PV sector, in the operation and maintenance activities and it will be highly geographically concentrated in a few countries. However, job creation will strongly depend on the scenarios and assumptions being made. In particular our findings suggest that the availability of carbon capture and storage will have a considerable influence on the number of jobs being created. In contrast, changes in other assumptions have limited effects on the results: a variable (vs. a constant) learning rate, more restrictive emissions targets by 2050 and higher PV costs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Employment factors; EU-JRC-TIMES; Job creation; Solar PV; Wind off-shore; Wind on-shore","Carbon capture; Employment; International trade; Solar energy; Supply chains; Analytical methodology; Job creation; Off-shore; Operation and maintenance; Renewable energy deployments; Renewable energy technologies; Socio-economic benefits; Solar PVs; Engineering education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078679299

In order to meet the limit imposed by the TA-Luft regulations on stationary engines, lean combustion represents a viable solution for achieving lower emissions as well as efficiency levels comparable with diesel engines. Leaner mixtures however affect the combustion stability as the flame propagation velocity and consequently heat release rate are slowed down. As a strategy to deliver higher ignition energy, an active pre-chamber may be used. This work focuses on assessing the performance of a pre-chamber combustion configuration in a stationary heavy-duty engine for power generation, operating at different loads, air-to-fuel ratios and spark timings. The engine was originally a 6-cylinder compression ignition engine which is here employed as a single cylinder engine and then suitably modified to host the pre-chamber (with its natural gas injection system and spark plug) with a new bowl piston to decrease compression ratio. A 0D model is built to make a thermodynamic analysis to characterize the local conditions in the pre-chamber before spark timing (temperature, pressure and composition), based on a compressible nozzle equation for the mass transfer between the chambers and a simplified Woschni model for the pre-chamber's heat transfer. A mathematical expression was found to describe the relationship between the local conditions and the early stage of the combustion.

Today, the world is confronted by many challenges related to climate change and natural-resource flows, including waste streams resulting from economic activity. The need for national and European environmental standards and the work of an environment monitoring authority to reduce air pollution are highlighted by economic and industrial activities. Thus, our research focused on determining if emissions of sulfur dioxide SO2 nitrogen NO2 and particulate matter 10 PM10 are influenced by planned and unplanned inspections made by competent authorities from Romania. We built a regression model that estimates the influence of economic measures imposed by the authorities on reducing industrial air pollution. Preliminary results showed that the number of inspections negatively influences air pollution, indicating that national and local authorities in Romania are striving to maintain air quality and are conducting more inspections when air pollution is high. © 2020 by the authors.

The geochemical nature and source–transport–fate of Pb in Nigeria’s environmental media are relatively unknown. This study was undertaken to quantify and characterize Pb in soils, sediments and road dusts from Lagos, Nigeria. A total of forty-eight soil samples, seventeen sediment samples and thirteen roadside soils were collected from within Lagos metropolis. The samples were air-dried, screened, pulverized and sieved through 63-µm nylon mesh. Mineralogical constituent of samples were determined using X-ray diffraction. The sieved fractions and pulverized rock samples were digested and analyzed for elemental Pb components using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The chemical fractionations of Pb in the samples were determined by sequential analysis. Lead isotope compositions of the samples were determined using quadrupole-based ICP-MS. Lead isotopic ratios and geo-accumulation indexes were used for discriminating and evaluating Pb sources. Quartz, microcline, K-feldspar, plagioclase and kaolinite were the preponderant minerals in powdered rocks, soils and sediments. The concentration (mg/kg) of elemental Pb in sediments and dusts for Lagos was 21-1963; 23-830 and 22-830, respectively. The plots (208Pb/207Pb)/(206Pb/207Pb) revealed that the Pb in the environmental media was derived from anthropogenic sources. The Pb isotopic ratios for soils, sediments and dusts were characterized by lower 208Pb/206Pb ratios, compared to bedrock. The Pb contents are held principally in the organic sulfide and reducible and carbonate phases. The Pb is held in very reactive geochemical phases, and these portend great risk to the environment and public health. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Pb isotopic ratio; Reducible and organic sulfide phases; Sequential analysis","concentration (composition); dust; environmental fate; inductively coupled plasma method; isotopic composition; isotopic ratio; lead; mineralogy; sediment pollution; soil pollution; Lagos [Lagos (STT)]; Lagos [Nigeria]; Nigeria; isotope; lead; Lead-206; Lead-207; chemistry; city; dust; environmental monitoring; Nigeria; procedures; sediment; soil; soil pollutant; Cities; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Isotopes; Lead; Nigeria; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066809559

The surface charge and charge transfer mechanism in a photocatalyst system govern the amount of products and their distribution. Herein, we used a wet impregnation method to embed Fe and Cr into the in-planes of porous boron-doped carbon nitride and tested the photoactivity by reducing CO2 gas in the presence of water at room temperature under visible-light illumination. The total consumed electron number, a measure for photoactivity, was increased by 2.14 times for Cr,B-codoped carbon nitride than that of the pristine graphitic carbon nitride. Also, the selectivity for CO was increased with transition metal doping. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that Fe existed in the +2 and +3 oxidation states; while Cr was in the +3 and +6 states. Notably, the optical and electronic properties were altered for the transition metal-doped catalysts. Several in situ measurements were performed to identify the reaction intermediates and underlying mechanism. COO- and HCHO were active intermediates for CO formation, and HCO3- could be an intermediate for CH4 generation. This work elucidates the pivotal role of trapped charge carriers in enhancing charge separation efficiencies and product selectivity. The results herein clearly demonstrate a promising strategy to use the strong p-d repulsion between metal and non-metal elements on a host photocatalyst to extend the visible-light absorption range and reduce the recombination events, which can enhance the selectivity and yields of products.

To foster green building construction in Malaysia, several strategies and sustainability metrics like the Malaysian Carbon Reduction and Environmental Sustainability Tool (MyCREST) have been established. Yet, the implementation of green office building development in Sarawak still remains low. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop MyCREST Embedded Framework (MEF) for enhancing the adoption of green office building construction in Sarawak. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the research aim, document analysis of the overarching MyCREST Reference Guide was conducted. Then, questionnaire was used to survey 120 green construction professionals in Kuching, the capital of Sarawak. Afterwards, data from the questionnaire was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science software version 22. As a result, the significant strategies for enhancing the adoption of green office building construction in Sarawak were identified, and ranked hierarchically using the Relative Importance Index. Findings: The established significant strategies include: government policies and incentives, sustainable technological practices, defined process for executing green building projects and adequate information for the public. Moreover, this study recommends MyCREST as the suitable Green Building Assessment Tool for developing green office buildings in Sarawak due to its integration of carbon reduction strategies with sustainability indicators. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to Kuching; hence future study should be extended to other cities in Sarawak. Originality/value: Based on the findings, the MEF is developed to enlighten the industry practitioners on the approaches that will elevate green office building development in Sarawak. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Green building; Green framework; Green technology; Malaysia; MyCREST; Sarawak",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073999376

However, this methane source might have been overestimated without considering high-affinity methanotrophs (HAMs; methane-oxidizing bacteria) recently identified in Arctic mineral soils4–7. Herein we find that integrating the dynamics of HAMs and methanogens into a biogeochemistry model8–10 that includes permafrost soil organic carbon dynamics3 leads to the upland methane sink doubling (~5.5 Tg CH4 yr−1) north of 50 °N in simulations from 2000–2016. The increase is equivalent to at least half of the difference in net methane emissions estimated between process-based models and observation-based inversions11,12, and the revised estimates better match site-level and regional observations5 , 7 , 13–15. The new model projects doubled wetland methane emissions between 2017–2100 due to more accessible permafrost carbon16–18. However, most of the increase in wetland emissions is offset by a concordant increase in the upland sink, leading to only an 18% increase in net methane emission (from 29 to 35 Tg CH4 yr−1). The projected net methane emissions may decrease further due to different physiological responses between HAMs and methanogens in response to increasing temperature19,20. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"biogenic emission; methane; microbial activity; oxidation; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082944696

It is necessary and important to examine empirical data on how Gwangju Metropolitan City has promoted its preemptive response to climate change. The concept of climate change, the status of climate change, and the energy consumption of each sector were first identified, and trends and prospects of changes in traffic conditions, and the status of parks and green spaces were examined using indicators from a 10 year period (2002–2011). Relevant variables were selected from the climate carbon map constituents presented in the ‘2030 Gwangju Metropolitan City Master Plan’ report, and key urban indicators and low-carbon indicators presented in ‘A Study on the Construction of Climate Carbon Map in Gwangju’. Cluster analysis using the factor scores of the factors extracted through these variables, followed by principal component analysis and k­medians nonhierarchical cluster analysis, were carried out using STATA 11.1. Thereafter, SWOT analysis was performed to classify the environmental factors (strengths and weaknesses) and external environmental factors (opportunities and threats) into categories based on the variables extracted from Gwangju Metropolitan City’s response to climate change.

However, phenology can vary at fine spatial scales, and these differences may be as important as long-term change from climate warming. We used high-frequency “PhenoCam” data to examine phenology of Spartina alterniflora, a foundation species native to salt marshes on the US East and Gulf coasts, and a common colonizer elsewhere. We examined phenology across three microhabitats from 2013 to 2017 and used this information to create the first spring green-up model for S. alterniflora. We then compared modern spatial variation to that exhibited over a 60-year climate record. Marsh interior plants initiated spring growth 17 days earlier than channel edge plants and spent 35 days more in the green-up phenophase and 25 days less in the maturity phenophase. The start of green-up varied by 17 days among 3 years. The best spring green-up model was based on winter soil total growing degree days. Across microhabitats, spring green-up differences were caused by small elevation changes (15 cm) that drove soil temperature variation of 0.8°C. Preliminary evidence indicated that high winter belowground biomass depletion triggered early green-up. Long-term change was similar: winter soil temperatures warmed 1.7 ± 0.3°C since 1958, and green-up advanced 11 ± 6 days, whereas contemporary microhabitat differences were 17 ± 4 days. Incorporating local spatial variation into plant phenology models may provide an early warning of climate vulnerability and improve understanding of ecosystem-scale productivity. Microscale phenology variation likely exists in other systems and has been unappreciated. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","coastal tidal marsh; digital camera imagery; Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER; global climate change; microhabitat; PhenoCam; soil temperature gradient; Spartina alterniflora; Sporobolus alterniflorus; spring green-up","belowground biomass; growth; long-term change; microhabitat; phenology; saltmarsh; soil temperature; spatial variation; temperature effect; temperature gradient; vulnerability; Gulf Coast [United States]; United States; Spartina alterniflora; Sporobolus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069002500

Investigating the relation between cardiovascular disease and exposure to a complex mixture of air pollutants requires holistic approaches. We assessed the relationship between exposure to multiple air pollutants and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in a general population sample. We collected data in the Lille MONICA registry (2008–2011) on 3268 incident cases (age range: 35–74). Based on 20 indicators, we derived a composite environmental score (SEnv) for cumulative exposure to air pollution. Poisson regression models were used to analyse associations between CHD rates on one hand and SEnv and each single indicator on the other (considered in tertiles, where T3 is the most contaminated). We adjusted models for age, sex, area-level social deprivation, and neighbourhood spatial structure. The incidence of CHD was a spatially heterogeneous (p=0.006). There was a significant positive association between SEnv and CHD incidence (trend p=0.0151). The relative risks [95%CI] of CHD were 1.08 [0.98–1.18] and 1.16 [1.04–1.29] for the 2nd and 3rd tertile of SEnv exposure. In the single pollutant analysis, PM10, NO2, cadmium, copper, nickel, and palladium were significantly associated with CHD rates. Multiple air pollution was associated with an increased risk of CHD. Single pollutants reflecting road traffic pollution were the most strongly associated with CHD. Our present results are consistent with the literature data on the impact of road traffic on the CHD risk in urban areas. © 2020","Cardiovascular disease; Composite index; Heavy metal; Multiple exposure; Traffic pollution","Air pollution; Cardiology; Heart; Heavy metals; Regression analysis; Roads and streets; Cardio-vascular disease; Composite index; Coronary heart disease; Cumulative exposures; Geographical variations; Multiple exposure; Poisson regression models; Traffic pollution; Diseases; heavy metal; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; health risk; heavy metal; pollution exposure; risk factor; traffic emission; urban area; air analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; biological monitoring; controlled study; coronary risk; environmental exposure; geographic distribution; health hazard; high risk population; human; human impact (environment); incidence; ischemic heart disease; long term exposure; neighborhood; priority journal; risk assessment; social isolation; traffic; urban area; adult; aged; air pollutant; coronary artery disease; environmental exposure; middle aged; particulate matter; France; Hauts-de-France; Lille; Nord [Hauts-de-France]; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Coronary Disease; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Incidence; Middle Aged; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078427552

These scenarios likely require significant land-use change. Failing to mitigate climate change will result in an unprecedented warming with significant biodiversity loss. The mitigation potential on land is high. However, how land-based mitigation options potentially affect biodiversity is poorly understood. Some land-based mitigation options could also counter the biodiversity loss. Here we reviewed the recently scientific literature to assess twenty land-based mitigation options that are implemented in different mitigation pathways to comply with the Paris Agreement for their biodiversity impacts by using the Mean Species Abundance (MSALU) indicator for land use. We showed the likely land-use transition and potential MSALU changes for each option, compared their carbon sequestration opportunities (tC per ha) and assessed the resulting biodiversity change in two case scenarios. Our results showed that most options benefit biodiversity. Reforestation of cultivated and managed areas together with restoration of wetlands deliver the largest MSALU increases, if land is allowed to reach a mature state over time. A quarter of the assessed options, including intensification of agricultural areas and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, decreased MSALU. Options, such as afforestation and reduced deforestation, either positively or negatively affected MSALU. This depends on their local implementation and adopted forest-conservation schemes. Comparing the different options showed that avoiding deforestation by implementing agroforestry at the expense of pastures delivered both the largest MSALU increases and the highest carbon sequestration opportunities. However, agroforestry that leads to deforestation, enhanced carbon sequestration slightly but with a marginal MSALU increase. This stresses the importance of avoiding forest conversion. Our study advances the understanding on current and future benefits and adverse effects of land-based mitigation options on biodiversity. This certainly helps biodiversity conservation and determines the regions with large land-based mitigation potential. © 2020","Biodiversity change; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Land-based mitigation","afforestation; agricultural land; agroforestry; Article; biodiversity; bioenergy; carbon sequestration; deforestation; ecosystem restoration; environmental protection; land use; priority journal; reforestation; wetland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078674441

While Tsurf drives many biophysical processes, air temperature (Ta) is an equally important target for climate mitigation and adaptation. Whether reductions in Tsurf translate to reductions in Ta remains complex, fraught by several nonlinear and intertwined processes. In particular, forest canopy structure strongly affects near-surface temperature gradients, complicating cross-site comparison. Here the influence of reforestation on Ta is assessed by targeting temperature metrics that are less sensitive to local canopy effects. Specifically, we consider the aerodynamic temperature (Taero), estimated using a novel procedure that does not rely on the assumptions of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, as well as the extrapolated temperature into the surface layer (Textrap). The approach is tested with flux tower data from a grass field, pine plantation, and mature hardwood stand co-located in the Duke Forest (North Carolina, USA). During growing season daytime periods, Tsurf is 4–6 °C cooler, and Taero and near-surface Textrap are 2–3 °C cooler, in the forests relative to the grassland. During the dormant season, daytime differences are smaller but still substantial. At night, differences in Taero are small, and near-surface Textrap is warmer over forests than grasslands during the growing season (by 0.5 to 1 °C). Finally, the influence of land cover on Textrap at the interface between the surface and mixed layer is small. Overall, reforestation appears to provide a meaningful opportunity for adaption to warmer daytime Ta in the southeastern United States, especially during the growing season. ©2020.

For this purpose, many research efforts are being devoted to the development of a new generation of high-performance spark-ignition (SI) engines for passenger car applications. Particularly, the PC ignition concept, also known as Turbulent Jet Ignition (TJI), is the focus of several investigations for its benefits in terms of engine thermal efficiency. The passive or un-scavenged version of this ignition strategy does not require an auxiliary fuel supply inside the PC; therefore, it becomes a promising solution for passenger car applications as packaging and installation are simple and straightforward. Moreover, combining this concept with lean burn is an interesting alternative for both improving the engine efficiency and maintaining low pollutant emissions as it enables Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) which ultimately reduces NOX emissions. EGR dilution is also an attractive approach as it is compatible with the three-way catalyst for NOX control. However, previous researches focused on developing the technology rather than understanding the governing physical phenomena. Consequently, the knowledge about the characteristics and limitations of the combustion process for this ignition concept is still limited. For this purpose, an experimental campaign combined with a computational study was performed in this research work to analyze the TJI combustion features in a turbocharged passenger car-size single-cylinder SI engine, sweeping EGR and λ levels. Single-cycle RANS simulations were carried out following a suitable methodology and the results were validated against experimental data keeping the same engine configuration and operating conditions. The simulation results were used to study in detail the combustion process and jet characteristics. The analysis of the results provided a detailed insight about the key aspects limiting the passive PC ignition concept compatibility with air/EGR dilution. © 2020 SAE International.

One approach is physisorption on very high surface area materials incorporating metal atoms. Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are a promising material for this application as their behaviour is largely independent of the nanoscopic physical features providing a greater degree of tolerance in their synthesis. Aluminum doping has been shown to be a promising approach for carbon nanotubes but has been underexplored for BNNTs. Using first principles density functional theory, the energetics, electronics and structural impacts of aluminum adsorption to both zigzag and armchair polymorphs of BNNTs was investigated along with their potential capacity to adsorb hydrogen. The fine atomic structural and electronic details of these interactions is discussed.

A transported PDF method is used to close properly the soot-production turbulence interaction and the emission Turbulence Radiation Interaction (TRI). A Narrow-Band CK (NBCK) model is used as the gas radiative property model. The absorption TRI is neglected based on the Optically-Thin Fluctuation Approximation (OTFA). In accordance with a previous study dealing with non-sooting hydrogen flames (Nmira et al., JQSRT 220 (2018) 172–179), the 3-atm and 4-atm flames are designed from the atmospheric flame by using a Froude modeling approach that allows to preserve the flame/flow structure as the pressure is increased and hence to isolate the pressure effects on soot production, radiative heat transfer, and TRI. The effects of increasing pressure on radiant fraction result from two competing mechanisms: i) an increase in soot emission that tends to increase the radiant fraction and ii) a reduction in flame transparency that tends to reduce it. For the present flames, the first mechanism dominates the second, resulting in an increased radiant fraction with increasing the pressure. The TRI effects on flame radiative loss are also governed by competing mechanisms. The enhancement mechanism is due to gas emission TRI and temperature self-correlation effects on soot emission whereas the reduction mechanism is caused by the negative correlation between soot volume fraction and temperature. The former dominates whereas the latter becomes increasingly important with increasing the pressure. This limits the increase in the global radiative loss due to TRI as the pressure is increased. In addition, numerical simulations show that the TRI effects can reduce the local radiative loss in regions of high soot concentration of the 4 atm flame. © 2020","Methane turbulent jet diffusion flame; Pressure effects; Radiative loss; Turbulence-radiation interaction","Atmospheric structure; Combustion; Dust; High pressure effects; Methane; Pressure effects; Radiation effects; Radiative transfer; Soot; Turbulence; Gas radiative properties; Radiative heat transfer; Radiative loss; Turbulence interactions; Turbulence Radiation Interaction (TRI); Turbulence-radiation interaction; Turbulent diffusion flame; Turbulent jet; Heat transfer; diffusion; heat transfer; jet; methane; pressure effect; radiative transfer; turbulent flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079696348

The accuracy of conventional bottom-up approaches to estimate aerosol emissions depends on the degree to which various influencing parameters are estimated. The availability of satellite observations not only enhances the capability of determining various influencing parameters, but also provides alternate ways of assessing aerosol sources. The present study employs a Lagrangian approach to the Advection Diffusion Equation (ADE) to estimate the transported aerosols and hence the Aerosol Source Strength (ASS) using satellite-measured Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and reanalysis wind data. This top-down approach is based on the advection and diffusion of atmospheric aerosols considering wind circulation and atmospheric conditions rather than using indicative parameters. ASS was computed every 3 hr at a 0.25°×0.25° grid across California during July 2018. For the computation, AOD retrievals were obtained from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-16 with observations every 15 min. The data were resampled to the grid every 3 hr, and backward trajectories were run at every gridpoint to ascertain the initial aerosol concentration for the ADE. The final aerosol concentrations obtained from the ADE model were then compared with the observed AOD to obtain the ASS during that time period. The results are indicative of higher ASS around wildfire locations. The ASS values also show good correlation (R2=0.886) with Fire Radiative Power (FRP) obtained from Terra MODIS fire product. The method was further applied to investigate the spatial correlation of ASS with power plant density, which reveals a steady increase in ASS with power plant density (R2=0.82). © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","aerosol emissions; California; GOES-16; wildfire","Advection; Air quality; Fires; Geostationary satellites; Lagrange multipliers; Power plants; Advection and diffusions; Advection-diffusion equation; Aerosol emissions; California; Geostationary operational environmental satellites; GOES-16; La-grangian approaches; wildfire; Atmospheric aerosols; advection-diffusion equation; aerosol; correlation; GOES; optical depth; source apportionment; top-down approach; wildfire; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086009887

Green infrastructure goes well beyond the presence of green space and refers more to a strategically planned network of natural and seminatural areas, with other environmental features designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and possibly to improve human health. In this narrative review, we found that small green infrastructure, such as green roofs and walls, has the potential to mitigate urban flooding, attenuate indoor temperatures and heat islands, improve air quality, and muffle noise, among other benefits, but these effects have not been linked directly to health. Larger green infrastructure has been associated with reduced temperatures, air pollution, and crimes and violence, but less so with health, although some evidence suggests that it may be beneficial for health (e.g., good health, decreased mortality). Finally, parks and street trees show many health benefits, but it is not clear if they can always be considered green infrastructure. © 2020 Annual Reviews Inc..

Comparisons with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets indicate that both the CMIP5 and CMIP6 versions of the BCC model can simulate the warm and cold extremes of monthly air and land surface temperatures reasonably well for the period of 1979–2005. Compared with reanalyses, the CMIP6 version has better consistencies in the magnitudes, narrower spreads of zonal extremes, and smaller root mean square errors (RMSEs) than the CMIP5 version due to an update with a new cloud fraction scheme and a snow-albedo scheme. When the annual climatological cycle is removed, the CMIP6 version performs better than the CMIP5 version on the interannual variability of both warm and cold extremes. Changes in the air and land surface temperature extremes for the CMIP6 version are more similar to the reanalyses. We found that the warming rates of both warm and cold extremes at regional scales are significantly higher than the global averaged warming rate of surface temperatures, especially at the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, which is consistent with the previous studies on monthly mean air temperature. Further, both the BCC models and reanalyses show that the cold extremes warm faster than the warm extremes, and the land surface temperature extremes warm more quickly than the air temperature extremes during this period. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"air quality; CMIP; comparative study; computer simulation; extreme event; land surface; surface temperature; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078329336

Since pre-industrial times, the globally averaged dry mole fraction of methane in the atmosphere has increased considerably. Emissions from coal mining are one of the primary anthropogenic methane sources. However, our knowledge about different sources and sinks of methane is still subject to great uncertainties. Comprehensive measurement campaigns and reliable chemistry-climate models, are required to fully understand the global methane budget and to further develop future climate mitigation strategies. The CoMet 1.0 campaign (May to June 2018) combined airborne in situ, as well as passive and active remote sensing measurements to quantify the emissions from coal mining in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB, Poland). Roughly 502&thinsp;kt of methane is emitted from the ventilation shafts per year. In order to help with the flight planning during the campaigns, we performed 6&thinsp;d forecasts using the online coupled, three-Time nested global and regional chemistry-climate model MECO(n). We applied three-nested COSMO/MESSy instances going down to a spatial resolution of 2.8&thinsp;km over the USCB. The nested global-regional model system allows for the separation of local emission contributions from fluctuations in the background methane. Here, we introduce the forecast set-up and assess the impact of the model's spatial resolution on the simulation of methane plumes from the ventilation shafts. Uncertainties in simulated methane mixing ratios are estimated by comparing different airborne measurements to the simulations. Results show that MECO(3) is able to simulate the observed methane plumes and the large-scale patterns (including vertically integrated values) reasonably well. Furthermore, we obtain reasonable forecast results up to forecast day four. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

While households as agents of change increasingly become a crucial element in energy transitions, bottom-up mechanisms facilitating behavioral change are not fully understood. A scientific understanding of individual energy use, requires eliciting factors that trigger or inhibit changes in energy behavior. This paper explores individual energy consumption practices and behavioral aspects that affect them. We quantitatively study the determinants of three energy actions: (1) investments in house insulation, solar panels and/or energy-efficient appliances, (2) conservation of energy by changing energy-use habits like switching off unused devices or adjusting house temperature, and (3) switching to green(er) electricity sources. To address this goal, we conduct a comprehensive survey among households (N = 1790) in two EU regions: Overijssel, the Netherlands and Navarre, Spain. We use probit regression to estimate how behavioral factors, households’ socioeconomic characteristics and structural attributes of dwellings influence energy related actions. Our analysis demonstrates that awareness and personal and social norms are as important as monetary factors. Moreover, education and structural dwelling factors significantly affect households’ actions. These results have implications for governmental policies aimed at reducing residential CO2 footprints and facilitating demand-side solutions in a transition to low-carbon economy. © 2019 The Authors","Awareness; Energy-efficiency; Low-carbon economy; Personal norms; Policy implication; Probit regression; Residential energy demand; Survey",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075501100

Much attention has been paid to the species diversity of copepods worldwide, but the phylogeography and genetic diversity of copepods in Nigeria is unexplored. Results: Using a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I marker, we preformed phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses for Cyclopidae copepods in Southeast Nigeria. A high species diversity of Cyclopidae in Nigeria: 5 species of Tropocyclops, 5 species of Mesocyclops and 2 species of Thermocyclops from Cyclopidae were identified in 15 populations. Moreover, we detected 18 unique haplotypes, which fell into two distinct clades. Pairwise genetic distances (uncorrected p-distances) among the species of Cyclopidae ranged from 0.05 to 0.257. Several species co-existed in the same lake, and some haplotypes were shared among different geographic populations, suggesting a dispersal of Cyclopidae in our sampling region. Finally, we found that the population genetic diversity for each species of Cyclopidae was low in Nigeria. Conclusions: Our findings explored the species diversity and distribution of copepods within the family Cyclopidae for 15 Nigerian freshwater ecosystems: a high species diversity of Cyclopidae copepods was detected over a small geographic sampling range.

Previous studies have shown the increases in the C stocks with increasing invasive plants, but these results remain contentious. Soil microbial communities are usually altered by plant invasion, which potentially influences the C cycling underground. We hypothesized that the plant invasion-caused dynamic changes in soil microbes would lead to the corresponding change in soil C accumulation. Using greenhouse experiments we simulated different invader intensities through varying the relative abundance of invasive species Mikania micrantha and its co-occurring native species Paederia scandens. By analyzing 13C-phospholipid fatty acid we found the invasive M. micrantha assimilated more 13C and transferred faster the fixed 13C through different tissues to soils, as compared to native P. scandens. Soil microbial components, i.e., i15:0, 16:0, 10Me16:0, 18:1w9c and 18:2w6,9 were mainly using the photo-assimilated 13C. In addition, we found a hump-shaped relationship between soil net 13C accumulate rate and rhizosphere microbial biomass, indicating that the soil C accumulation may be either enhanced or reduced in invaded ecosystems, depending on microbe abundance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","13C-phospholipid fatty acid analysis; Carbon utilization; Mikania micrantha; Plant invasion; Soil microbial community","Bacteria; Carbon; Ecosystems; Fatty acids; Phospholipids; Carbon utilization; Mikania micrantha; Phospholipid fatty acid analysis; Plant invasion; Soil microbial community; Soils; carbon 13; fatty acid; carbon; carbon cycle; carbon storage; fatty acid; invasibility; lipid; microbial community; soil carbon; soil microorganism; Article; bioaccumulation; controlled study; greenhouse gas; invasive species; microbial community; Mikania; Mikania micra; nonhuman; population abundance; priority journal; simulation; soil chemistry; soil microflora; species invasion; transport and binding phenomena; introduced species; microbiology; microflora; Mikania; soil; Mikania micrantha; Paederia scandens; Carbon; Introduced Species; Microbiota; Mikania; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076228033

In this study, an advanced online coupled Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was applied to the Continental Southeast Asia. The targets were to investigate the impacts of projected change in future anthropogenic emissions and its impacts in combination with climate change impacts on future particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) air quality. Future anthropogenic emissions were produced by scaling Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP) emissions in year 2010 using ratios taken from the Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants (ECLIPSE) emission database in year 2050 and 2010 under current legislation (CLE) scenario. Future climate projections were obtained by implementing a dynamical downscaling method based on pseudo global warming (PGW) technique using future (2046-2055) climate conditions and present (2006-2015) climate conditions provided by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Experiment (CMIP5) Community Earth System Model (CESM) data and the 2014 meteorological conditions. Two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) climate scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, were considered. Overall, anthropogenic emission change alone appears to cause higher PM2.5 and O3 levels in future period. Across four target countries namely Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, on average, PM2.5 and O3 concentrations increase by +4.56 μg/m3 (+13.76%) and +5.12 ppb (+13.20%) during the dry season, +3.03 μg/m3 (+27.72%) and +5.89 ppb (+23.97%) during the wet season, respectively. PM2.5 increase is attributed to the emission growth of primary PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors. Among PM2.5 species, while raising trend was mainly predicted for anthropogenic secondary organic aerosol (PM2.5 ASOA), sulfate ion (PM2.5 SO42−), nitrate ion (PM2.5 NO3−), and ammonium ion (PM2.5 NH4+) concentrations, reducing trend was mainly predicted for element carbon (PM2.5 EC) and primary organic aerosol (PM2.5 POA) concentrations due to the projected primary PM2.5 emission decrease in China. O3 increase is driven by high nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission increase rather than non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) emission increase since NOx-limited regime mostly dominates over the region. Both future PM2.5 and O3 increases in Continental Southeast Asia are also contributed by pollutant emission growth in India. Driven by climate change and emission change in combination, the rise in PM2.5 and O3 concentrations is larger in RCP8.5 scenario than that in RCP4.5 scenario. Averagely, under RCP4.5 scenario, PM2.5 and O3 concentrations, across four target countries, were projected to increase by +3.43 μg/m3 (+10.36%) and +4.37 ppb (+11.27%) during the dry season, +2.20 μg/m3 (+20.15%) and +5.20 ppb (+21.16%) during the wet season. Under RCP8.5 scenario, they increase by +7.10 μg/m3 (+21.43%) and +6.35 ppb (+16.38%) during the dry season, +3.08 μg/m3 (+28.15%) and +6.20 ppb (+25.20%) during the wet season, respectively. The simulation results indicated that emission trend is a major factor in the variation in PM2.5 and O3 concentrations, while the climate change also plays an important role. Current legislations and pollution controls as in ECLIPSE CLE scenario are inadequate for better PM2.5 and O3 air quality in the region. A stronger emission control strategy will be required to cope with this PM2.5 and O3 air quality degradation, particularly under RCP8.5 scenario. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change impacts; Continental Southeast Asia; Fine particulate matter; Future emissions; online coupled WRF-CMAQ model; Ozone","Aerosols; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Drought; Emission control; Global warming; Ions; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Quality control; Sulfur compounds; Volatile organic compounds; Weather forecasting; Climate change impact; Cmaq models; Community multi-scale air qualities; Fine particulate matter; Non-methane volatile organic compounds; Secondary organic aerosols; Southeast Asia; Weather research and forecasting; Climate models; ammonia; carbon; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; ozone; sulfate; volatile organic compound; aerodynamics; air quality; ammonium; anthropogenic effect; assessment method; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; CMIP; concentration (composition); future prospect; numerical method; ozone; particle size; particulate matter; pollutant transport; prediction; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; Article; Cambodia; climate change; concentration ratio; dry season; environmental policy; greenhouse effect; India; Laos; particulate matter; priority journal; rainy season; secondary organic aerosol; Southeast Asia; Thailand; Viet Nam; Cambodia; China; India; Laos; Thailand; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081253254

We propose a research model that distinguishes between vulnerability and severity components of perceived risks, and adds perceived adaptive capacity as a third factor to predict the intention to take adaptive measures. We used this combined model as a conceptual lens for an explorative survey among 1086 residents of coastal and delta communities in Vietnam. Pairwise analyses revealed a significant association of flood and climate change risk perceptions with individual’s flood experience, climate change knowledge, frequency of community participation and socio-demographic factors. However, in multivariate analysis, the influence of most socio-demographic factors became weak or patchy. Flood experience was the most influential driver of flood-related risk perceptions but weak for climate change-related risk perceptions and behavioural intentions. Knowledge strongly increased the intention to adapt to flood and climate risks and the perceived vulnerability to and severity of climate change risks, but reduced the perceived capacity to adapt to climate risks. Frequency of community participation increased the perceived vulnerability and severity of climate change risks, the intention to adapt to both climate and flood risks and the perceived capacity to adapt to flood risks, but reduced the perceived capacity to adapt to climate risks. Our research confirms earlier findings that individuals’ knowledge, place-specific experience and social-cultural influences are key predictors of both flood and climate change risk perceptions and intentions to take adaptive measures. These factors should therefore receive ample attention in climate risk communication. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The UHF quantifies the urban warming at any location in the spatio-temporal domain due to different effects, such as anthropogenic effects and climatic effects. These effects can be controlled and configured by our modelling approach, thus allowing the evaluation of different scenarios of interest. We first provide a definition of UHF followed by definitions of the Anthropogenic Effects (AE) components. Then, based on those definitions, we define the fundamental quantity of UHF spatial-temporal stochastic (random) processes. Next, we propose several metrics for quantifying and summarising the UHF, which are statistical estimators. These provide insightful summaries of the population parameters of the UHF stochastic process, and can be easily calculated in practice. To illustrate how our framework can be used, we utilise a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and provide detailed examples of various UHF metrics, based on real data of Singapore. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Anthropogenic effects; Climate model; Urban Heat Footprint (UHF)","climate modeling; heat island; numerical model; quantitative analysis; statistical analysis; urban climate; warming; weather forecasting; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077886951

However, technological issues to be resolved are still identifiable and should be of concern, particularly in terms of internal mass transfer. If sufficient liquid-to-gas H2 mass transfer rates are not ensured, serious problems associated with the recovery of biohydrogen and consequent inhibition of the process can occur. Therefore, the continuous and effective removal of H2 gas is required, which can be performed using gas separation membranes. In this review, we aim to analyze the literature experiences and knowledge regarding mass transfer enhancement approaches and show how membranes may contribute to this task by simultaneously processing the internal (headspace) gas, consisting mainly of H2 and CO2. Promising strategies related to biogas recirculation and integrated schemes using membranes will be presented and discussed to detect potential future research directions for improving biohydrogen technology. © 2020 The Author(s)","Biogas recirculation; Biohydrogen; CO2 utilization; Mass transfer; Membrane separation; Process integration","Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Gas industry; Gases; Hydrogen production; Mass transfer; Bio-hydrogen; Bio-hydrogen production; Biogas recirculation; Future research directions; Gas separation membrane; Mass transfer enhancement; Membrane separation; Process integration; Gas permeable membranes; biogas; carbon dioxide; hydrogen; biofuel; biogas; fermentation; hydrogen; inhibition; mass transfer; separation; anaerobic fermentation; fermentation; membrane technology; membrane transport; microbial community; partial pressure; priority journal; scale up; fermentation; Biofuels; Fermentation; Hydrogen",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078320930

The Stage 1 program focused on achieving the ULN levels on the heavy-duty regulatory cycles utilizing a turbo-compound engine which required the integration of novel catalyst technologies and a supplemental heat source. While the aftertreatment configuration provided a potential solution to meet the ULN target, a complicated approach with a greenhouse gas (GHG) penalty was required to overcome challenges from low temperature exhaust. A subsequent Stage 2 program was concerned with the development of a new low load test cycle and evaluating the trade-off between GHG and tailpipe NOX on the Stage 1 ULN solution. The current Stage 3 program focuses on both the regulatory cycles and the new low load cycle, but leverages a different engine architecture that is more representative of the broader heavy-duty industry to meet the Phase 2 GHG regulations and to simplify the ULN aftertreatment solution. Aftertreatment thermal management is a key aspect of achieving ULN on both the regulatory cycles and the low load cycle. Therefore, a more aggressive engine calibration was developed on the Stage 3 platform using the available engine actuators for aftertreatment heat up and thermal management. This modified calibration was then used to evaluate additional hardware technologies under steady-state and transient operation to assess the trade-offs between exhaust gas characteristics, emissions, and fuel consumption. A simple ranking system was applied to the transient results and with cylinder deactivation being selected to carry forward into the subsequent tasks of the Stage 3 ULN program. © 2020 SAE International.

We identify counties with tens to hundreds of avoided ozone-related asthma ED visits under RCP4.5 versus RCP8.5.

The objective of this study was to conduct a cradle-to-farm gate environmental impact analysis and resource inventory of the California dairy production system to estimate the change in greenhouse gas emissions and water and land use over the 50-yr period between 1964 and 2014. Using a life cycle assessment according to international standards and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations guidelines, we analyzed contributions from dairy production in California to global environmental change. Production of 1 kg of energy- and protein-corrected milk (ECM) in California emitted 1.12 to 1.16 kg of CO2 equivalents (CO2e) in 2014 compared with 2.11 kg of CO2e in 1964, a reduction of 45.0 to 46.9% over the last 50 yr, depending on the model used. Greater reductions in enteric methane intensity (i.e., methane production per kilogram of ECM) were observed (reduction of 54.1 to 55.7%) compared with manure GHG (reduction of 8.73 to 11.9%) in 2014 compared with 1964. This was mainly because manure management in the state relies on lagoons for storage, which has a greater methane conversion factor than solid manure storage. Water use intensity was reduced by 88.1 to 89.9%, with water reductions of 88.7 to 90.5% in crop production, 55.3 to 59.2% in housing and milking, and 52.4 to 54% in free water intake. Improved crop genetics and management have contributed to large efficiencies in water utilization. Land requirements for crop production were reduced by 89.4 to 89.7% in 2014 compared with 1964. This was mainly due to dramatic increases in crop yields in the last 50 yr. The increases in milk production per cow through genetic improvements and better nutrition and animal care have contributed to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and land and water usage when calculated per unit of production (intensity) basis. © 2020 American Dairy Science Association","dairy; environment; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment","methane; water; agricultural land; animal; animal food; animal husbandry; biosynthesis; bovine; California; classification; crop; crop production; dairying; environment; female; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; growth, development and aging; manure; metabolism; milk; pregnancy; waste management; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animals; California; Cattle; Crop Production; Crops, Agricultural; Dairying; Environment; Farms; Female; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gases; Manure; Methane; Milk; Pregnancy; Waste Management; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079073242

The chronologies cover the period between 1876 and 2012 and integrate data from four individual trees from the Calimani Mts in the eastern Carpathians where climatic records are scarce and starts only from 1961. Calibration trials show that the δ13C values correlate with local April–May relative humidity and with regional to larger scale (European) summer precipitation. δ18O correlates significantly with local relative humidity, cloud cover, maximum temperature, as well as European scale drought conditions. In all cases, the climate effects on δ13C values are weaker than those recorded in the δ18O data, with the latter revealing a tendency toward higher (lower) values of δ18O during extremely dry (wet) years. The most striking signal, however, is the strong link between the interannual δ18O variability recorded in the Calimani Mts and large-scale circulation patterns associated with North Atlantic and Mediteraneean Sea sea surface temperatures. High (low) values of δ18O occur in association with a high (low) pressure system over the central and eastern part of Europe and with a significantly warmer (colder) Mediterranean Sea surface temperature. These results demonstrate the possibility of using tree ring oxygen isotopes from the eastern Carpathians to reconstruct regional drought conditions in eastern Europe on long-term time scales and larger scale circulation dynamics over the preinstrumental periods. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","atmospheric circulation; climate response; dendrochronology; Swiss stone pine; δ13C; δ18O","Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon; Climatology; Drought; Isotopes; Oceanography; Oxygen; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Trees (mathematics); Atmospheric circulation; Carbon and oxygen isotopes; Climate response; dendrochronology; Large-scale circulation patterns; Sea surface temperature (SST); Stone pine; Summer precipitation; Forestry; atmospheric circulation; carbon isotope; cellulose; climate effect; dendrochronology; drought; isotopic ratio; oxygen isotope; precipitation (climatology); relative humidity; sea surface temperature; stable isotope; tree ring; Carbon; Drought; Isotopes; Meteorology; Oceanography; Temperature; Calimani Mountains; Carpathians; Romania; Pinus cembra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074793257

Although such a time-invariant framework is appropriate for binary systems, in ternary Fe–C–Mn alloys, particularly in the three-phase regime, a characteristic non-stationary equilibrium condition results in the formation of a unique microstructure, called ‘divergent pearlite’. In the present work, the isothermal growth of the divergent pearlite, under different transformation temperatures; 605∘C, 625∘C and 650∘C, is investigated by adopting a phase-field approach which establishes local-equilibrium (LE) condition across the interface. Though most theoretical approaches intend to setup such condition, the current numerical technique elegantly recovers the non-stationary partitioning equilibrium (P-LE). The thermodynamical framework, which dictates this unique equilibrium condition, is introduced by incorporating the CALPHAD-based data. In addition to rendering the microstructure which is consistent with the observed divergent pearlite, the factors governing the characteristic kinetics and phase distributions are analysed. In complete agreement with the existing studies, it is recognised that the non-steady-state growth is induced by a proportional decrease in the matrix carbon-content, which reduces the transformation kinetics, by influencing the Mn partitioning driving force. The characteristic proportionality which exists between these governing factors is unravelled in the current investigation. Moreover, it is also identified that the transition from the non-steady-state evolution in three-phase regime to predominantly steady state in two-phase regime is continuous. In other words, at higher undercooling, a resolvable segment of time-invariant growth is observed in the initial stages, which is subsequently followed by the divergent evolution. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Growth kinetics; Linear transformations; Manganese alloys; Manganese steel; Microstructure; Pearlite; Divergent evolution; Equilibrium conditions; Eutectoid decomposition; Numerical techniques; Phase-field approaches; Theoretical approach; Transformation kinetics; Transformation temperatures; Pearlitic transformations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077560309

Design/methodology/approach: The by-production approach is used in conjunction with data from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) of India to compute the output-based Färe, Grosskopf, Lovell (FGL) efficiency index and its decomposition into productive and environmental efficiency indexes for the ITPPs Findings: The authors show that given the aggregated nature of data on coal reported by CEA, CEA’s computation of CO2 emissions through a deterministic linear formula that does not distinguish between different coal types and the tiny share of oil in coal-based power plants, the computed output-based environmental efficiency indexes are no longer informative. Meaningful measurement of environmental efficiency using CEA data is possible only along the dimension of the coal input. Productive efficiency is positively associated with the engineering concept of thermodynamic/energy efficiency and is also high for power plants with high operating availabilities reflecting better management and O&amp;M practices. Both these factors are high for private and centrally owned as opposed to state-owned power-generating companies. The example of Sipat demonstrates the importance of (ultra)supercritical technologies in increasing productive and thermodynamic efficiencies of the ITPPs, while also reducing CO2 emitted per unit of the net electricity generated. Originality/value: This paper uses the by-production approach for the first time to measure technical efficiency of ITPPs and highlights how the nature of the Indian data impacts on efficiency measurement. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","By-production technologies; Coal-based Indian thermal power plants; Emission-generating technologies; environmental and technical efficiency indexes; Output-based measurement of productive",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068158368

Despite increasing number of studies on this topic, our knowledge on importance of genetic differentiation, plasticity and their interactions along larger sets of species is still limited especially for traits related to plant ecophysiology. We studied variation in traits related to growth, leaf chemistry, contents of photosynthetic pigments and activity of antioxidative enzymes, stomata morphology and photosynthetic activity across eight Impatiens species growing along altitudinal gradients in Himalayas cultivated in three different temperature regimes and explored effects of among species phylogenetic relationships on the results. Original and target climatic conditions determine trait values in our system. The traits are either highly plastic (e.g., APX, CAT, plant size, neoxanthin, β-carotene, chlorophyll a/b, DEPSC) or are highly differentiated among populations (stomata density, lutein production). Many traits show strong among population differentiation in degree of plasticity and direction in response to environmental changes. Most traits indicate that the species will profit from the expected warming. This suggests that different processes determine the values of the different traits and separating the importance of genetic differentiation and plasticity is crucial for our ability to predict species response to future climate changes. The results also indicate that evolution of the traits is not phylogenetically constrained but including phylogenetic information into the analysis may improve our understanding of the trait-environment relationships as was apparent from the analysis of SLA. © Copyright © 2020 Münzbergová, Kosová, Schnáblová, Rokaya, Synková, Haisel, Wilhelmová and Dostálek.","antioxidants; Balsaminaceae; carotenoids; elevational gradients; genotype × environment interaction; growth chamber experiment; phylogenetic constrains; xanthophyll cycle",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083519149

Additionally, optimizing messaging for communicating CC and encouraging greater mitigation behavior can yield significant benefits to global stakeholders. Here we evaluated the effectiveness of informative, persuasive and empathic message frames about a major climate-related local flooding event through online surveys administered to 370 adults in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada and 360 adults in Queensland, Australia. Measures of trust in climate communicators and climate science, concern over CC effects, and belief that most recent floods are due to CC were assessed before and after message exposure, along with related values, beliefs and emotions. Willingness to support pro-environmental groups was assessed as a proxy measure of behavioural intent. Cumulative odds ordinal regression and multinomial regression were used to predict group membership (no support, passive support, active support). Political affiliation, trust and belief in CC, belief in anthropogenic CC, pro-environmental values, and, in some regressions, previous flood exposure, were significant predictors of activism support. Respondents who received the empathic message frame and had low to medium pro-environmental values were more likely to believe the link between flooding and CC compared to those who received the informative message frame. These results, including the finding that some elicited emotions predicted behavioral intent, provide insight into how to construct climate information for groups with varying beliefs, values and experiences, to reduce climate skepticism and encourage pro-environmental behavior. © 2020 The Author(s).

It is a complex issue, which cuts across the environmental, social, economic, and political dimensions. Despite recent investments and technological improvements to capture sulphur dioxide emissions and minimize the discharge of mine effluents into natural streams, there are still numerous reports that cite air and water pollution problems. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sulphur dioxide emissions and mine effluent discharge on air and water quality in Kankoyo Township of Mufulira district. The investigation involved sampling of the ambient air, mine effluents, and domestic water and determination of sulphur dioxide and various water quality parameters. The results indicated significant improvements in sulphur dioxide capture and subsequent reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions from the copper smelter. The average sulphur capture was 48% from 2007 to 2013 and about 94% from 2014 to 2018. However, the average annual sulphur dioxide level for 2017/2018 was 144.5 μg/m3per 24 hours, which is 15.6% above the statutory limit of 125 μg/m3 in ambient air. The general water quality meets the statutory limits, despite the fact that the water quality in this area may be affected not only by the mining activities, but also by the dilapidated water infrastructure, which may be a further source of contamination from intrusion by surface run-off and sewage leakage. © 2020 South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

Despite its great abundance on earth, the accessibility for microorganisms is often limited, because poorly soluble ferric iron (Fe3+) is the predominant oxidation state in an aerobic environment. Hence, the reduction of Fe3+ is of essential importance to meet the cellular demand of ferrous iron (Fe2+) but might become detrimental as excessive amounts of intracellular Fe2+ tend to undergo the cytotoxic Fenton reaction in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. We demonstrate that the complex formation rate of Fe3+ and phenolic compounds like protocatechuic acid was increased by 46% in the presence of HCO3 - and thus accelerated the subsequent redox reaction, yielding reduced Fe2+. Consequently, elevated CO2/HCO3 - levels increased the intracellular Fe2+ availability, which resulted in at least 50% higher biomass-specific fluorescence of a DtxR-based Corynebacterium glutamicum reporter strain, and stimulated growth. Since the increased Fe2+ availability was attributed to the interaction of HCO3 - and chemical iron reduction, the abiotic effect postulated in this study is of general relevance in geochemical and biological environments. IMPORTANCE In an oxygenic environment, poorly soluble Fe3+ must be reduced to meet the cellular Fe2+ demand. This study demonstrates that elevated CO2/HCO3 - levels accelerate chemical Fe3+ reduction through phenolic compounds, thus increasing intracellular Fe2+ availability. A number of biological environments are characterized by the presence of phenolic compounds and elevated HCO3 - levels and include soil habitats and the human body.

The alkalinity increases initially approximately in proportion to nitrate (NO3 −) concentration and eventually approaches an apparent maximum of approximately 8 mmol L−1 at high NO3 − concentrations. This close positive relationship between alkalinity and NO3 − concentration appears to be predominantly a result of three processes: (i) mineralization of organic nitrogen fertilizer, (ii) exchange of OH− and H+ during the uptake of NO3 − or ammonium by crop plants, and (iii) CO2 released by roots as a result of fertilizer-stimulated plant growth. We suggest that the asymptotic approach to a maximum groundwater alkalinity at NO3 − concentrations exceeding 0.25 mmol L−1 may be caused by (i) a maximum possible areal crop production at excessive N fertilization and (ii) an increasing CO2 loss to the atmosphere due to the increasing CO2 production in the soil. Our analysis provides a general understanding and quantitative prediction of steady-state groundwater NO3 − concentration, alkalinity, pH, the degree of CO2 supersaturation in the soil, and soil CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. The positive correlation between alkalinity and NO3 − concentration observed in groundwaters persists in rivers and lakes. We conclude that an economically efficient agricultural practice that avoids over-fertilization might accelerate the in-soil carbonate weathering rate up to approximately threefold compared to unfertilized soils, but it will not jeopardize the use of aquifers for drinking water. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agriculture; Alkalinity; Groundwater; Nitrogen fertilizer; Surface waters; Switzerland","alkalinity; carbonate; fertilizer; groundwater; nitrogen; surface water; translocation; watershed; weathering; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081600687

The results confirmed an inverted U-shaped relationship between urbanization and CO2 emissions only in high income group, which is consistent with the theory of ecological modernization. EKC (Environmental Kuznets Curve) hypothesis is confirmed only in upper-middle and high income groups. Foreign direct investment increased CO2 emissions, which supports “pollution haven” hypothesis.

This study uses state level data to examine fossil fuel (coal and natural gas) substitution in electricity generation under increased availability of natural gas in the United States. We observe that changes in elasticities of substitution from pre-2009 to post-2009 differ across states suggesting that the effects of increased availability of inexpensive natural gas on electricity generation have been spatially heterogeneous. We rely on the observed heterogeneity to assess the effects of fossil fuel input substitution on technical efficiency and CO2 emissions. The results reveal that state level elasticity of substitution between natural gas and coal has a positive effect on technical efficiency and a negative effect on CO2 emissions.

Granodiorite and monzodiorite dykes emplaced into the faults predate and are synchronous with propylitic and sericite–ankerite alteration overprinted by the ore. Arsenopyrite and chlorite thermometry and fluid-inclusion data indicate ore formation at 420 ± 30 °C and 300 MPa and cooling to the ambient temperature at 10 km depth (250–300 °C). Fimiston refractory ore (7 g/t Au) in propylitic Golden Mile Dolerite is zoned from inner albite–ankerite to outer ankerite–phengite–quartz replacement. Pyrite–magnetite is overprinted by pyrite–hematite ± anhydrite. Arsenical pyrite encloses chalcopyrite, tennantite, gold and tellurides. Gold thio-sulfide complexes, buffered by magmatic SO2 and H2S in the fluid, were destabilised during the ankerite–pyrite replacement of propylitic chlorite, a reaction releasing hydrogen ions for the hydrolitic alteration of adjacent albite. Gold deposition was assisted by declining gold, silver, tellurium and sulfur solubility as the fluid cooled. Dissolved sulfate is recorded in pyrite by negative δ34S (− 10 to − 5‰) at magmatic Δ33S (0–0.2‰). Oroya ore bodies are subdivided into oxidised pyrite lodes (5 g/t Au) in propylitic GMD and reduced lodes (30–120 g/t Au) characterised by Stage 1 silica–pyrite and siderite–chlorite replacement in ankerite-rich wall rocks. Rapid cooling, an acidic fluid and the retrograde solubility of ankerite facilitated replacement and the deposition of minor arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and gold. Locally, the H2S-rich fluid (log fS2 = − 5.8 ± 0.5 bar at 420 °C) was reduced by organic methane. Oroya Stage 2 ore fills crosscutting veins and cements breccia. Quartz, chalcedony, dolomite–ankerite, calcite, V-muscovite, V-chlorite and V-tourmaline form the gangue of pyrite–telluride ± magnetite ore. Altaite–tellurium myrmekites were deposited at ≥ 400 °C as melt droplets together with tellurantimony, altaite, calaverite, montbrayite and petzite. As fluid temperature and tellurium fugacity declined, free gold, krennerite, coloradoite and melonite also crystallised joined by sylvanite and hessite below 350 °C.

Oroya stage 1 ore (12–14 g/t Au) is characterized by chert-like quartz, Fe-chlorite, siderite and pyrite (10–20 vol%), minor arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite, and accessory pyrrhotite, gersdorffite, and melonite. Dendritic pyrite and arsenopyrite-chlorite thermometry indicate rapid precipitation from an H2S-dominant fluid of intermediate sulfidation and low oxidation state cooling from 450–400 to 340 °C. Oroya stage 2 ore (120–600 g/t Au) forms veins and breccia filled or cemented by quartz, muscovite (≤ 13.2 wt% V2O3), ankerite, chlorite, and tourmaline (≤ 14.7 wt% V2O3). The assemblage pyrite-arsenopyrite-chalcopyrite brackets telluride deposition. Bornite-chalcopyrite aggregates, sphalerite, and tetrahedrite are associated with native gold, montbrayite, altaite, calaverite, petzite, tellurantimony, coloradoite, and melonite. Myrmekitic altaite-tellurium ± sylvanite and altaite-krennerite symplectites represent melt droplets deposited at &gt; 400 °C and log fTe2 = − 4 bar (400 °C, 200 MPa). Tellurium fugacity declined as the fluid cooled during the deposition of native gold and free telluride grains terminating in melonite replacement at 340–300 °C. Pyrite-nolanite- and pyrite-magnetite-telluride assemblages suggest oxidation states up to 2 log units higher than during stage 1. After telluride deposition, the fluid evolved to a high sulfidation state (log fS2 = − 5 bar at 300 °C) and increased salinity indicated by digenite-covellite and Cl-bearing altaite. The average ore is enriched in lithophile (K, Rb, Cs), siderophile (Fe, V, Ni, W), and chalcophile elements (e.g., Te, Se, Cu, Zn, Pb) implicating local monzodiorite plutons as the fluid source. Stable isotope data from the Oroya kersantite and from Cu-Au skarn and monzodiorite-granodiorite stocks southeast of Kalgoorlie constrain the composition of the magmatic fluid to δ13CPDB = − 3.0 to − 2.2‰ and δ18OSMOW = 8.3 to 9.7‰. In the Golden Mile, the fluid oxygen isotope ratios of the gold ore bodies (8.2 to 9.8‰) are consistent with I-type magmatic water. The fluid carbon isotope ratios of all altered rocks (δ13CPDB = − 1.7 to − 0.5‰) are 13C-enriched, perhaps due to the reduction of fluid CO2 to CH4 by interaction with ferrous greenstones close to the intrusion. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Gold; Golden Mile; Kalgoorlie; Melt; Oroya; Telluride","gold; lead; melt inclusion; mineralization; mineralogy; pyrite; stable isotope; telluride; tellurium; vanadium; Australia; Kalgoorlie; Western Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064832284

The ideal solution would be to combine modernisation activities in terms of energy use in cities with sustainable strategies and redevelopment policies. The article's purpose is to estimate the potential for reducing energy consumption depending on socioeconomic factors (household standard and its location in the city) based on built-in scenarios and searching for the optimal way of conducting development policy at the local level. This assumption enables the implementation of the European Union climate policy. To this aim, modelling based on real and estimated data on the diversity of energy consumption in the structure of a medium-sized city in Europe (Zielona Góra) carried out. While creating scenarios, there used a modelling method based on radial artificial neural networks, which map the input set into the output set by matching many individual approximating functions to setpoints. This approach works well for data whose geolocation is in the city quarters. As a result of the simulations, the minimum and maximum achievable energy saving potential for low-intensity buildings in the quarters was estimated, taking into account the possibilities of investing in renewable energy by individual households. The observations included in the article may be relevant to other regions that are interested in reducing the energy consumption of buildings and pollution emissions from the cities. This is particularly important for the regions of Europe that benefit from the financial support of the European Union (including local development programmes based on financing European priority axes for economic development). © 2020 The Authors","Energy efficiency strategies (EES); Geographic information systems (GIS); Household standards; Radial neural networks; Renewable energy source (RES); Urban city structure","Climate change; Computer aided software engineering; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Geographic information systems; Neural networks; Renewable energy resources; Energy saving potential; Energy-efficiency strategies; Reducing energy consumption; Renewable energy source; Socio-economic factor; Socioeconomic aspects; Sustainable strategies; Urban cities; Economic and social effects; artificial neural network; energy efficiency; European Union; fossil fuel; GIS; household structure; modernization; redevelopment; urban area; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079833073

Two fundamentally different technologies exist for harvesting sunlight to offset fossil fuel use - solar thermal (ST) and photovoltaic (PV) collectors. The former convert sunlight into heat while the later convert sunlight directly into electricity (although electricity can be converted into heat via heat pumps and/or resistance heating). If/when factories transition towards utilizing their rooftops for solar harvesting, an essential question will be: which solar technology, or a mix of technologies, should be chosen for factory rooftops? This paper investigates this (as yet unanswered) question by assessing the global greenhouse gas emission (GHGe) mitigation potential of PV and ST collectors in a side-by-side mix (e.g. a percentage where 0% is solely PV and 100% is solely ST available roof area coverage) to supply medium temperature heat (150 °C-400 °C) for industrial processes. It was found that in most locations globally, a mix of both technologies optimizes the solar output. Globally, installing the optimum PV:ST mix can save up to 141.8 or 205.8 kt CO2e over installing solely PV or solely ST collectors, respectively. Another interesting finding of this study was that GHGe mitigation potential stems largely from where the solar collectors were manufactured (i.e. the embodied emissions from using local primary energy to fabricate the collectors). Thus, this study reveals that project managers, policymakers, corporate sustainability directors, etc could achieve maximum global GHGe mitigation through simply considering a mix of solar collector technologies and the best practices for manufacturing them. © 2020 The Author(s).

Climate smart water management (reducing influx of organic matter and improving water quality) is therefore a potentially strong mitigation tool. We hypothesize that climate smart water management has a stronger mitigation potential than reducing emissions from the operational management of a Water Authority. Based on literature data on greenhouse gas emissions from ditches and agricultural peatlands, we present a case study of a Dutch Water Authority - Amstel, Gooi and Vecht (operated by Waternet). We estimate that greenhouse gas emissions from the 195 km2 large peat area within its territory are 470 kt CO2-eq per year. An additional 231 ktCO2-eq yr-1 is emitted from the water bodies within the 102 km2 large water area territory. Both emissions are considerably higher than the estimated climate footprint of the operational management of the water board (∼ 62 ktCO2-eq per year in 2017). While Waternet strives to have a net zero emission of greenhouse gases related to its operational management by 2020, we postulate that measures (to be taken before 2030) such as the prevention of organic matter and nutrients entering surface waters, the removal of organic carbon from ditches and higher groundwater levels in agricultural peatlands, may reduce greenhouse gas emissions in ditches and agricultural peat meadows with 26 and 27 ktCO2-eq per year, respectively. Measures that are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in water bodies are expected to have a positive impact on water quality as well. ©Author(s) 2020.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biogeochemistry; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Organic carbon; Peat; Quality management; Subsidence; Surface waters; Water conservation; Water quality; Wetlands; Climate footprints; Literature data; Operational management; Potential impacts; Reducing emissions; Water boards; Water quantities; Zero emission; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088229932

Despite their important roles, metabolic dynamics of GSLs under various growth conditions remain poorly understood. To determine how light conditions influence the levels of different GSLs and their distribution in Arabidopsis leaves, we visualized the GSLs under different light conditions using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging. We observed the unique distribution patterns of each GSL in the inner regions of leaves and marked decreases under darkness, indicating light conditions influenced GSL metabolism. GSLs are hydrolyzed by a group of ß-glucosidase (BGLU) called myrosinase. Previous transcriptome data for GSL metabolism under light and dark conditions have revealed the highly induced expression of BGLU30, one of the putative myrosinases, which is also annotated as Dark INducible2, under darkness. Impairment of the darkness-induced GSL decrease in the disruption mutants of BGLU30, bglu30, indicated that BGLU30 mediated GSL hydrolysis under darkness. Based on the GSL profiles in the wild-type and bglu30 leaves under both conditions, short-chain GSLs were potentially preferable substrates for BGLU30. Our findings provide an effective way of visualizing GSL distribution in plants and highlighted the carbon storage GSL function. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Especially, important is the reduction of unburned hydrocarbon (HC) from fuel film on liner under cold condition. In this study, at first, quantitative fuel film measurement technique by using Laser Induced Exciplex Fluorescence (LIEF) was developed. For the light source, 4th harmonic pulse yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser (266nm) was used. For the tracer, the combination of N,N-Dimethylaniline (DMA) and naphthalene was used and quantitative concentration was decided by calibration test. With LIEF, the distribution of fuel film can be obtained by measuring the fluorescence only from the liquid phase. In order to evaluate the effect of fuel film on exhaust HC emission from engine, the film distribution was measured using quartz glass liner. For the injector, a prototype 6-hole gasoline injector was used. For the evaluation of total amount of fuel film on liner, the film distribution image was taken from both the exhaust and front side. The effect of fuel pressure (between 20 to 60 MPa) and of temperature was analyzed. Then, the correlation between the measured total amount of fuel film and the unburned HC from the engine was confirmed by the engine test. Additionally, a computer fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation model was validated against the measured results and a design with better flow rate of each hole was proposed. Additionally, the fuel film results were tried to explain from the character of spray. Spray velocity and vaporization rate were decided by direct scattering measurement of spray. And liquid particle diameter was also measured by two methods [phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA), combination of Mie scattering and LIEF]. These spray results were compared with theory and confirmed the validity of the results. Finally, the effect of fuel pressure and temperature et al. to fuel film was explained by the measured spray character. © 2020 SAE International.

However, they are among the most threatened ecosystems, being very vulnerable to global change, and require special attention towards its conservation. Knowing their climate change mitigating potential, conservation measures should also be oriented with a climatic approach, to strengthen their regulatory services. In this work we studied the carbon biogeochemistry and the specific relevance of certain microbial guilds on carbon metabolisms of the three main types of deltaic wetlands located in the Ebro Delta, north-eastern Spain, as well as how they deal with human pressures and climate change effects. We estimated the metabolic rates of the main carbon-related metabolisms (primary production and respiration) and the resulting carbon and global warming potential balances in sites with a different salinity range and trophic status. With the results obtained, we tried to define the influence of possible changes in salinity and trophic level linked to the main impacts currently threatening deltaic wetlands, on the C-metabolisms and GHG emissions, for a better understanding of the mitigating capacity and their possible enhancement when applying specific management actions. Metabolic rates showed a pattern highly influenced by the salinity range and nutrients inputs. Freshwater and brackish wetlands, with higher nutrient inputs from agricultural runoff, showed higher C-capture capacity (around 220–250 g C m-2 y-1), but also higher rates of degradative metabolisms (aerobic respiration and CH4 emissions). Contrastingly, the rates of C-related metabolisms and C-retention of Salicornia-type coastal salt marshes were lower (42 g C m-2 y-1). The study of the microbial metacommunity composition by the16S RNA gene sequencing revealed a significant higher presence of methanogens in the salt marsh, and also higher metabolic potential, where there was significantly more organic matter content in sediment. Salinity inhibition, however, explained the lower respiration rates, both aerobic and anaerobic, and prevented higher rates of methanogenesis despite the major presence of methanogens. Conservation measures for these wetlands would require, overall, maintaining the sediment contributions of the river basin intending to overcome the regression of the Delta and its salt marshes in a climate change scenario. Particularly, for reducing degradative metabolisms, and favour C-retention, nutrient inputs should be controlled in freshwater and brackish wetlands in order to reduce eutrophication. In salt marshes, the reduction of salinity should be avoided to control increases in methanogenesis and CH4 emissions. © 2020 Morant et al.

Of particular importance are the communities most directly impacted. The current study focuses on a random sample of 970 adults in eight counties within the oil and gas industry-reliant region of southeast Texas in order to explore support for carbon capture and storage (CCS), which is a climate change mitigation technology that has seen a great deal of investment in that area. Results of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis and general linear modeling (GLM) suggest that policy support –individual support and perceived community support – is dependent on perceived risks and benefits of CCS, community-focused perceptions (including Bourdieu's social capital), and perceptions about stakeholders (trustworthiness and expected role in CCS policy making). One key takeaway is that social capital was both a predictor and moderator in community-level CCS support and helped explain the hidden effects of risk perception of CCS and CCS knowledge on community-level CCS support.

A main barrier to portfolios' decarbonization is the lack of conclusive evidence on whether low-carbon investments add value to a portfolio, and on whether markets react to climate announcements by rewarding (penalizing) low-carbon (carbon-intensive) assets. To fill this gap, we develop an empirical analysis of the low-carbon and carbon-intensive indices for the EU, US and global stock markets. We test if financial markets are pricing the Paris Agreement (PA) by decreasing (increasing) the systematic risk and increasing (decreasing) the portfolio weights of low-carbon (carbon-intensive) indices afterwards. We find that after the PA the correlation among low-carbon and carbon-intensive indices drops. The overall systematic risk for the low-carbon indices decreases consistently, while stock markets' reaction is mild for most carbon-intensive indices. Moreover, the weight of the low-carbon indices within an optimal portfolio tends to increase after the PA. This evidence suggests that stock market investors have started to consider low-carbon assets as an appealing investment opportunity after the PA but have not penalized yet carbon-intensive assets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Asset pricing; Carbon-intensive indices; Fama-French five-factor model; Low-carbon indices; Market model; Markowitz's portfolio optimization; Paris Agreement announcement; Risk-adjusted return; Stranded assets; Systematic risk","correlation; empirical analysis; financial system; global climate; international agreement; investment; optimization; price dynamics; risk assessment; stock market; sustainability; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077925293

In Southern Africa, rainfall is expected to decline by almost 10% by the year 2050 and the largest increase in temperature can be experienced. Despite the potential risks of climate change on agricultural productivity, Botswana does not have a dedicated policy to respond to climate change. Furthermore, there is a dearth of research done in Botswana to provide an understanding of factors that shape farmers’ adaptation to climate change and institutional link to the adaptive capacity of farming households. Therefore, the aim of this article is to analyse institutions that influence farmers’ adaptation strategies of farmers in Botswana, using Ngamiland East as a case study. The paper relies on empirical data collected from purposively selected key informants and 300 households. The results show that the majority of farmers who have climate variability adaptation strategies in place are largely influenced by indigenous knowledge. Women and low-income earners are less likely to employ climate change adaptation strategies in order to improve their agricultural productivity. This article gives a better perspective of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats facing institutions designed to enable agricultural productivity. It recommends that macro-level and local government institutions should acknowledge the indigenous knowledge, community-level institutions and farmers’ adaptive capacity in policy formulation processes. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Botswana; Climate change adaptation; Institutions; Small-scale farmers; Southern Africa; SWOT analysis","Agriculture; Productivity; Societies and institutions; Botswana; Climate change adaptation; Small scale farmers; Southern Africa; SWOT analysis; Climate change; adaptive management; agrarian change; agrometeorology; climate change; design method; empirical analysis; indigenous knowledge; smallholder; Botswana; Ngamiland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077607143

However, the application of this concept in planning and enhancing climate change resilience is negligible in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This article reviews state-of-the-art research on the potential contribution of peri-urban ecosystem services to climate change resilience in SSA and identifies research gaps for further work. This study was conducted through systematic review of articles from the Web of Science. The literature shows limited knowledge on peri-urban ecosystem services research globally and SSA in particular. The gaps in this knowledge stem from inadequate conceptualization and lack of understanding about how such knowledge can be translated into policy, planning and management and, hence, realizing development goals. In nutshell, the potential for climate change resilience of well-managed peri-urban ecosystem services includes reducing the physical exposure of peri-urban areas to floods and droughts and minimizing climate change risks through increased socio-economic resilience to hazard impacts and provision of the carbon sequestration function. However, specific peri-urban studies describing ecosystem service types and how they can be synchronized into mainstream urban planning and climate change resilience strategies are lacking in most SSA urban regions/landscapes. Therefore, case studies need to be conducted to contextualize and downscale the concept in peri-urban areas and to determine how the concept can be synchronized into broad urban planning and strategies for enhancing resilience to climate change in vulnerable urban and peri-urban communities. © 2020, The Author(s).","Climate change; Planning and management; Policy; Sustainable development; Urban landscape",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079825598

Several factors such as maternal, environmental, clinical, and social factors influence birthweight, and these vary geographically, including across low, middle, and economically advanced countries. The aim of the study was to investigate the geographical modification of the effect of oxides of nitrogen exposure on birthweight adjusted for clinical and socio-demographic factors. Data for the study was obtained from the Mother and Child in the Environment birth cohort study in Durban, South Africa. Pregnant females were selected from public sector antenatal clinics in low socioeconomic neighborhoods. Land use regression models were used to determine household level antenatal exposure to oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Six hundred and seventy-seven births were analysed, using the geoadditive model with Gaussian distribution and identity link function. The newborns in the cohort had a mean birthweight of 3106.5 g (standard deviation (SD): 538.2 g and the maternal mean age was 26.1 years (SD: 5.7). A spatially modified NOx exposure-related effect on birthweight was found across two geographic regions in Durban.

Despite widespread recognition for the need for urgent action on climate change, transformation to a zero carbon economy is still elusive. While there are detailed accounts of organisational responses to climate change impacts, little is known about climate change inaction. We adopt the theoretical framework of resilience in social-ecological systems to explore the change processes needed to overcome climate change inaction. Through an in-depth case study of an Australian energy company, we identify the impediments to climate change action due to rigidity and scarcity traps at three levels: micro (organisation), meso (industry), and macro (government). These traps inhibit transformation from a fossil fuel regime to a renewable energy regime. Our study contributes to a multi-level theory of organisational inaction on climate change by identifying specific causal factors that erode systemic adaptive capacity, increasing the probability of rigidity and scarcity traps. We find that different inaction occurs at all three levels, and is closely interconnected (across levels) within a social-ecological system, due to dynamic antecedents (e.g. changing individual attitudes, business practices, and government policies). Competencies, resources, and cultural changes can help organisations traverse rigidity and scarcity traps to overcome climate change inaction. © 2020, © 2020 Environment Institute of Australia and New Zealand Inc.","Adaptive cycle; business model transformation; climate change; energy sector; resilience; social-ecological systems","alternative energy; climate change; climate effect; energy policy; local government; organizational framework; renewable resource; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085509605

However, the role of such alerts in raising awareness of air quality is unknown. We conducted this study to evaluate associations between days with Air Quality Index ≥101, corresponding to a categorization of air quality as unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy, or hazardous, and air quality awareness among adults in the United States. Methods: Data from 12,396 respondents to the 2016–2018 ConsumerStyles surveys were linked by geographic location and survey year to daily Air Quality Index data. We evaluated associations between the number of days in the past year with Air Quality Index ≥101 and responses to survey questions about awareness of air quality alerts, perception of air quality, and changes in behavior to reduce air pollution exposure using logistic regression. Results: Awareness of air quality alerts (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15, 1.31), thinking/being informed air quality was bad (PR = 2.02; 95% CI = 1.81, 2.24), and changing behavior (PR = 2.27; 95% CI = 1.94, 2.67) were higher among respondents living in counties with ≥15 days with Air Quality Index ≥101 than those in counties with zero days in the past year with Air Quality Index ≥101. Each aspect of air quality awareness was higher among adults with than without asthma, but no differences were observed by heart disease status. Across quintiles of the number of days with Air Quality Index ≥101, air quality awareness increased among those with and without selected respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Conclusions: Among U.S. adults, air quality awareness increases with increasing days with alerts of unhealthy air. These findings improve our understanding of the extent to which air quality alerts prompt people to take actions to protect their health amidst poor air quality. © 2020","Adults; Air quality; Behavior; Environmental health; Epidemiology","adult; air quality; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; confidence interval; epidemiology; index method; perception; pollution exposure; respiratory disease; spatiotemporal analysis; adult; aged; air pollution; air quality; Article; asthma; chronic obstructive lung disease; emphysema; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; United States; young adult; air pollutant; air pollution; attitude to health; cardiovascular disease; government; heart disease; prevalence; United States; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Heart Diseases; Humans; Male; Prevalence; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078669875

As an alternative for capital-intensive engineering approaches, plantation forestry has been advocated as an eco-friendly option to offset hydrological imbalances (bio–drainage) mainly for dryland salinity conditions. With robust monitoring world over, reforestation mainly with fast growing versatile Eucalyptus species have emerged as the most water profligate. These lower the water–table by extracting soil water throughout the year and even from deeper soil and phreatic zones. The annual evapo-transpiration of plantations vary from about 0.2 to 0.8 times OPE (Open Pan Evaporation) under dryland conditions and can equal or even exceed OPE under irrigated conditions. The factors like soil and climatic conditions, groundwater depth and its quality, growth rates of tree species; their stocking, patterns and the geometries and fraction of area under plantations define their effectiveness for water table draw-down and salinity control. Nevertheless, the emerging arguments against bio–management include long time–lag, high land requirements and decline in their efficiency with salinity build-up underneath plantations. To overcome these constraints, shifting plantations in between discharge and recharge areas, reforestation with salt-tolerant species, integrating these with cropping systems and even with engineering measures in saline discharge areas are the alternate options. The gainful employment of bio-drainage demands the diagnosis of typical areas to be reforested in catchments using GIS/remote sensing tools, the development of decision support systems (DSS) for appropriate designing of reforestation strategies and their amalgamation with existing farming systems. Benefits of plantations beyond on-and off-site salinity control should aim at enhanced farm incomes, restoring biodiversity and particularly carbon trading when global interests are now targeting climate mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-drainage; Groundwater balance; Plantation forestry; Salinity mitigation; Tree water-use; Water-logging control","Arid regions; Artificial intelligence; Biodiversity; Catchments; Decision support systems; Drainage; Emission control; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Logging (forestry); Metals; Reforestation; Soil moisture; Timber; Transpiration; Arid and semi-arid regions; Climatic conditions; Decision support system (dss); Engineering measures; Plantation forestry; Salinity mitigation; Tree water use; Water logging; Quality control; emissions trading; mitigation; plantation forestry; salinity; water depth; water table; water use; waterlogging; Eucalyptus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078961177

These tax expenditures provide an opportunity to consider design issues, the relationship between tax expenditures and other non-fiscal policy instruments and the influence of legal frameworks. The article explores tax expenditures that have been in effect in the US and Spain. In the US, the federal government since 1992 has provided an income tax credit for the production of electricity from renewable sources, and more recently the alternative of an investment tax credit. In Spain, since the 1990s there has been an important debate on the best way to promote renewable energies; different tax incentives, subsidies, and regulated prices have been used in one way or another over time. Drawing on these two case studies, the comparative analysis highlights lessons that emerge about the role of taxation as a regulatory instrument and its consistency with other policies in shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.

Data from field experiments were applied to define the effects of the organic and conventional crop farming systems. Both manure and mineral fertilizers were applied to the conventional and only manure in the organic rotations. The closed chamber method was employed to calculate carbon footprints of emitted and absorbed CO2 fluxes. The carbon flows in different agro-ecosystems were also analysed by the estimation of the biomass and leaf area index. The carbon footprints per hectare obtained for the organic farming systems were significantly lower than those obtained for the conventional ones. These results imply that the analysis of the whole crop rotation based on the LCA remains an important issue for analysis of the effects of farming. The introduction of ley and maize into the both organic (OF) and conventional farming (CF) systems resulted in the highest sank of C rates from the atmosphere that has been accumulated in highest net ecosystem production (NEP). The estimates of the carbon footprint indicate the capability of crops to sequester atmospheric carbon in biomass. Nonetheless, out of the crops considered, only ley featured the positive carbon balance and the lowest environmental impact due to the lowest CO2 emissions and LCA indices in both farming systems. The results imply that reasonable crop-mix within the crop rotation schemes may lead to reduction of CO2 emissions (i.e. their environmental impact) and mitigation of the climate change. However, the differences between the carbon footprint for the OF and CF agroecosystems were insignificant in general. © 2020","barley; CO2 emissions; environment; farming; rapeseed; wheat","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crops; Ecosystems; Emission control; Fertilizers; Life cycle; Manures; Organic carbon; barley; CO2 emissions; environment; farming; rapeseed; wheat; Carbon footprint; agricultural ecosystem; barley; carbon budget; carbon emission; crop rotation; life cycle analysis; net ecosystem production; organic farming; agroecosystem; Article; bioaccumulation; biomass; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; conventional farming; ecosystem; farming system; leaf area; life cycle assessment; limit of quantitation; Lithuania; manure; net ecosystem production; organic farming; priority journal; Kaunas; Lithuania; Brassica napus; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078301250

Using the case of Canada, this study investigates the extent to which increasing ZEV charging and refuelling availability may boost ZEV sales relative to other ZEV-supportive policies. We adapt a version of the Respondent-based Preferences and Constraints (REPAC) model using 2017 survey data from 1884 Canadian new vehicle-buyers to simulate the sales impacts of increasing electric vehicle charging access at home, work, public destinations, and on highways, as well as increasing hydrogen refuelling station access. REPAC is built from a stated preference choice model and represents constraints in supply and consumer awareness, as well as dynamics in ZEV policy out to 2030. Results suggest that new ZEV market share from 2020 to 2030 does not substantially benefit from increased infrastructure. Even when electric charging and hydrogen refuelling access are simulated to reach “universally” available levels by 2030, ZEV sales do not rise by more than 1.5 percentage points above the baseline trajectory. On the other hand, REPAC simulates ZEV market share rising as high as 30% by 2030 with strong ZEV-supportive policies, even without the addition of charging or refuelling infrastructure. These findings stem from low consumer valuation of infrastructure found in the stated preference model. Results suggest that achieving ambitious ZEV sale targets requires a comprehensive suite of policies beyond a focus on charging and refueling infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Charging; Climate policy; Consumer behavior; Electric vehicle; Hydrogen fuel-cell; Zero-emission vehicle","Air pollution; Charging (furnace); Commerce; Competition; Consumer behavior; Electric vehicles; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Sales; Surveys; Climate policy; Consumer valuations; Electric vehicle charging; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; Hydrogen refuelling stations; Supportive policies; Zero emission vehicles; Charging (batteries); consumption behavior; electric vehicle; emission control; environmental policy; fuel cell; fuel consumption; hydrogen; transportation infrastructure; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080876828

A SEAP Implementation Index (SII) is developed and applied to study climate change mitigation actions implemented by 102 Municipalities belonging to the Metropolitan City of Milan (Italy) in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors (CoM). The SII is composed of six categories and 16 sub-indicators and results in a final score ranging from 1 to 10. The average rating obtained in the case study area is 4.2, and only eleven Municipalities achieved an evaluation higher than 6. The sensitivity analysis shows the index robustness against variations in the applied weight factors. The population engagement and the management of the initiative, neglected by many Municipalities mostly because of a lack of funding and personnel, are identified as the most critical aspects. Despite the massive participation in the CoM, no quantitative analysis of the SEAPs implementation has been proposed until now and this study shows some severe shortcomings in their application. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Covenant of mayors; Local authorities; Mitigation; SEAP implementation index (SII)","carbon dioxide; climate change; emission control; mitigation; quantitative analysis; sensitivity analysis; article; carbon footprint; climate change; funding; human; Italy; quantitative analysis; sensitivity analysis; Italy; Lombardy; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079015539

The lake is the water supply source for a population of ~60,000. We modeled past temperature, and concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and phosphorus (P) in Lake Auburn by considering the catchment and internal contributions of P as well as atmospheric factors, and predicted the change in lake water quality in response to future climate and land-use changes. A stream hydrology and P-loading model (SimplyP) was used to generate input from two major tributaries into a lake model (MyLake-Sediment) to simulate physical mixing, chemical dynamics, and sediment geochemistry in Lake Auburn from 2013 to 2017. Simulations of future lake water quality were conducted using meteorological boundary conditions derived from recent historical data and climate model projections for high greenhouse-gas emission cases. The effects of future land development on lake water quality for the 2046 to 2055 time period under different land-use and climate change scenarios were also simulated. Our results indicate that lake P enrichment is more responsive to extreme storm events than increasing air temperatures, mean precipitation, or windstorms; loss of fish habitat is driven by windstorms, and to a lesser extent an increasing water temperature; and catchment development further leads to water quality decline. All simulations also show that the lake is susceptible to both internal and external P loadings. Simulation of temperature, DO, and P proved to be an effective means for predicting the loss of water quality under changing land-use and climate scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Lake modeling; Land-use change; Linked models; Phosphorus; Sediment diagenesis","Atmospheric temperature; Biochemical oxygen demand; Catchments; Climate models; Dissolved oxygen; Greenhouse gases; Lakes; Land use; Phosphorus; Runoff; Sediments; Storms; Water quality; Water supply; Climate change scenarios; Extreme storm events; Lake model; Land-use change; Linked model; Sediment geochemistries; Water quality parameters; Water supply sources; Climate change; dissolved oxygen; lake water; phosphorus; climate change; concentration (composition); diagenesis; dissolved oxygen; lake water; land use change; mesotrophic environment; phosphorus; temperate environment; water chemistry; water quality; water temperature; air temperature; Article; atmosphere; carbon footprint; catchment; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental enrichment; environmental temperature; fish; geochemistry; habitat; hurricane; hydrology; lake; lake model; land use; meteorology; nonbiological model; nonhuman; precipitation; priority journal; sediment; simulation; stream (river); United States; water quality; water temperature; Maine; United States; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077733224

These initiatives have resulted in new challenges in the power sector, and to address them adequately, innovative frameworks are required in the electric distribution network (EDN) expansion planning and operation problems. Therefore, this work proposes an environmentally committed asset planning approach to remedy the existing issues to some extent. The proposed strategy investigates the benefits of the simultaneous allocation of several assets such as capacitor banks (CBs), distributed generation (DG) units based on renewable energy sources, and energy storage systems (ESSs). Moreover, an innovative carbon emission trading scheme is formulated in the planning stage to mitigate the CO2 emissions while a demand response program is applied to modify the consumption behavior. The proposed approach is formulated as a two-stage robust mixed-integer programming model, which considers uncertainties associated with the electricity demand and renewable-based DG. To cope with the difficulties of this complex model, utilizing an efficient decomposition algorithm, such as the C&amp;CG decomposition algorithm, is essential. The potential of the proposed approach is studied under different operating conditions and via several test cases on a 137-node EDN. In addition, to validate the performance of the proposed carbon emission scheme, a multi-region 54-node distribution network is adequately evaluated. Results show that by considering simultaneously multiple planning alternatives, carbon emission trading scheme, and the demand response program, the total CO2 emissions are reduced by up to 15%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Asset planning; Carbon emission trading; Demand response; Distributed generation; Distribution networks","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Electric power distribution; Emission control; Integer programming; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Asset planning; Carbon emission trading; Demand response; Demand response programs; Different operating conditions; Distributed generation units; Energy Storage Systems (ESSs); Mixed integer programming model; Electric network parameters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077507925

The mangrove forest in the Bali Province is divided into three habitat types, namely an open bay located in the West Bali National Park, a semi-closed bay located in Tahura Ngurah Rai and a small island in the protected forest of Nusa Lembongan. The objective of this study is to analyse the relationship between carbon stock characteristics of mangrove forests with the different types and morphologies of mangrove forest habitats. Biomass calculations were carried out by using the allometric formula. However, the similar allometric equations produced varying accuracies at different locations. Results revealed that the mangrove forest carbon stock for the semi-closed bay habitat has the highest estimation value of 51.35 tons/ha and a positive relationship pattern of 60 %. On the contrary, the lowest carbon stock value is the open bay beach with a value 26.28 tons/ha and positive relationship pattern of 48 %.

In this study, wheat straw (WS) was co-composted with iron oxide and allophanic soil and their influence on WS composting and composition of the end-products was evaluated. WS compost and their humic like-substances (HS) fraction were characterized by chemical and spectroscopic analyzes. After 126 days of process, the elemental composition showed slight differences of the N content for compost and HS, where the C/N atomic ratio tended to decrease relative to the initial material (WS; ~130). This trend was more pronounced in the HS from co-composted treatments (&lt;30). The addition of inorganic materials increased the total acidity and phenolic-OH group contents (~15 and 14 mEq g−1 respectively, iron oxide treatment) relative to the treatment without inorganic additives. Nevertheless, the FTIR and solid-state 13CNMR spectroscopy barely support the wet chemical analysis and revealed a similar final composition between all the studied compost treatments. These results suggest that the incorporation of these materials as compost additives had no major effect on the spectroscopic features of the end-products, however, critical changes of the properties such as the extractability, functionality and composition of HS were revealed by traditional methods. In conclusion, the supply of metal oxides and clays could impact the aerobic composting of WS favorizing the stabilization of certain C pools and adsorptive properties of the end-products, that is of importance in production of amendments suitable for being used in degraded and contaminated soils. Nevertheless, under the experimental conditions of our research C stabilization apparently depends of other mechanisms that still need to be elucidate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Clay minerals; co-composting; Metallic oxides; Waste management; Wheat straw","carbohydrate; carbonyl derivative; cellulose; iron oxide; lignin; organic matter; oxygen; polysaccharide; uronic acid; acidity; additive; carbon sequestration; chemical analysis; clay mineral; compost; composting; contaminated land; detection method; greenhouse gas; humic substance; organic matter; soil pollution; straw; waste management; acidity; Article; carbon nitrogen ratio; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; chemical analysis; chemical composition; chemical structure; composting; elemental analysis; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; humic substance; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078194039

However, the physiological function of DMSP has remained enigmatic for >30 yr. Recent insight suggests that there are different physiological roles for DMSP based on the cellular DMSP concentrations in producers. Differential production of DMSP was tested with multiple physiological experiments that altered nitrate availability, salinity and temperature to create stressed growth and target different metabolic conditions in Emiliania huxleyi, a high DMSP producer and Thalassiosira oceanica, a low DMSP producer. Emiliania huxleyi intracellular DMSP did not respond to metabolically imbalanced conditions, while Thalassiosira oceanica intracellular DMSP was significantly correlated to stressed growth rate across all conditions tested and exhibited a plastic response on a timescale of hours in nonsteady-state. The previous assumption that proposed DMSP mechanism(s) can be universally applied to all producers is shown to be unlikely.

By Paris-aligned, we mean consistent with the Paris Agreement adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, at Paris, France, in December 2015 (UNFCCC 2015). We compare and contrast this quota with both the aspirations expressed in the current Irish National Policy Position and current national emission projections. The fair share quota is assessed as a maximum of c. 391 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2), equal to 83 tonnes of carbon dioxide (tCO2) per capita, from 2015, based on a precautionary estimate of the global carbon budget (GCB) and specific interpretation of global equity. Given Ireland’s high current CO2 per capita emission rate, this would correspond to sustained year-on-year reductions in nett annual CO2 emissions of over − 11% per year (beginning as of 2016). By contrast, the CO2 mitigation target indicated in the National Policy Position corresponds to nett annual reduction rates in the range of only −4.7% per year (low ambition) up to a maximum of − 8.3% per year (high ambition), and projections based on current and immediately planned mitigation measures indicate the possibility, instead, of sustained increases in emissions at a rate of the order of + 0.7% per year. Accordingly, there is a large gap between Paris-aligned ambition and current political and policy reality on the ground, with a significant risk of early emergence of “CO2 debt” and tacit reliance on rapid deployment of currently speculative (at a relevant scale and feasible cost) negative CO2 emission technologies to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere. While the detailed policy situation will clearly differ from country to country, we suggest that this methodology, and its CO2debt framing, may be usefully applied in other individual countries or regions. We recommend that such framing be incorporated explicitly into a global mitigation strategy via the statements of nationally determined contributions required to be submitted and updated by all parties under the Paris Agreement processes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon debt; Carbon dioxide removal; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Global carbon budget; National carbon quota; Negative carbon dioxide emissions","carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; international agreement; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; France; Ile de France; Ireland; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068921905

Phenology, the timing of seasonal biological events including leaf-out, flowering, fruiting, and leaf senescence, is among the most visible and oft-recorded facets of plant ecology. Climate-driven shifts in plant phenology can alter reproductive success, interspecific competition, and trophic interactions. Low-cost phenology research, including observational records and experimental manipulations, is fundamental to our understanding of both the mechanisms and effects of phenological change in plant populations, species, and communities. Traditions of local-scale botanical phenology observations and data leveraged from written records and natural history collections provide the historical context for recent observations of changing phenologies. New technology facilitates expanding the spatial, taxonomic, and human interest in this research by combining contemporary field observations by researchers and open access community science (e.g., USA National Phenology Network) and available climate data. Established experimental techniques, such as twig cutting and common garden experiments, are low-cost methods for studying the mechanisms and drivers of plant phenology, enabling researchers to observe phenological responses under novel environmental conditions. We discuss the strengths, limitations, potential hidden costs (i.e., volunteer and student labor), and promise of each of these methods for addressing emerging questions in plant phenology research. Applied thoughtfully, economically, and creatively, many low-cost approaches offer novel opportunities to fill gaps in our geographic, taxonomic, and mechanistic understanding of plant phenology worldwide. © 2020 McDonough MacKenzie et al.

However, evidence suggests there will be considerable inertia between climate change and shifts in plant species distributions, for example due to resident communities resisting changes, the redistribution of resident species’ abundances, and dispersal limitation of species attempting to track preferred climates. Objectives: To test how inertia in community responses to climate change may affect future primary productivity, and the capacity for communities to respond through local redistribution of abundances. Methods: We assessed relationships between community functional trait distributions, climate and environment with a remote-sensed measure of gross primary productivity (GPP) across 1032 woody plant communities and projected these spatially under current and future climates. Using a simulation approach, we also tested the capacity for communities to achieve future trait distributions by shifting the relative abundances of resident species. Results: We found that climate change is likely to reduce GPP in southeast Queensland, and, contrary to expectations, there is little evidence to suggest distributional inertia will contribute substantially to this loss. We show that sites with high existing functional diversity are well-placed to achieve predicted future trait compositions in the absence of long-distance dispersal through redistribution of resident species abundances. Conclusions: Our results show that sites with high existing functional diversity are well placed to achieve predicted future trait compositions in the absence of long-distance dispersal through abundance redistribution of resident species, but it is unlikely this will mitigate strong climate change-driven losses of productivity. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Biogeography and macroecology; Climate change; Ecosystem function; Functional traits","abundance estimation; climate change; climate effect; community response; functional response; functional role; future prospect; net primary production; Australia; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081920483

The droplet size distribution (DSD) of clouds is an excellent proxy that connects cloud microphysical properties with radiative impacts on our climate. However, traditional radiometric instruments are information-limited in their DSD retrievals. Radiometric sensors can infer droplet effective radius directly but not the distribution width, which is an important parameter tied to the growth of a cloud field and to the onset of precipitation. DSD heterogeneity hidden inside large pixels, a lack of angular information, and the absence of polarization limit the amount of information these retrievals can provide. Next-generation instruments that can measure at narrow resolutions with multiple view angles on the same pixel, a broad swath, and sensitivity to the intensity and polarization of light are best situated to retrieve DSDs at the pixel level and over a wide spatial field. The Airborne Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (HARP) is a wide-field-of-view imaging polarimeter instrument designed by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), for retrievals of cloud droplet size distribution properties over a wide swath, at narrow resolution, and at up to 60 unique, co-located view zenith angles in the 670 nm channel. The cloud droplet effective radius (CDR) and variance (CDV) of a unimodal gamma size distribution are inferred simultaneously by matching measurement to Mie polarized phase functions. For all targets with appropriate geometry, a retrieval is possible, and unprecedented spatial maps of CDR and CDV are made for cloud fields that stretch both across the swath and along the entirety of a flight observation. During the NASA Lake Michigan Ozone Study (LMOS) aircraft campaign in May-June 2017, the Airborne HARP (AirHARP) instrument observed a heterogeneous stratocumulus cloud field along the solar principal plane. Our retrievals from this dataset show that cloud DSD heterogeneity can occur at the 200 m scale, much smaller than the 1-2 km resolution of most spaceborne sensors. This heterogeneity at the sub-pixel level can create artificial broadening of the DSD in retrievals made at resolutions on the order of 0.5 to 1 km. This study, which uses the AirHARP instrument and its data as a proxy for upcoming HARP CubeSat and HARP2 spaceborne instruments, demonstrates the viability of the HARP concept to make cloud measurements at scales of individual clouds, with global coverage, and in a low-cost, compact CubeSat-sized payload. © 2020 Author(s).",,"aerosol composition; airborne survey; cloud droplet; data set; heterogeneity; irradiation; size distribution; spatial data; stratocumulus; Baltimore County; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Michigan; Maryland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083265240

Recent work unveils a new dimension to this polarization story: newly elected Republican women are driving this polarization. Women are more likely to legislate on women’s issues than men, yet women’s shared interest in representing women doesn’t preclude their identity as partisans. In this article, we explore the effect of today’s political climate on state legislators’ policy representation of women’s issues. We ask what effect does gendered polarization have on women’s issues? To test this, we evaluate bill sponsorship in the states on the quintessential “women’s issue” of abortion. Our research design focuses on bill introductions and uses on an original dataset of pro- and anti-abortion rights bill introductions, which we analyze using an event count model. We find that overall polarization leads to the introduction of fewer restrictive abortion bills, but as polarization between women lawmakers grows, legislators are more likely to introduce anti-abortion rights legislation. Gender polarization has consequences on the types of bills legislators introduce and for how scholars should study polarization. © 2020 De Gruyter.

It is used as a heat sink of HTHP that uses waste heat from the supermarket's refrigeration system as a heat source whereas it is used as a heat source to HTHP that provides heat to industrial applications. When the DHN acts as the heat sink, the integrated system provides a coefficient of performance (COP) of the waste heat recovery (WHR) system between 3.2 and 5.4, reducing the operating costs between 50% and 100% with an average price ratio of 2.25 compared with the standard CO2 refrigeration system. If the DHN is the heat source, the integrated system provides a COP from 2.8 to 5.7 for a heat sink of 110 °C. The alternative low-GWP refrigerants assessment illustrates that HC-290, HFO-1234ze(E) and HFO-1234yf were considered the ideal candidates to replace the HFC-134a, whereas HCFO-1233zd(E) and HCFO-1224yd(Z) were the most promising low-GWP refrigerants to replace HFC-245fa. Finally, the environmental results showed that the utilisation of the DHN as the heat sink in the integrated system solution produces about 60% lower equivalent CO2 emissions than the DHN generation mix. Moreover, using DHN as the heat source, the equivalent CO2 emissions can be reduced up to 98% in Sweden compared to conventional natural gas boilers. Hence, the combination of HTHPs and the DHN represents a step forward in the mitigation of climate change through the utilisation of sustainable energy conversion technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2; Environmental analysis; HTHP; Sustainability; Waste heat recovery","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coefficient of performance; Computer system recovery; Energy conversion; Gas emissions; Heat pump systems; Heat sinks; Heating equipment; Industrial refrigeration; Integrated control; Natural gasoline plants; Operating costs; Refrigerants; Sustainable development; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; District heating networks; Environmental analysis; Generation mix; High temperature heat pump; HTHP; Integrated systems; Refrigeration system; Sustainable energy; District heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082016828

Purpose: We aim to present the first three-body theoretical results for the radius and total reaction cross sections of F31. This will further help to investigate how the pairing and the breakdown of the N=28 shell closure influence the formation of the 2n-halo structure and the antihalo effect in this mass region. Methods: A F29+n+n three-body system is described by the cluster orbital shell model, and its total reaction cross section is calculated by the Glauber theory. Results: Our three-body calculations predict 3.48-3.70 fm for the root-mean-square radius of F31, which corresponds to the total reaction cross section of 1530 (1410) to 1640 (1500) mb for a carbon target at 240 (900) MeV/nucleon. The binding mechanism and halo formation in F31 are discussed. Conclusions: The present study suggests a novel antihalo effect in this mass region: When the pairing overcomes the energy gap between the p3/2 and f7/2 orbits, the inversion of the occupation number of these orbits takes place, and it diminishes the 2n-halo structure. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084985631

Sustainable Land Management (SLM) practices (such as reduced tillage, no-tillage, cover crops, etc.,) have the potential to reduce soil, organic carbon (OC), and nutrient losses by erosion. However, the effectivity of these practices is site-dependent and varies under different rainfall conditions. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effects of SLM practices – in two rainfed systems (a wheat field and an almond orchard) representative of a large area of the driest Mediterranean regions - on runoff, soil erosion, particle size distribution, and OC and nutrient (N and P) contents in sediments. The influence of the rainfall characteristics on the effectiveness of the SLM practices was also evaluated. The SLM implemented were: reduced tillage (RT) in the wheat field and almond orchard and reduced tillage combined with green manure (RTG) in the almond orchard; these were compared to conventional tillage, the usual practice in the area. Open erosion plots were set up to monitor the effects of SLM on soil carbon and nutrients and on soil erosion after each rainfall event over six years (2010–2016). The results show that the SLM practices evaluated resulted in increased organic carbon (OC) and nutrients (N and P) contents in the soil, and reduced runoff, erosion, and mobilization of organic carbon and nutrients in sediments. Reductions in runoff of 30% and 65% and decreases in erosion of 65 and 85% were found in the wheat field and almond orchards, respectively. In addition, the total OC, N, and P losses in the wheat field were reduced by 56%, 45%, and 64%, respectively, while in the almond field the OC, N, and P losses were reduced by 90% under RT and by 85% under RTG. The beneficial effect of the SLM practices on soil erosion was observed within 18 months of their implementation and continued throughout the six years of the study. Furthermore, the effectiveness of tillage reduction with respect to erosion control and carbon and nutrients mobilization was highest during the most intense rainfall events, which are responsible for the highest erosion rates in Mediterranean areas. Our results support the key role of SLM practices under semiarid conditions as useful tools for climate change mitigation and adaptation, given the expected increase in high-intensity rainfall events in semiarid areas. © 2019 The Authors","Green manure; Organic carbon; Rainfed agroecosystems; Soil fertility; Tillage","agricultural ecosystem; erosion control; land management; long-term change; management practice; manure; Mediterranean environment; nutrient loss; orchard; organic carbon; precipitation intensity; rainfed agriculture; runoff; soil erosion; soil fertility; soil management; sustainability; tillage; wheat; Prunus dulcis; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075892785

Metagenomics and CH4 data were available from 63 bovines of a two-breed rotational cross, offered two basal diets. Co-abundance network analysis revealed 10 clusters of functional niches. The most abundant hydrogenotrophic Methanobacteriales with key microbial genes involved in methanogenesis occupied a different functional niche (i.e., “methanogenesis” cluster) than methylotrophic Methanomassiliicoccales (Candidatus Methanomethylophylus) and acetogens (Blautia). Fungi and protists clustered together and other plant fiber degraders like Fibrobacter occupied a seperate cluster. A Partial Least Squares analysis approach to predict CH4 variation in each cluster showed the methanogenesis cluster had the best prediction ability (57.3%). However, the most important explanatory variables in this cluster were genes involved in complex carbohydrate degradation, metabolism of sugars and amino acids and Candidatus Azobacteroides carrying nitrogen fixation genes, but not methanogenic archaea and their genes. The cluster containing Fibrobacter, isolated from other microorganisms, was positively associated with CH4 and explained 49.8% of its variability, showing fermentative advantages compared to other bacteria and fungi in providing substrates (e.g., formate) for methanogenesis. In other clusters, genes with enhancing effect on CH4 were related to lactate and butyrate (Butyrivibrio and Pseudobutyrivibrio) production and simple amino acids metabolism. In comparison, ruminal genes negatively related to CH4 were involved in carbohydrate degradation via lactate and succinate and synthesis of more complex amino acids by γ-Proteobacteria. When analyzing low- and high-methane emitters data in separate networks, competition between methanogens in the methanogenesis cluster was uncovered by a broader diversity of methanogens involved in the three methanogenesis pathways and larger interactions within and between communities in low compared to high emitters. Generally, our results suggest that differences in CH4 are mainly explained by other microbial communities and their activities rather than being only methanogens-driven. Our study provides insight into the interactions of the rumen microbial communities and their genes by uncovering functional niches affecting CH4, which will benefit the development of efficient CH4 mitigation strategies. © Copyright © 2020 Martínez-Álvaro, Auffret, Stewart, Dewhurst, Duthie, Rooke, Wallace, Shih, Freeman, Watson and Roehe.","functional niches; metagenomics; methane emissions; network analysis; rumen microbiome","methane; algorithm; Article; beef cattle; bovine; chemical composition; comparative study; correlational study; dry matter intake; ecological niche; host microbe interaction; metagenomics; methanogenesis; microbial community; network meta-analysis; nonhuman; rumen microorganism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084081914

Lianas contribute to forest ecosystem functioning globally, but especially in the tropics and subtropics. However, prolific liana growth following heavy disturbance frequently affects subsequent recovery of forest tree diversity, biomass, structure, and function. Understanding this forest liana dynamic, and its sensitivity to climate and anthropogenic forces, is essential for worldwide forest restoration and climate change mitigation. Here, we synthesise the evidence for both positive and negative effects of lianas on forests and propose a framework that outlines the expected global response of forests to disturbance-induced liana proliferation. Emerging evidence suggests that lianas play a major role in both facilitating and delaying forest recovery following disturbance. At low levels of disturbance and/or where environmental conditions favour tree growth, lianas can facilitate forest recovery by protecting trees from extreme weather, fire, weed invasion and herbivory. However, under conditions where lianas proliferate beyond critical thresholds, positive feedbacks are expected to induce and sustain liana-dominated forest states that can endure for decades or even longer. We conceptualise alternative classes of forest recovery response to disturbance and describe measurement and modelling of liana thresholds. We identify four essential challenges for global change science relating to lianas: (1) incorporation of lianas and sapling stems into forest monitoring and tree stand measurements worldwide; (2) long-term experiments to determine variation in liana-tree competition, and potential drivers across forest successional gradients; (3) identification and prediction of liana thresholds and other alternative forest recovery response classes; and (4) dynamic mechanistic modelling of forest recovery to determine regional and global variation within and among different recovery response classes, in relation to variation in potential drivers, liana feedbacks and their interactions. Addressing these challenges will determine the importance of lianas in shaping regional and global forest composition, recovery and dynamics. © Copyright © 2020 Marshall, Platts, Chazdon, Seki, Campbell, Phillips, Gereau, Marchant, Liang, Herbohn, Malhi and Pfeifer.","ecosystem health; liana; rainforest; succession; tipping point; tropics; vine; weed",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097562825

Moreover, local pollution effects are generated by several pollutants, such as CO, NOx, SOx, VOC, and PM, produced during combustion in transports or building thermal plants. Because of the increasing demand for mobility at an urban scale, pollution caused by transportation plays a significant role. To reduce its environmental impact, a partial or total replacement of old and polluting vehicles with more ecological ones must be urgently implemented. With this aim, in the paper, a detailed analysis of the vehicle fleet of the city of Reggio Calabria (Italy), with reference to passenger cars has been carried out, elaborating four scenarios to reduce their pollutant emissions from 2017 to 2025, both greenhouse gases and local scale ones, through the replacement of old and polluting vehicles with hybrid or electric ones. © 2020 by the authors.","Ecological vehicle; Gas emissions reduction; Pollutant; Transport; Vehicle fleet","carbon monoxide; emission; geothermal power; greenhouse gas; nitric oxide; particulate matter; pollution incidence; power plant; sulfur compound; volatile organic compound; Calabria; Italy; Reggio di Calabria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083578631

The study site is one of the climate change prone areas affected by climate variability and extreme events. Therefore, a better understanding of area-specific and adaptation is crucial to develop and implement proper adaptation strategies that can alleviate the adverse effects of climate change. Therefore, this work was aimed to identify determinants of farmers' adoption of climate change adaptation strategies in Gondar Zuria District of northwestern Ethiopia. Primary data were collected through semi-structured questionnaires, observation, and interviews. Besides, the secondary data were also obtained from journal articles, reports, governmental offices, and the internet. The Multinomial and Binary logistic regression models with the help of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (21th edition) were used to analyze the data. The multinomial logistic regression model was used to estimate the influence of the socioeconomic characteristics of sample households on the farmer's decision to choose climate change adaptation strategies. The result showed that age, gender, family size, farm income, and farm size had a significant influence on the farmers' choice of climate change adaptation strategies. The result also revealed that crop failure, severe soil erosion and shortages of water are major climate change-related problems than others. In order to alleviate these problems, farmers have implemented mixed farming, mixed cropping, early and late planting (changing sowing period), use of drought-resistant crop varieties, application of soil and water conservation techniques, shifting to non-farm income activities and use of irrigation. In contrast, access to climate information, total annual farm income, and market access variables are significant adoption determinants of climate change adaptation strategies by farmers' in the study site. Therefore, we recommend future adaptation-related plans should focus on improving climate change information access, improving market access and enhancing research on the use of rainwater harvesting technology. © 2020Climate change, Adaptation strategies, Binary logistic regression, Gondar zuria district, Agricultural science; Environmental science; Earth sciences; Biological sciences; Sociology © 2020","Adaptation strategies; Agricultural science; Binary logistic regression; Biological sciences; Climate change; Earth sciences; Environmental science; Gondar zuria district; Sociology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083777082

Here, we describe a rapid, economical, and green one-pot microwave synthetic procedure for the preparation of ternary nanocomposites carbon/polydopamine/Au nanoparticles (C/PDA/AuNPs; C = carbon nanotubes (CNTs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO)). No harsh reaction conditions were used in the method, as are used in conventional hydrothermal or high-temperature methods. The PDA unit acts as a non-covalent functionalizing agent for carbon, through stacking interactions, and also as a stabilizing agent for the formation of AuNPs. The CNTs/PDA/AuNPs modified electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity to oxidize chloramphenicol and the resulting sensor exhibited a low detection limit (36 nM), wide linear range (0.1-534 TM), good selectivity (against 5-fold excess levels of interferences), appreciable reproducibility (3.47%), good stability (94.7%), and practicality (recoveries 95.0%-98.4%). Likewise, rGO/PDA/AuNPs was used to fabricate a sensitive folic acid sensor, which exhibits excellent analytical parameters, including wide linear range (0.1-905 TM) and low detection limit (25 nM). The described synthetic route includes fast reaction time (5 min) and a readily available household microwave heating device, which has the potential to significantly contribute to the current state of the field. © 2020 by the authors.

Here, we present the iron- and carbon-regulated transcriptomes of a representative marine copiotroph, Alteromonas macleodii ATCC 27126, and characterize its cellular transport mechanisms. ATCC 27126 has distinct metabolic responses to iron and carbon limitation and, accordingly, uses distinct sets of TonB-dependent transporters for the acquisition of iron and carbon. These distinct sets of TonB-dependent transporters were of a similar number, indicating that the diversity of carbon and iron substrates available to ATCC 27126 is of a similar scale. For the first time in a marine bacterium, we have also identified six characteristic inner membrane permeases for the transport of siderophores via an ATPase-independent mechanism. An examination of the distribution of specific TonB-dependent transporters in 31 genomes across the genus Alteromonas points to niche specialization in transport capacity, particularly for iron. We conclude that the substrate-specific bioavailability of both iron and carbon in the marine environment will likely be a key control on the processing of organic matter through the microbial loop. IMPORTANCE As the major facilitators of the turnover of organic matter in the marine environment, the ability of heterotrophic bacteria to acquire specific compounds within the diverse range of dissolved organic matter will affect the regeneration of essential nutrients such as iron and carbon. TonB-dependent transporters are a prevalent cellular tool in Gram-negative bacteria that allow a relatively high-molecular-weight fraction of organic matter to be directly accessed. However, these transporters are not well characterized in marine bacteria, limiting our understanding of the flow of specific substrates through the marine microbial loop. Here, we characterize the TonB-dependent transporters responsible for iron and carbon acquisition in a representative marine copiotroph and examine their distribution across the genus Alteromonas. We provide evidence that substrate-specific bioavailability is niche specific, particularly for iron complexes, indicating that transport capacity may serve as a significant control on microbial community dynamics and the resultant cycling of organic matter. © 2020 Manck et al.","Alteromonas; Carbon transport; Gene expression; Iron transport; Marine microbiology; TonB","6 phosphogluconate dehydratase; adenosine triphosphatase; alpha arabinofuranosidase; alpha galactosidase; alpha glucosidase; bacterial enzyme; bacterioferritin; beta glucosidase; beta n acetylhexosaminidase; carbon; cytochrome c oxidase; ferric citrate; hydrolase; hydrolyase; iron; permease; protein TonB; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); siderophore; superoxide dismutase; transcriptome; ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; unclassified drug; xylan 1,4 beta xylosidase; Alteromonas; Alteromonas macleodii; amino acid sequence; Article; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; carbon metabolism; cell transport; citric acid cycle; fatty acid oxidation; fatty acid synthesis; gene expression; gene locus; inner membrane; iron metabolism; iron transport; marine bacterium; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; nutrient limitation; open reading frame; organisms by carbon source; oxidative phosphorylation; respiratory chain; ribosome; sequence alignment; transcriptomics; upregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087134462

However, water scarcity due to climate change and pollution and the depletion of fossil fuels together with their negative impact on the environment, pose a great global threat. Solar assisted-photocatalysis is a promising tool for environmental pollution mitigation and for generating alternative renewable energy. This review provides a one-stop, comprehensive read on the most recent developments in graphene based photocatalysts towards removal of organic (dyes, emerging pollutants), inorganic (heavy metals, oxides of nitrogen), microbial pollutants and fuel generation from carbon dioxide reduction and water splitting. We began by providing a brief overview of the positive attributes of photocatalysis and the use of graphene in photocatalytic nanostructures. This is followed by the investigation of the latest applications of graphene based photocatalyst in water treatment, air purification, disinfection and energy generation. Details on the specific roles of graphene materials during photocatalysis and the underlying mechanisms propelling the different photocatalytic reactions, are outlined.

Solving bi-objective optimization models to obtain the set of trade-off solutions can be time consuming. To avoid the computational effort, in this paper, a new algorithm is developed to obtain the solutions for the bi-objective models with carbon pricing policies using the solutions of the bi-objective model without carbon pricing. The algorithm is based on mathematical properties of optimum solutions of bi-objective models with and without carbon pricing policies. These properties are proved mathematically. The developed algorithm is applied to a case study of a biomass-fed district heating system. Results indicate that the number of optimum solutions to the bi-objective models decrease when emissions are priced compared to when emissions are not priced. The increase in total cost for mitigating a given quantity of emission is more for the carbon offset model compared to the carbon tax and the carbon cap-and-trade models. Pair-wise comparison of the models indicates that the carbon tax model has more cost than the carbon cap-and-trade and the carbon offset models.

The difficulties in interpreting isotopic data are related to the integral effect of several factors controlling the 13C/12C ratio in plants and soils, namely, the environmental conditions and the composition of soil organic matter. The study of Albic Retisols and Luvic Chernozems indicates that the extractable humus fractions are enriched in heavy isotope 13C relative to the total soil organic matter. In Retisols, the increased δ13С values are typical of humic acids below the humus horizon and for fulvic acids within the entire profile. In Luvic Chernozems, the 13C-enriched fraction is only fulvic acids. Thus, changes in the 13C/12C ratio in soils, in particular, its increase with depth, can be explained by migration of labile humus fractions in the profile and by their accumulation in deeper horizons. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",": Retisols; Chernozems; fulvic acids; humic acids; δ13C","carbon isotope ratio; Chernozem; fulvic acid; humus; isotopic composition; soil carbon; soil organic matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084406539

However, empirical basis for sector-specific understanding of the adoption behaviour of the farmers to climate change is merely established, prompting the current study on adoption of CSA strategies among resource-constrained dairy farmers particularly in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). The case study employed a joint analysis framework of both multivariate probit (MVP) and ordered probit models to analyse farmers’ joint adoption decisions for four on-farm strategies namely: improved fodder, feed conservation, artificial insemination and manure management. The case study, involving 132 dairy farmers from a representative Murang’a County in Kenya revealed that adoption of CSA practices among farmers is widespread in the study area, with majority of the farmers (87%) adopting at least two of the four considered strategies. However, the specific adoption rates were relatively low, ranging from 27% for manure management to 66% for improved fodder and thus the need to target the less adopted strategies and incentivise the farmers to intensify their implementation. The findings show interdependence of the strategies with complementarity and substitutionality relationships among the practices. The interdependence can facilitate the tailoring of suitable packages of strategies which are interrelated to optimise their synergies. Capital, gender, water availability, market access and infrastructure and social networks were found to be the most important determinants of adoption decision as well as the intensity of adoption. These findings from dairy sector-specific data in Kenya are significant to provide tailored and targeted policies in scaling up adoption and intensification of CSA strategies to advance climate smart dairy production systems in SSA. © 2020 Fundacion CIPAV.

However, in India, limited regional studies are available to understand the fishers’ local knowledge, and a crucial question which largely remained unaddressed has been how fishers perceive the relevance of their local knowledge systems in the face of climate change. Provided this background, this paper aims to explore the fishermen’s local knowledge and their climate perceptions in the face of climate change. This paper has employed the data that were obtained by in-depth interviews and focus-group discussions with the small-scale fishermen of three highly vulnerable fishing villages of Nagapattinam district, Tamil Nadu. The marine fishers across this coast were the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami disaster, several major cyclones, and various weather and climate events for over the last four decades. Key results show (1) fishermen perceive multiple aberrations and anomalies in the weather and climate patterns for over the previous three to four decades, particularly after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami disaster. (2) The next finding is contrary to the conventional understandings, in which we have found that the fishermen are increasingly felt and experienced that their local knowledge is no longer adequately relevant in the face of climate change. Thus, for promoting the adaptive capacity of fishers, this paper has suggested that fishermen’s perceptions and their expectations should be appropriately recognized and there is a strong need to provide scientific assistance to the fishermen through proper channels to respond to climate change impacts. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Climate perceptions; Fishermen; India; Local knowledge; Tamil Nadu","climate change; climate effect; coastal zone; disaster management; exploration; fishing community; perception; questionnaire survey; traditional knowledge; vulnerability; India; Indian Ocean; Nagapattinam; Tamil Nadu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081252922

Managing the urban environment presents a major challenge: preserving environmental resources and also ensuring decent living conditions for the current population and for future generations. In the era of motorized and carbonized transport, vehicles are the main source of emission of atmospheric pollutants, mainly in large urban centers and important precursors of ozone. An important advance in minimizing vehicle emissions was the introduction of cleaner and additive fuels into the Brazilian market. The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of the Dienitro additive on the NOx and CO emissions in buses of collective transport, Diesel S-50 exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and S-10 with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and EGR systems. Measurements of CO and NOx gas emissions were carried out using a gas analyzer in S50 and S10 diesel buses with an EGR and SCR systems from a company operating in the collective transport of Biguaçu. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, 20 measurements were performed without additives and 20 measurements with additivation in each bus, making it possible to calculate the average emission rate of CO and NOx, pollutant gases with toxic effect. Findings: The usage of Dienitro additive in diesel engines resulted in a significant reduction in the emission of polluting gases, carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxide (NOx), thus being efficient in reducing the emissions of these gases. Originality/value: The Dienitro additive was first tested on diesel engines by public transport buses, and there is great potential for reducing the emission of toxic gases. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Buses; Diesel; Emissions; Pollutants","additive; carbon emission; carbon monoxide; nitrogen oxides; traffic emission; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074877989

In the current context of sustainable development research, biogas cogeneration has great potential to replace fossil fuels used in many areas of energy consumption. Thus, the interest of cogeneration lies in the higher energy yields obtained compared to an equivalent separate production of electricity and heat. It also makes a good contribution to global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The cogeneration system under study uses an internal combustion engine, connected to a synchronous generator that supplies a local load. In order to better meet the defined objectives, the study and modeling of the system are organized into four key points: (1) the regulation of the temperature of biogas production system at a predefined set point, (2) mathematically model the biogas production system, in order to study the influence of temperature on the performance of the system (volume of biogas produced), (3) an extensive definition of the general concepts related to the design of energy systems, (4) dynamic modeling of an internal combustion engine, (5) modeling of a permanent like synchronous machine. © 2020 IEEE.","biogas cogeneration; biogaz; development; dynamic model; mathematical model; renewable energies; Valorization","Cogeneration plants; Combustion; Dynamic models; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Biogas production systems; Cogeneration systems; Energy systems; Energy yields; Peak energy demand; Production technology; Renewable energies; Synchronous machine; Biogas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085531277

The thermochemical reactions that can discharge heat at a higher temperature usually requires a relatively higher desorption temperature during charging process, which could be problematic to efficiently recover solar energy in high-latitude regions like the UK when using the most mature and economic solar thermal collector (flat-plate or evacuated tube type). The present work studied two hybrid concepts where an electric-driven compressor or an electric heater was introduced to supplement the thermochemical desorption process in terms of pressure rise and temperature lift, respectively, when the available solar heat was not sufficiently high. The SrCl2-8/1NH3 chemisorption was selected from 230 ammonia-chemisorption reactions due to its suitable adsorption/desorption temperature and large energy storage density. The performance of two hybrid systems using SrCl2-8/1NH3 chemisorption were evaluated and compared to determine the optimal solution. The results revealed that the hybrid thermochemical sorption with a compressor substantially improved the storage capacity compared to that with electric heater. With a compression ratio of 4, the SSTES system with 20 m2 solar collector under the weather condition of Newcastle upon Tyne can store 3226.8 kWh chemisorption heat in summer by charging 4465.4 kWh solar heat and 848.2 kWh electricity, indicating 60.7% storage efficiency; the corresponding energy density based on the overall system volume is 147.3 kWh/m3. Because of using the renewable solar heat and low carbon intensity electricity in summer, the proposed hybrid SSTES system has noteworthy reduction on carbon emission compared to gas boiler and conventional heat pump. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Compressor; Electric heater; Hybrid system; Seasonal storage; Solar energy; Thermochemical sorption","Ammonia; Carbon; Chemisorption; Collector efficiency; Compressors; Desorption; Electric discharges; Electric heat treatment; Electric heating; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating equipment; Hybrid systems; Solar energy; Solar heating; Ammonia chemisorption; Desorption temperatures; Electric heater; Energy storage density; Seasonal solar thermal energy storages; Seasonal storage; Solar thermal collector; Thermochemical reactions; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081002620

An extended STIRPAT model based on the classical IPAT identity is adopted to uncover the main drivers for total energy consumption in Suzhou, an important manufacturing city in China, during 2006 to 2016. The main conclusions are as follow: (1) Foreign trade, economic growth, and industrialization are the three dominant contributors to energy consumption increments. Furthermore, quite significant portion of Suzhou's foreign trade is processing exports. The export products are mainly high-energy consumption such as electromechanical, chemical, textile, etc. The export-oriented economy is accelerating the economic growth and industrialization, and also strengthening the energy intensive regional development mode. (2) Urbanization and population size are also the main driving factors for the rapid growth of energy consumption in Suzhou. The population scale effect exhibits the urban function of absorb employment and agglomerate population in Suzhou, it also demonstrates the growing energy demands caused by population growth and the accompanying urbanization process. (3) Energy consumption intensity and energy consumption structure are the important influencing factor in curbing energy consumption in Suzhou. Energy saving effects played by energy consumption intensity are stronger than energy consumption structure. The coal-based energy consumption structure has not been changed fundamentally during the research period. Therefore, the energy saving effect of energy structure has not been fully utilized. The current and future major strategies for controlling energy consumption in Suzhou should further improve energy utilization efficiency, optimize energy consumption structure, and reduce the proportion of coal consumption. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy conservation; Environmental protection; International trade; Population statistics; Regional planning; Urban growth; Energy consumption intensity; Energy consumption structure; Energy saving and emission reductions; Energy utilization efficiency; Energy-saving effect; High energy consumption; Regional development; Total energy consumption; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083261758

To protect the environment, the approved up-limitation value of typical ingredient such as non-methane total hydrocarbons (NMHC) is regulated and monitored by local governments. Since there are few available technologies to predict the paint exhaust emission and generate out the operation warning to the workers, this study analyzes the requirements from paint workers with a user case diagram. Then, the cloud technology is introduced to design the system function with a function structure diagram. With the cloud sensing technology layer, platform layer and application layer are designed to form a cloud system used for exhaust emission prediction and warning in spray booth for complex products. To predict the consumable NMHC concentration value, a mathematical model for exhausting prediction is designed. A practical tips algorithm for spray paint operation is figured out.

This study reports levels of aluminium (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn) and nickel (Ni) in the soils where Chinese Prickly Ash - Zanthoxylum bungeanum (ZB) and Z. armatum (ZA) are grown. Soil and pericarp samples were taken from 72 ZB and ZA plantations in 12 provinces. The soil pollution index (PI) was generally low for As (0.04–0.35), Pb (0.01–0.74) and Ni (0.15–1.06). The PI was higher for Cd (0.06–6.99) and was assessed at three categorical levels: ‘low’ (in 26% of soils), ‘moderate’ (in 67% of soils) and high (in 7% of soils). The majority (94%) of soils were slightly polluted with Cd with the integrated pollution index in the range 0.17–2.02. More than 60% of pericarp samples posed a high non-cancer health risk based on the hazard index, while 43% of pericarp samples posed a considerable cancer risk based on the incremental lifetime cancer risk.

Herein, we have developed copper-based catalysts confined within a rationally designed covalent triazine framework (CTF-B), featuring a CuN2Cl2 structure, for selective CO2RR to hydrocarbons with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81.3% and an FE of C2H4 up to 30.6%. Operando X-ray adsorption fine structure analyses reveal the potential-driven dynamic formation of Cu atomic clusters, together with the time-dependent and Cu-content-dependent CO2RR performance associated with the catalyst activation, definitively uncovering that the aggregated Cu clusters confined within CTF-B are the active sites. A further probing experiment of CO electroreduction not only verifies that CO is one of the key intermediates for the CO2RR but also demonstrates the improved selectivity to C2 chemicals, with a maximum FE of 68.4% (C2H4, 35.0%; acetate, 33.4%), possibly originating from the accelerative C-C coupling reaction due to the increased CO coverage and enhanced local pH in CO-saturated electrolyte. Interestingly, acetate is identified as the only liquid product, mostly likely benefiting from the dominant low-coordination active sites of confined Cu aggregation and favorable chemical confinement environment of CTF-B. The strategy of constructing efficient metalloelectrocatalysts by means of confinement in a covalent organic framework along with operando identification of active sites sheds light on the rational catalyst design and structure-property relationship. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","acetate; CO electroreduction; confined Cu catalysts; covalent triazine framework; electrochemical CO2 reduction; hydrocarbon; operando characterization","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Chemical bonds; Chlorine compounds; Copper compounds; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Ethylene; Reaction intermediates; C-C coupling reactions; Catalyst activation; Copper-based catalysts; Covalent organic frameworks; Efficient catalysts; Faradaic efficiencies; High-value chemicals; Structure property relationships; Copper",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084530262

A plant assemblage from the Toupi Formation of Jiangxi, China, provides indirect evidence of the plant–insect interactions that occurred in a Miocene forest community. A total of 123 dicot leaf specimens were examined and 25 of them showed traces of insect herbivory. Twenty-four damage types were identified and categorized into eight functional feeding groups. These traces indicate that insects interacted with these plants for various purposes, including feeding, sheltering and egg laying. To survey the responses of plant–insect interactions to climate conditions, the data on insect damage frequency and temperature variables from the Toupi assemblage and four other assemblages (from the middle Miocene to the early Pleistocene) from China were analyzed based on a linear stepwise regression analysis. The analysis suggests that there is a significant positive correlation between the damage frequency and the coldest month (mean) temperature (CMT) (R2 = 0.709 and P = .047). The present result provides additional support for the hypothesis that the CMT, rather than the mean annual temperature, could be one of the factors influencing the frequency of damage in paleoflora communities. When compared to the four other assemblages, the Toupi assemblage has the lowest damage frequency which could be due to the lowest CMT. It is possible that a low CMT could result in a low insect metabolic rate per unit area and unit time, leading to a low frequency of insect attack and a low herbivory rate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Herbivory; Insect; Plant; Southeastern China; Toupi Formation","herbivory; Miocene; plant community; plant-insect interaction; Pleistocene; terrestrial ecosystem; type specimen; China; Jiangxi; Dicotyledoneae; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078896769

Fluctuations of environmental factors significantly change the conditions for the existence of plants, which dictates the need for adaptive reactions of plant organisms at the different levels of their organization. Such dangerous processes as excessive heating of the surface of plant leaves and water loss can be prevented by the formation of a cuticle, which is a complex composition consisting of cutin and the soluble intracuticular and epicuticular waxes. We suggested that the structure, component composition and properties of the cuticle of trees undergo adaptive changes due to microclimatic conditions in different parts of the tree crown. The study was aimed at the identification and evaluation of light-induced differences in the accumulation and composition of leaf epicuticular waxes of Ulmus trees (native U. minor Mill. and alien U. pumila L.), and was conducted in 2018–2019 in Dnipro city located in the steppe zone of Ukraine. Analysis of the waxes' chloroform extracts was carried out using GC Shimadzu 2010 PLUS equipped with a flame ionization detector and capillary column SP-2560. The highest amount of epicuticular waxes (12.23 ± 0.39 µg/cm2) was on the sunlit leaves of U. pumila, and wax deposits on the sunned leaves exceeded twice those on the shaded leaves in both U. minor and U. pumila. Long-chain hydrocarbons detected in the epicuticular waxes of both elm species were represented by free fatty acids, aldehydes, alcohols, and n-alkanes in various ratios. In the epicuticular waxes of U. minor, fatty acids dominated both on shaded and sunned leaves, while alkanes together with alcohols were the main components in U. pumila waxes, especially on the sunlit leaves. According to our results, local high illumination of leaves in the crown of both elm species caused increase in share of long-chain alkanes (1.2–1.9 times), but simultaneous reduction of the content of free fatty acids (1.5–16.8 times) in the epicuticular waxes' composition. General patterns of the leaf epicuticular waxes' modification due to increased solar radiation and air temperature can indicate the adaptive metabolic responses of woody plants to changing climatic conditions. © 2020 Oles Honchar Dnipro National University.

A slack-based model was used to calculate the CL use efficiency (CLUE) for 11 provinces and cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) from 2007 to 2016, and then a kernel density estimation map was drawn to analyze the spatiotemporal variations of CLUE. The Tobit model was also employed to analyze the factors affecting the CLUE. The results show the following. 1) In the YREB, the CEs from CL showed a rising and then a slowly decreasing trend. In this paper, we calculate CEs by carbon emission factors and major carbon sources, and the CEs from CL in the YREB totaled 25.2354 million tons in 2007. By 2014, the value had increased gradually to 28.4400 million tons, and by 2016 it had declined to 27.8922 million tons, suggesting that the carbon-emission reduction measures of the government had an impact. 2) The CLUE of various provinces and cities in the YREB showed an upward trend in the time dimension, while for the spatial dimension, the kernel density was high in the east and low in the west, and the areas with high kernel density were mainly located in the Yangtze River Delta. 3) The per capita gross domestic product, the primary industrial output, and the number of agricultural technicians per 10,000 people had positive effects on the CLUE.

Timely rain and appropriate temperature predominately affects crop distribution and yield. Climate change is evident in Nepal and it is imperative to understand how it affects habitat suitability of finger millet. Main objective of this study was to map the current suitable habitat and predicting the potential changes in the future under different climate scenarios in Nepal. Habitat mapping is important for maximizing production and minimizing the loss of local landraces. Results: Maxent model was used in this study to quantify the current suitable habitat and changes in the future habitat suitability of finger millet, based on representative concentration pathways (RCP) (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) in two different time periods (2050 and 2070AD) using climatic predictive variables and species localities. The model shows that 39.7% (58512.71 km2) area of Nepal is highly suitable for finger millet, with cultivation mostly between 96 and 2300 m above sea level. Eastern and central parts of Nepal have more suitable areas than western parts. Our research clearly shows that the future climatic suitable area of finger millet would shrink by 4.3 to 8.9% in 2050 and 8.9-10.5% under different RCPs by 2070. Conclusion: Finger millet is mostly cultivated in mid-hill terraces. The substantial increase in temperature due to climate change may be one reason for decrease in habitat suitability of finger millet. This situation would further threat loss of local landraces of finger millet in the future. The findings can help in planning and policy framing for climate resilient smart agriculture practice. © 2020 The Author(s).","Climate change; Finger millet; Habitat suitability; Maxent model","climate change; crop production; crop yield; future prospect; habitat structure; millet; scenario analysis; Nepal; Eleusine coracana; agriculture; climate change; ecosystem; Eleusine; Nepal; Agriculture; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Eleusine; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083071348

We first derive a model-ready parameterization for SOA formation from IVOC emissions from mobile sources. To account for SOA formation from both diesel and gasoline sources, the parameterization has six lumped precursor species that resolve both volatility and molecular structure (aromatic versus aliphatic). We also implement new mobile-source emission profiles that quantify all IVOCs based on direct measurements. The profiles have been released in SPECIATE 5.0. By incorporating both comprehensive mobile-source emission profiles for semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and IVOCs and experimentally constrained SOA yields, this CMAQ configuration best represents the contribution of mobile sources to urban and regional ambient organic aerosol (OA). In the Los Angeles region, gasoline sources emit 4 times more non-methane organic gases (NMOGs) than diesel sources, but diesel emits roughly 3 times more IVOCs on an absolute basis. The revised model predicts all mobile sources (including on- and off-road gasoline, aircraft, and on- and off-road diesel) contribute <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ĝ&circ;1/41</span>&thinsp;<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">μg m-3</span> to the daily peak SOA concentration in Pasadena. This represents a <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ĝ&circ;1/470</span>&thinsp;% increase in predicted daily peak SOA formation compared to the base version of CMAQ. Therefore, IVOCs in mobile-source emissions contribute almost as much SOA as traditional precursors such as single-ring aromatics. However, accounting for these emissions in CMAQ does not reproduce measurements of either ambient SOA or IVOCs. To investigate the potential contribution of other IVOC sources, we performed two exploratory simulations with varying amounts of IVOC emissions from nonmobile sources. To close the mass balance of primary hydrocarbon IVOCs, IVOCs would need to account for 12&thinsp;% of NMOG emissions from nonmobile sources (or equivalently 30.7&thinsp;t&thinsp;d<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">-1</span> in the Los Angeles-Pasadena region), a value that is well within the reported range of IVOC content from volatile chemical products. To close the SOA mass balance and also explain the mildly oxygenated IVOCs in Pasadena, an additional 14.8&thinsp;% of nonmobile-source NMOG emissions would need to be IVOCs (assuming SOA yields from the mobile IVOCs apply to nonmobile IVOCs).<span idCombining double low line""page4314""/> However, an IVOC-to-NMOG ratio of 26.8&thinsp;% (or equivalently 68.5&thinsp;t&thinsp;d<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">-1</span> in the Los Angeles-Pasadena region) for nonmobile sources is likely unrealistically high. Our results highlight the important contribution of IVOCs to SOA production in the Los Angeles region but underscore that other uncertainties must be addressed (multigenerational aging, aqueous chemistry and vapor wall losses) to close the SOA mass balance. This research also highlights the effectiveness of regulations to reduce mobile-source emissions, which have in turn increased the relative importance of other sources, such as volatile chemical products. © Author(s) 2020.

In addition, buildings play a key role for adapting societies to climate change by achieving more energy efficiency. Therefore, buildings have become a key sector to tackle climate change at the local level. However, public decision-makers do not have tools with enough spatial resolution to prioritise and focus the available resources and efforts in an efficient manner. The objective of the research is to develop an innovative methodology based on a geographic information system (GIS) for mapping primary energy consumption and GHG emissions in buildings in cities according to energy efficiency certificates. The developed methodology has been tested in a representative medium-sized city in Spain, obtaining an accurate analysis that shows 32,000 t of CO2 emissions due to primary energy consumption of 140 GWh in residential buildings with high spatial resolution at single building level. The obtained results demonstrate that the majority of residential buildings have low levels of energy efficiency and emit an average of 45 kg CO2/m2. Compared to the national average in Spain, this obtained value is on the average, while it is slightly better at the regional level. Furthermore, the results obtained demonstrate that the developed methodology is able to directly identify city districts with highest potential for improving energy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions. Additionally, a data model adapted to the INSPIRE regulation has been developed in order to ensure interoperability and European-wide application. All these results have allowed the local authorities to better define local strategies towards a low-carbon economy and energy transition. In conclusion, public decision-makers will be supported with an innovative and user-friendly GIS-based methodology to better define local strategies towards a low-carbon economy and energy transition in a more efficient and transparent way based on metrics of high spatial resolution and accuracy. © 2020 by the authors.","Buildings; Climate change; Decision-making tool; Energy efficiency; GHG emissions; GIS; INSPIRE directive","building; carbon emission; climate change; decision making; emission; energy efficiency; GIS; greenhouse gas; hydrocarbon exploration; spatial resolution; strategic approach; urban area; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083561629

While most of existing studies focus on mapping the current state of adaptation plans, there is a significant lack of studies on the current implementation of adaptation strategies. This study addresses this challenge by assessing how coastal adaptation is being financed and implemented in Spain. In the absence of a detailed roadmap for implementing the Spanish Strategy for Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change, we have analysed how adaptation has been and is currently being funded; which the rationale for investments along the territory is; how adaptation investments compare to regular coastal protection costs; and assessed when implemented measures are really adaptation ones. Our results show that the financing source clearly conditions the type of measures implemented, with those funded under the Environment Promotion Plan for Climate Change Adaptation (PIMA Adapta initiative) being dominated by classical coastal engineering actions, whereas ecosystem-related actions are mostly funded under the LIFE programme. In territorial terms, the Mediterranean coastal regions present the most important problems under current conditions and attract most of the funding. Most of the funded actions have been designed to solve current coastal problems, and although they indirectly contribute to adaptation by improving the coastal base status, they are not specifically designed for climate change. This misuse of the concept of adaptation measure will tend to the society to be overconfident about adopted actions whereas we are not progressing to real adaptation. To overcome this risk, it is necessary to have a clear roadmap for implementing adaptation measures together a proper financing structure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change adaptation; Coastal management; Coastal protection; National adaptation strategy; Spain","Coastal zones; Investments; Risk assessment; Shore protection; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Coastal management; Coastal protection; Spain; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; coastal protection; coastal zone management; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076599512

The system highlights economic, socio-cultural, political, and environmental variables, how they are interlinked and thereby influence climate risk to destinations in Vanuatu. It provides a novel tool for understanding climate risk reduction within destinations as a holistic system and based on this understanding, destination trade-offs and policy recommendations are discussed. It can thus aid tourism and climate change decision makers in identifying and testing adaptation measures that benefit not only tourism but the destination more broadly, including the local community and ecosystem health.

These studies have, in turn, challenged our understanding of our own planet's atmospheric dynamics and provided new frameworks with which we can further our understanding of planetary atmospheres. In this work, we use an idealized moist general circulation model in aquaplanet configuration to study the atmospheric circulation of terrestrial planets with high obliquities. With seasonally varying insolation forcing and a shallow slab ocean as a lower boundary, we emphasize seasonal phenomena that might not be captured in simulations with annual mean forcing and that might involve nonlinear behaviors. By progressively increasing obliquity, we explore the response of the large-scale atmospheric circulation to more extreme seasonal cycles and a reversed annual mean equator-to-pole insolation distribution, and its impact on the energy and water cycles. We show that for high obliquities, the large-scale atmospheric circulation and the meridional energy transport are dominated by seasonally reversing broad cross-equatorial Hadley cells that transport energy from the summer to the winter hemisphere and significantly mitigate temperature extremes. These overturning cells also play a major role in shaping the planet's hydrological cycle, with the associated ascending branches and precipitation convergence zones becoming progressively broader and more poleward shifted into the summer hemisphere with higher obliquities. While not embedded within the Hadley cell ascending branches, the hot summer poles of high obliquity planets experience nonnegligible precipitation during and at the end of the warm season: during the summer, lower-level moist static energy maxima at the summer poles force locally enhanced convective activity. As temperatures rapidly drop at the end of the summer and convective activity decreases, the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere decreases and water vapor stored in the atmospheric column rapidly condenses out, extending the duration of the summer pole rainy season into the corresponding autumn. Our study reveals novel understanding of how atmospheric dynamics might influence a planet's overall climate and its variability. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Habitability; High obliquity; Planetary atmospheres",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077689820

Considering the unique geometrical configurations of helical carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and improved properties compared with straight CNTs, we prepared high-purity Co@CoOx/helical nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Co@CoOx/HNCNTs) on a carbon fiber paper by hydrothermal and single-step in situ chemical vapor deposition strategies. Under an optimized growth time (1 h), the synthesized Co@CoOx/HNCNTs provide richer edge defects and active sites and show prominent electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under alkaline media compared with Co@CoOx/HNCNTs-0.5 h and Co@CoOx/HNCNTs-2 h. The soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy technique is used to investigate the influences of different growth times on the electronic structure and local chemical configuration of Co@CoOx/HNCNTs. Furthermore, the Al-air coin cell employing Co@CoOx/HNCNTs-1 h as the binder-free cathode exhibits an open-circuit voltage of 1.48 V, a specific capacity of 367.31 mA h g-1 at the discharge current density of 1.0 mA cm-2, and a maximum power density (Pmax) of 3.86 mW cm-2, which are superior to those of Co@CoOx/HNCNTs-0.5 h and Co@CoOx/HNCNTs-2 h electrodes.

The findings suggest that the change in consumption patterns caused by income inequality may be an important reason for the positive effect of inequality on household carbon emissions and that a lower time preference for consumption and improved mental health can mitigate the positive effect of income inequality on household carbon emissions.

The Full-Spectrum Correlated K-distribution methods (FSCK) with the original correlated-K solution scheme (Modest and Zhang, 2002) and a newly proposed one (Cai and Modest, 2014), and the Rank Correlated Full-Spectrum K-distribution method (RC-FSK) are used in radiative calculations of oxy-fuel flames. Twelve one-dimensional flames, including fuel-air, dry and wet oxy-fuel flames with various length scales, as well as a two-dimensional dry oxy-fuel flame are studied. The results show that the reference temperature has a non-negligible impact on the accuracy of original scheme and the emission-weighted temperature leads to a good accuracy. The accuracy of the new scheme is almost unaffected by the reference temperature, except for small-scale dry oxy-fuel flames. The error of the new scheme is mainly in the low-temperature region, and its accuracy depends on the length scale of computational domain. A hybrid correlated-K scheme using either the original or the new scheme according to local temperature is proposed. It combines the advantages of two schemes in different temperature regions, and is independent of the reference temperature. In addition, the RC-FSK demonstrates almost the same accuracy as FSCK with the hybrid scheme when the Planck temperature is set equal to the reference temperature. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Correlated-K solution scheme; Dry and wet oxy-fuel flames; Full-spectrum correlated K-distribution; Rank correlated full-spectrum K-distribution","Fuels; One dimensional; Radiation effects; Temperature; Computational domains; Correlated-k distribution method; Correlated-K solution scheme; Full spectrum k distributions; K distribution; Low temperature regions; Oxy-fuels; Radiative calculations; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079056038

This paper adopts the Theil index and the partial least square-variable importance of projection (PLS-VIP) method to analyze the change characteristics, regional differences and causes of carbon emissions, as well as the extent to which various factors influenced carbon emissions in China's eight economic regions in 2005-2017. The results indicate that (1) during the study period, carbon emissions in the eight economic regions displayed a rigid uptrend with a phased characteristic. The growth rates of carbon emissions were different across the studied regions. (2) The overall difference in regional carbon emissions showed an increasing trend, mainly owing to increasing interregional differences. (3) The extent of the influence and explanatory ability of each factor on regional carbon emissions and discrepancies in carbon emissions were different. Population size, economic development, and energy intensity were found to be the three main factors influencing regional carbon emission changes. Industrial structure and urbanization were also contributors to regional differences in emissions. The influence of energy structure on regional carbon emissions and its explanatory power were weak on the whole, but its elastic coefficients and VIP values changed significantly. Finally, regionally targeted proposals for emissions mitigation are offered. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emission; China's eight economic regions; PLS-VIP method; Regional difference; Theil index","carbon emission; economic development; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; fossil fuel; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083555818

Specifically, we define GS from aspects of ownership concentration, size of independent director, and state-holding intensity. Through OLS regression, Fixed Effect Test, and Random Effect Test, the change of SO can be robustly explained in a systematic manner. Empirical results present that CMFs’ INTD is lower in general. Stronger state-holding can significantly improve SO, and INTD can motivate ownership concentration to act on SO. Further, INTD that exceeds the average of all sample significantly improves ownership concentration's effect on SO, but lower INTD is unable to promote any GS indicator to produce a positive effect. Additionally, the size of independent director has not been able to improve SO. Our findings indicate that key shareholders’ decision-making authority more directly guides firms’ sustainability, and thus CMFs with centralized governance mode are more likely to develop SO. What's more, global-market expansion provides a feasible path that helps link corporate governance and SO. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese manufacturing firms; Corporate governance; Internationalization; Size of exported products; Sustainable operations","Climate change; Decision making; Industrial management; International trade; Random processes; Corporate governance; Internationalization; Manufacturing firms; Size of exported products; Sustainable operations; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077436714

In this study, a 1D biofilm model embedding the n-DAMO and anammox reactions was developed to facilitate further understanding of the process and its optimization. The model was calibrated and validated using comprehensive data sets from two independent MBfRs, treating sidestream- and mainstream-strength wastewater, respectively. Modelling results revealed a unique biofilm stratification. While anammox bacteria dominated throughout the biofilm, n-DAMO archaea (coupling nitrate reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation) only occurred at the inner layer and n-DAMO bacteria (coupling nitrite reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation) spread more evenly with a slightly higher fraction in the outer layer. The established MBfRs were robust against dynamic influent flowrates and nitrite/ammonium ratios. Thicker biofilms were beneficial for not only the total nitrogen (TN) removal but also the system robustness. Additionally, a positive correlation between the nitrogen removal efficiency and the residual methane emission was observed, as a result of higher methane partial pressure required. However, there was a threshold of methane partial pressure, above which the residual methane increased but nitrogen removal efficiency was stable. Meanwhile, thicker biofilms were also favorable to achieve less residual methane emission. Simulation results also suggested the feasibility of methane-based MBfRs to polish mainstream anammox effluent to meet a stringent N discharge standard (e.g., TN < 5 mg/L). © 2020 The Authors","Anammox; Biological wastewater treatment; Membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR); Modelling; Nitrite/nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-DAMO)","Bacteria; Biofilms; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Efficiency; Effluents; Methane; Models; Nitrogen removal; Oxidation; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Anaerobic methane oxidations; ANAMMOX; Biological waste water treatment; Discharge standards; Membrane biofilm reactor; Nitrogen removal efficiency; Positive correlations; Anaerobic digestion; methane; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen; ammonium; anoxic conditions; biofilm; membrane; methane; modeling; nitrite; oxidation; wastewater treatment; anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Article; calibration; controlled study; cross coupling reaction; embedding; flow rate; mathematical model; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; partial pressure; priority journal; process optimization; simulation; steady state; waste component removal; anaerobic growth; biofilm; bioreactor; chemistry; denitrification; Anaerobiosis; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Methane; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078728467

The strong seasonality of the disease indicates that climatic factors may play important roles in the transmission of the disease. However, the associations between climatic variability and human brucellosis are still poorly understood. Methods: Data for a 14-year series of human brucellosis cases and seven climatic factors were collected in Yulin City from 2005 to 2018, one of the most endemic areas in northern China. Using cross-correlation analysis, the Granger causality test, and a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM), we assessed the quantitative relationships and exposure-lag-response effects between monthly climatic factors and human brucellosis. Results: A total of 7103 cases of human brucellosis were reported from 2005 to 2018 in Yulin City with a distinct peak between April and July each year. Seasonal fluctuations in the transmission of human brucellosis were significantly affected by temperature, sunshine duration, and evaporation. The effects of climatic factors were non-linear over the 6-month period, and higher values of these factors usually increased disease incidence. The maximum separate relative risk (RR) was 1.36 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.81) at a temperature of 17.4 °C, 1.12 (95% CI, 1.03-1.22) with 311 h of sunshine, and 1.18 (95% CI, 0.94-1.48) with 314 mm of evaporation. In addition, the effects of these three climatic factors were cumulative, with the highest RRs of 2.27 (95% CI, 1.09-4.57), 1.54 (95% CI, 1.10-2.18), and 1.27 (95% CI, 0.73-2.14), respectively. Conclusions: In Yulin, northern China, variations in climatic factors, especially temperature, sunshine duration, and evaporation, contributed significantly to seasonal fluctuations of human brucellosis within 6 months. The key determinants of brucellosis transmission and the identified complex associations are useful references for developing strategies to reduce the disease burden. © 2020 The Author(s).","Climatic factors; Distributed lag non-linear models; Granger causality test; Human brucellosis; Quantitative associations","brucellosis; China; human; incidence; public health; risk; season; seroepidemiology; temperature; weather; Brucellosis; China; Humans; Incidence; Public Health; Risk; Seasons; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Temperature; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083631694

In total, 43.5 wt% liquid tar and 23.3 wt% oxidation products were obtained from the two-step degradation. The liquid tar was facilely separated into light oil and asphaltene, with yields of 27.3 wt% and 16.5 wt%, respectively. The first-step degradation has high energy recovery (50%) and low energy consumption ratio (minimum 0.17), indicating an energetic net energy gain. The light oil is a promising feedstock as clean liquid fuels due to its high H/C ratio (1.58) and heating value (34.56 MJ/kg). The asphaltene with lower H/C and O/C ratios but higher aromaticity (0.83) could be a good precursor for carbon materials. The light oil can be upgraded into clean liquid fuels by hydrodeoxygenation or used as feedstock for producing oxygenated chemicals because it is rich in oxygenated components. Phenols and aliphatic esters account for 74.2% of the volatile components in the light oil. High resolution mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the O1–O4 class species are dominant components with relative abundance of 71% in the light oil. Valuable carboxylic acids with total yields of 19.7 wt%, especially alkanedioic and alkanetricarboxylic acids, were produced from oxidation of the scCO2/ethanol degradation residue, which is a promising second-step degradation to utilize the residue.

The pilot plant used 5 m (30 wt %) of aqueous piperazine (PZ) and the advanced stripper (PZAS). 316L stainless steel experienced high corrosion at high temperatures, and the corrosion rate showed strong dependence on temperature. The unexpected vulnerability of 316L was due to the uniquely high operating temperature of PZAS. PZ degradation also had an effect on 316L corrosion. 304 stainless steel and 2205 duplex stainless steel performed well at all temperatures and can be good alternative construction materials for PZAS. Fluid velocity played a bigger role in carbon steel corrosion than temperature because carbon steel corrosion in PZ depends on protective siderite films. Stagnant fluid in the sumps allowed for the formation of compact, protective films, while high-velocity flow might inhibit such film formation. Selective dissolution of Ni from Ni-based alloys into PZ occurred in narrow gaps between alloy and washers. Such localized corrosion can make these alloys not ideal at the joints in pipelines.

The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a sensitive environment to climate change, and understanding its albedo seasonal and inter-annual variations is thus important to help capture the climate change rules. In this paper, we analyzed the large-scale spatial patterns, temporal trends, and seasonal variability of land surface albedo overall the TP, based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43 albedo products from 2001 to 2019. Specifically, we assessed the correlations between the albedo anomaly and the anomalies of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the fraction of snow cover (snow cover), and land surface temperature (LST). The results show that there are larger albedo variations distributed in the mountainous terrain of the TP. Approximately 10.06% of the land surface is identified to have been influenced by the significant albedo variation from the year 2001 to 2019. The yearly averaged albedo was decreased significantly at a rate of 0.0007 (Sen's slope) over the TP. Additionally, the yearly average snow cover was decreased at a rate of 0.0756. However, the yearly average NDVI and LST were increased with slopes of 0.0004 and 0.0253 over the TP, respectively. The relative radiative forcing (RRF) caused by the land cover change (LCC) is larger than that caused by gradual albedo variation in steady land cover types. Overall, the RRF due to gradual albedo variation varied from 0.0005 to 0.0170 W/m2, and the RRF due to LCC variation varied from 0.0037 to 0.0243 W/m2 during the years 2001 to 2019. The positive RRF caused by gradual albedo variation or the LCC can strengthen the warming effects in the TP. The impact of the gradual albedo variations occurring in the steady land cover types was very low between 2001 and 2019 because the time series was short, and it therefore cannot be neglected when examining radiative forcing for a long time series regarding climate change. © 2020, by the authors.","Inter-annual variations; Land surface albedo; LST; MODIS; NDVI; Radiative forcing; Snow cover; Tibetan Plateau","Atmospheric radiation; Budget control; Land surface temperature; Radiometers; Snow; Solar radiation; Surface measurement; Time series; Climate change rules; Global climate changes; Interannual variation; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Mountainous terrain; Normalized difference vegetation index; Seasonal variability; Spatiotemporal variability; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084265570

A climate-based ecological model may provide an effective alternative to the traditional approach for assessing limitations, thresholds, and the potential distribution of forests. The main objective of this study is to develop such a model, with a machine-learning approach based on scale-free climate variable estimates and classified vegetation plots, to generate a fine-scale predicted vegetation map of Taiwan, a subtropical mountainous island. Location: Taiwan. Methods: A total of 3,824 plots from 13 climate-related forest types and 57 climatic variable estimates for each plot were used to build an individual ecological niche model for each forest type with random forest (RF). A predicted vegetation map was developed through the assemblage of RF predictions for each forest type at the spatial resolution of 100 m. The accuracy of the ensemble RF model was evaluated by comparing the predicted forest type with its original classification by plot. Results: The climate environment of regions higher than 100 m above sea level in Taiwan was classified into potential habitats of 13 forest types by using model predictions. The predicted vegetation map displays a distinct altitudinal zonation from subalpine to montane cloud forests, followed by the latitudinal differentiation of subtropical mountain forests in the north and tropical montane forests in the south, with an average mismatch rate of 6.59%. An elevational profile and 3D visualization demonstrate the excellence of the model in estimating a fine, precise, and topographically corresponding potential distribution of forests. Conclusions: The machine-learning approach is effective for handling a large number of variables and to provide accurate predictions. This study provides a statistical procedure integrating two sources of training data: (a) the locations of field sampling plots; and (b) their corresponding climate variable estimates, to predict the potential distribution of climate-related forests. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science","climate; eastern Asia; ecological niche modeling; montane forest; random forest; subtropical forest; Taiwan; vegetation mapping",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081245150

However, greenhouse gas emissions from mangrove soils may reduce the capacity of carbon storage in these systems. In this study, methane (CH4) fluxes and soil properties of the top 10 cm layer were determined in subtropical (Kandelia obovata) and tropical (Avicennia marina) mangrove ecosystems of Taiwan for a complete seasonal cycle. Our results demonstrate that CH4 emissions in mangroves cannot be neglected when constructing the carbon budgets and estimating the carbon storage capacity. CH4 fluxes were significantly higher in summer than in winter in the Avicennia mangroves. However, no seasonal variation in CH4 flux was observed in the Kandelia mangroves. CH4 fluxes were significantly higher in the mangrove soils of Avicennia than in the adjoining mudflats; this trend, however, was not necessarily recapitulated at Kandelia. The results of multiple regression analyses show that soil water and organic matter content were the main factors regulating the CH4 fluxes in the Kandelia mangroves. However, none of the soil parameters assessed show a significant influence on the CH4 fluxes in the Avicennia mangroves. Since pneumatophores can transport CH4 from anaerobic deep soils, this study suggests that the pneumatophores of Avicennia marina played a more important role than soil properties in affecting soil CH4 fluxes. Our results show that different mangrove tree species and related root structures may affect greenhouse gas emissions from the soils. © 2020 by the authors.","Avicennia marina; Greenhouse gas; Kandelia obovata; Methane; Pneumatophore; Soil","Budget control; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Plants (botany); Regression analysis; Soil moisture; Tropics; Carbon budgets; Mangrove ecosystems; Methane emissions; Multiple regression analysis; Organic matter content; Root structure; Seasonal variation; Soil parameters; Forestry; aquatic ecosystem; carbon cycle; carbon emission; mangrove; methane; organic matter; regression analysis; soil water; subtropical region; tropical environment; Cost Control; Ecosystems; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Regression Analysis; Tropics; Taiwan; Avicennia; Avicennia marina; Kandelia; Kandelia obovata; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084663415

However, there is wide variation in reported sediment carbon stocks (Cstocks) across different global regions and between meadows composed of different seagrass species. Therefore, understanding the drivers for sediment Cstocks variation is crucial to developing effective conservation and restoration projects for seagrass ecosystems. This study analyses the influence of environmental factors on the variation in sediment Cstocks for six intertidal seagrass meadows within the Solent region, in southern England. There were significant differences between sites for all variables, except leaf density, and concentrations of the sediment pore water nutrients. Sediment dry bulk density, mean grain size, sorting coefficient, % mud, elevation above sea level, and pore water salinity showed high levels of association with Cstocks when assessed individually. Multivariate analyses showed that sediment dry bulk density, sorting coefficient, % mud, and pore water pH and concentration of nutrients greatly influenced Cstock. Moreover, sediment characteristics acted in conjunction to explain most of the variation in Cstock among sites. Therefore, sediment characteristics should be considered as important indicators for carbon storage potential in intertidal temperate seagrass meadows. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blue carbon; Intertidal; Seagrass; Sediment carbon stocks; Temperate","carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation planning; environmental effect; porewater; seagrass meadow; sediment chemistry; sorting; temperate environment; England; Solent; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077044792

The integrated optimization network in this contribution addresses the following aspects: (1) biogas supply-demand distribution network, (2) hydrogen production technology allocation involving steam methane reforming and electrolysis, (3) carbon dioxide allocation, and (4) utilization of external resources. The proposed framework is mathematically expressed as a mixed-integer linear programming problem to minimize total annual cost which will be solved by graphical optimization approach, P-graph.

Feasible configuration for meeting base hydrogen demand (7200 tons H2/year) has been proposed with total annual cost of 75,772,460 US $/year. Apart from base hydrogen demand, the developed model is verified with the increase of hydrogen demand for 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%.

However, their measurement devices or instruments are usually expensive and complicated operations are required, so a simple and effective way for measuring the PM2.5 concentration is needed. To relieve this problem, this paper attempts to provide an easy alternative approach to PM2.5 concentration estimation. The proposed approach is based on image processing schemes and a simple linear regression model. It uses images with a high and low PM2.5 concentration to obtain the difference between these images. The difference is applied to find the region with the greatest impact. The approach is described in two stages. First, a series of image processing schemes are employed to automatically select the region of interest (RoI) for PM2.5 concentration estimation. Through the selected RoI, a single feature is obtained. Second, by employing the single feature, a simple linear regression model is used and applied to PM2.5 concentration estimation. The proposed approach is verified by the real-world open data released by Taiwan’s government. The proposed scheme is not expected to replace component analysis using physical or chemical techniques. We have tried to provide a cheaper and easier way to conduct PM2.5 estimation with an acceptable performance more efficiently. To achieve this, further work will be conducted and is summarized at the end of this paper. © 2020 by the authors.

Distribution and collection of agricultural crops can be challenging duties as world demand and production are substantially increased. Accordingly, resource depletion, environmental concern, and the importance of the circular economy have convinced this research group to focus on a Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) network design. In this study, a new mixed linear mathematical model for a CLSC was developed which minimizes the CLSC's total costs and which tackles and controls air pollution. Contrary to previous works about supply chain network design, we firstly consider citrus fruits’ crates in our model. To solve the model, two leading algorithms, Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing, are employed and a third recently successful method, Keshtel Algorithm, is utilized. Further, two hybridization algorithms stemmed from mentioned ones are applied. Finally, the results are assessed by different criteria and compared, and then the two best algorithms are chosen in this case. Consequently, in order to achieve the most effective result, a real case study of crates was conducted. The results obviously presented applicability and efficiency of the proposed model. Thus, the most suitable network for CLSC of citrus fruits’ crates was designed in which the costs and emissions were reduced. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Citrus fruit crates; Closed-loop supply Chain; Environmental issues; Location-allocation problem; Metaheuristics; Reverse logistics","Crops; Genetic algorithms; Simulated annealing; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Environmental issues; Location allocation problem; Meta heuristics; Reverse logistics; Citrus fruits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081660737

Understanding the influence of climate change on sugarcane planting patterns and their suitability is conducive to the strategic decisions related to future agricultural adaptation. In this study, based on climatic resources and climate hazard indexes, a new climatic suitability index of sugarcane (CSIS) was established. A CSIS of the current climate period (1981–2010) was proposed for investigating the present planting pattern of sugarcane based on historical climate observations. We also projected the future changes in the CSIS and discussed the variation in the planting patterns of sugarcane in the middle of the 21st century (2020–2050) and the end of the 21st century (2071–2100) under the RCP4.5 scenario using projection data from the CMIP5. The regions with a CSIS&gt;0.2 had influence on sugarcane planting. The results of the CSIS in the current climate period showed that sugarcane is distributed in areas with a CSIS ≥ 0.2, while areas with the highest sugarcane yield correspond to areas with a CSIS ≥ 0.6. The areas of sugarcane planting in China can be classified into three grades: plantable area (0.2 ≤ CSIS &lt; 0.4), suitable area (0.4 ≤ CSIS &lt; 0.6) and optimal area (CSIS ≥ 0.6). In the middle 21st century, suitable sugarcane planting area grades showed an increase under the projection of the RCP4.5 scenario. The plantable area was extended to the south of Shandong Province and the north bank of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, mainly because the frost hazard was alleviated and the heat index increased. In addition to the increase in heat conditions, an increase in total solar radiation was also found to play a role in the expansion of suitable areas in Chongqing in western China. The optimal area covers southern China, Jiangxi and southern Hunan in central China and eastern Zhejiang in eastern China.

In this study, we compiled SOC stock change data as influenced by tillage practices, i.e. no-till (NT) versus conventional tillage (CT), on agricultural soils in Canada. We determined the rate of C change as a function of soil texture and climate stratified by time since the management change. In the cool and humid climates of Eastern Canada, the impacts of NT were inconsistent and resulted in a decline in C storage rate in the years shortly following management change, but SOC recovered over time. Carbon losses were particularly high on fine and coarse textured soils, whereas in medium textured soils NT tended to increase SOC. On the Canadian prairies NT consistently increased SOC. The rate of gain in SOC under NT decreased over time with higher rates in the 3−10 years following a change to NT at a rate of 740 kg C ha−1 yr−1 or 1.3 % yr−1. Rates declined to 260 kg C ha−1 yr−1 or 0.87 % yr−1 for periods from 11–20 years after tillage change, and to 95 kg C ha-1 yr−1 or 0.23 % for periods longer than 20 years. The results of this work clearly show climate, soil texture and duration of management as main drivers of SOC change under NT in Canada and key factors that must be considered in the development of either national or regional SOC models. The results of this study suggest that more detailed stratification of soil texture, climate and duration of NT adoption is required for more accurate estimates of SOC storage rates associated with NT for Canada. © 2019","C sequestration; Soil organic carbon; Soil texture; Tillage","Climate models; Cultivation; Digital storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Soils; Textures; C sequestration; Coarse-textured soils; Conventional tillage; Mitigation measures; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic carbon storages; Soil textures; Tillage; Climate change; agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; greenhouse gas; organic carbon; soil organic matter; soil texture; stratification; tillage; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077730927

However, it has been unclear how structure and functions of the global carbon transfers evolve in terms of a complex network. Therefore, this study applies a series of network tools to depict the evolution features of the global carbon flow network from 1995 to 2011 as supported by a systems multi-regional input-output analysis. At global level, the network density increases essentially, indicating the widely expanding carbon leakages among economies. The increasingly distinct scale-free distribution for cumulative degree/weighted degree implies the network's intensified heterogeneity structure. At regional level, a new tripartite cluster structure has been identified by the three gradually stabilized communities centered on USA, China and Europe. At national level, the evolution for all economies' roles, especially two prominent groups (i.e. G8 and BRICS), is enunciated by coreness in context of the core-periphery structure, highlighting the significance of monitoring core economies' carbon emission flows. The results urge the need to shift from local carbon mitigation in silos to global collective and inclusive governance. Regional cluster structure's identification highlights the urgency for multinational cooperation on emission mitigation within the three newly formulated communities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon leakage; Global carbon emissions; International trade; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Network analysis","Complex networks; Electric network analysis; International trade; Public policy; Carbon emission flows; Carbon flow networks; Carbon leakage; Global carbon emission; Input output analysis; Multinational cooperations; Scale-free distributions; Structural evolution; Carbon; carbon emission; core-periphery relations; emissions trading; global economy; input-output analysis; international trade; network analysis; pollution policy; China; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078822729

We analyzed the amount of CO2 transfers by the two countries caused by final consumption and its structural distribution from 1993 to 2013. We identified the key domestic and foreign sectors and transfer paths among the sectors that contributed most to final consumption. The total consumption-based transfer quantity increased to 1.2 and 3.6 times the 1993 value for the United States and China, respectively, whose domestic production and consumption were around 75 and 90% of the total, respectively. The key domestic sectors in both countries were the Electricity, Gas, and Water sector, the Transportation sector, and the Petroleum, Chemical, and Non-Metallic Mineral Products sector, which each accounted for 20–30% of the total. Among the domestic transfer paths, the American Electricity, Gas, and Water sector and Transportation sector, and China's Construction sector, had the most connections to other sectors. We identified frequent contributions of foreign sectors to final consumption in both countries. Their dominant transfers were to the American Public Administration sector and Education, Health, and Other Services sector, and to China's Construction sector. Understanding these key sectors and the paths among them can provide the scientific basis for improved national emission mitigation plans. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; CO2 transfer; Final consumption; Industrial contribution; Industrial transfer path; United States","Construction industry; Greenhouse gases; Motor transportation; Petroleum transportation; Public administration; Regression analysis; China; CO2 transfer; Final consumption; Industrial contribution; Industrial transfers; United States; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076512445

However, past efficiency analyses have tended to discuss energy efficiency and environmental efficiency separately, or have discussed ways in which governments can reduce pollution at the source. In other words, previous analyses of China's energy efficiency have only been focused on one-stage, and very few studies have integrated the environment, government pollution reductions, and economic development in the analysis. Therefore, to fill this research gap, this study examined the first and second-stage energy and air pollution reduction efficiencies in thirty Chinese provinces and municipalities from 2013 to 2016 using a dynamic, network slack-based measure (DNSBM) model, in which labor, fixed assets and energy consumption were the input variables in the first production stage, GDP was the output variable, and CO2, SO2, and NO2 emissions were the link variables, and in the second treatment stage, pollution treatment investment was the input variable, the CO2, SO2, and NO2 emissions reductions were the output variables, and energy consumption/GDP was the carryover variable. It was found that; (1) Beijing, Shanghai, Guizhou, Hainan and Qinghai had the best performances over the 4 years, and Shaanxi, Shandong, Fujian, Jilin, Liaoning and Xinjiang had the worst performances and therefore had the greatest need for improvements; (2) the overall provincial efficiencies were generally relatively low and significant improvements were needed however, there were large differences between the provinces/municipalities; (3) the overall air pollution reduction efficiency governance in the second stage was low, indicating that more effective measures were needed to improve environmental efficiency and that the dynamic developments in government regulations and governance had resulted in a policy implementation lag; and (4) in 21 provinces, the first-stage productivity was significantly higher than the second-stage treatment productivity, indicating that the treatment stage needed to be strengthened. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutant emissions reduction; CO2; Dynamic and network SBM (DNSBM); Treatment","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental regulations; Investments; Nitrogen oxides; Productivity; Public policy; Air pollutant emission; Economic development; Environmental efficiency; Environmental pollutions; Government regulation; Policy implementations; Slack-based measures; Treatment; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076460123

Although its effect on air quality improvement has been witnessed and evaluated, its influence on employment, which determines the overall desirability and efficiency of the policy, has remained unaddressed with reliable empirical evidence. We provide causal estimates of the aggregate effect of the Clean Air Action, one of the largest and most recent environmental programs in China, on labor demand. Utilizing the cross-city variations in regulatory stringency measured by the air quality targets, we adopt the difference-in-differences propensity score matching method to estimate the effect. We find that during the program's first two years, the Clean Air Action did not bring significant negative impacts on economy-wide employment or labor demand in the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors. It also did not reduce employment in the more disaggregated sectors of mining, manufacturing, and utilities supply. These findings are robust across different econometric specifications. To explain our results, we examine the output effect and the substitution effect, and find that on the aggregate levels, the Action did not cause significant changes in the inputs of labor and capital as well as the elasticity of substitution but led to a significant drop in the total output. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed. Our study empirically reveals that the short-term negative impacts on the macro economy from the latest air pollution regulation in China are characterized by output reduction rather than employment shocks. It also potentially contributes to the timely evaluation of the causal effects of environmental policies in China and provides evidence-based suggestions for the adjustment of the ongoing regulation to achieve higher social welfare. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; China; Environmental regulation; Labor demand; Policy evaluation","air quality; atmospheric pollution; demand analysis; employment; pollution control; air pollution; air quality; article; China; economic aspect; elasticity; employment; environmental policy; human; mining; propensity score; social welfare; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078655034

In the coastal oceans, carbonate system dynamics are controlled by numerous processes such as land-derived inputs, biological activity, and coastal water dynamics, and seasonal alkalinity variations can play an important role in the regional carbon cycle. However, our understanding of these variations on the East China Sea (ECS) shelf remains poor due to limited observations. In order to estimate and investigate the seasonal variability of AT on the ECS shelf, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed using five cruise datasets from 2008 to 2018. The model used temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen to estimate AT with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ∼7 umol kg–1, and was applied to calculate AT for eight cruises during 2013–2016. In addition, monthly water column AT for the period 2000–2016 was obtained using temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen from the Changjiang Biology Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) Data. Spatial distributions, seasonal cycles and correlations of surface AT indicated that the seasonal fluctuation of the Changjiang River discharge is the major factor affecting seasonal variation of surface AT on the ECS shelf. The largest seasonal fluctuations of surface AT were found on the inner shelf near the Changjiang Estuary, which is under the influence of the Changjiang River discharge. © Copyright © 2020 Li, Bellerby, Wallhead, Ge, Liu, Liu and Yang.","artificial neural network; Changjiang River discharge; East China Sea shelf; seasonal variability; total alkalinity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083877127

However, with the increasingly strict regulations on VOC emissions, the traditional condensation method cannot meet the requirements of the existing VOC emission standards due to its restriction of the refrigeration temperature. In this paper, a novel VOC deep condensation recovery system (VOC-DCR system) is designed to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional condensation recovery system, and its steady-state simulation shows that the VOC recovery rate is 99.97% and the energy consumption is 35.67 kW. In addition, the VOC emission concentration after the treatment of the novel system is 45.17 mg/Nm3, which is far below the emission limit. Moreover, to verify the security and effectiveness of the actual running of the system, the dynamic model of the system is established to study its dynamic behaviours under external disturbances. The dynamic simulation results show that the novel system can overcome some disturbances and operate in a stable state. On this basis, this paper also predicts the operational risk of the system under extreme disturbances of −50% to 50%. The prediction results show that in order to ensure the safe and effective operation of the system, the disturbance of feed temperature and flow rate should be controlled within −33% to 8% and −2% to 8% respectively. Moreover, the disturbance of feed pressure and concentration should be controlled within −8% to 50% and −50% to 18% respectively. The conclusions of this study are of great significance for promoting the industrial application of the VOC-DCR system and guiding its safe operation. © 2020","Deep condensation process; Dynamic behaviour; Risk prediction; VOCs","Air quality; Dynamic response; Energy utilization; Recovery; Volatile organic compounds; Condensation process; Design and dynamics; Dynamic behaviours; Emission of volatile organic compounds; External disturbances; Refrigeration temperatures; Risk predictions; Steady-state simulations; Condensation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080106845

Generating accurate climate prediction at finer spatial resolution through downscaling could help better assess the future effects of climate change on a local scale. Ensembles of multiple climate models have been proven to improve the accuracy of temperature prediction. Meanwhile, machine learning techniques have shown high performance in solving various predictive modeling problems, which make them a promising tool for temperature downscaling. This study investigated the performance of machine learning (long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and support vector machine (SVM)) and statistical (arithmetic ensemble mean (EM) and multiple linear regression (MLR)) methods in developing multi-model ensembles for downscaling long-term daily temperature. A case study of twelve meteorological stations across Ontario, Canada, was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed ensembles. The results showed that both machine learning and statistical techniques performed well at downscaling daily temperature with multi-model ensembles and had similar performance with relatively high accuracy. The R2 of 12 stations ranged between 0.756 and 0.820 and RMSE ranged between 4.318 and 7.063 °C.

The potential amount of CO2 that can be removed from the atmosphere depends, among others, on the yields of bioenergy crops, the land available to grow these crops and the efficiency with which CO2 produced by combustion is captured. While bioenergy crop yields can be simulated by models, estimates of the spatial distribution of bioenergy yields under current technology based on a large number of observations are currently lacking. In this study, a random-forest (RF) algorithm is used to upscale a bioenergy yield dataset of 3963 observations covering Miscanthus, switchgrass, eucalypt, poplar and willow using climatic and soil conditions as explanatory variables. The results are global yield maps of five important lignocellulosic bioenergy crops under current technology, climate and atmospheric CO2 conditions at a 0:5 0:5 spatial resolution. We also provide a combined ""best bioenergy crop"" yield map by selecting one of the five crop types with the highest yield in each of the grid cells, eucalypt and Miscanthus in most cases. The global median yield of the best crop is 16.3 tDMha1 yr1 (DM dry matter). High yields mainly occur in the Amazon region and southeastern Asia. We further compare our empirically derived maps with yield maps used in three IAMs and find that the median yields in our maps are 50% higher than those in the IAM maps. Our estimates of gridded bioenergy crop yields can be used to provide bioenergy yields for IAMs, to evaluate land surface models or to identify the most suitable lands for future bioenergy crop plantations.

Here, a fossil pollen record of annually-varved core from Sugan Lake in interior Qaidam Basin was quantitatively analyzed to reconstruct changes in vegetation, floristic diversity and drought frequency. Results of biomization suggested that regional vegetation was desert vegetation with three short-term occupations of temperate steppe/xerophytic shrub during the last 2700 years. Floristic diversity generally increased/decreased with the expansion/degradation of desert vegetation. Moisture fluctuations showed three distinct stages (extremely dry between 742BC and ∼AD500, relatively wet with an increasing trend between ∼AD500 and 1200 and relatively wet with frequent fluctuations after AD1200), interrupted by 14 drought events. Spectral analysis and continuous wavelet transform of moisture variation revealed 200- and 120-year cycles. According to cross-wavelet transform analysis, major drought frequency of ∼200-year was explicitly correlated to solar activity. It’s suggested that the centennial-scale drought frequency was mainly driven by solar activity, through modulation of large-scale atmospheric circulation. Furthermore, the effect of surface temperature-evaporation and uplifting/subsiding air flow should be notable. The climatic drought in interior Qaidam Basin could be intensified under the continuous global warming. © 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Drought frequency; Northeastern Tibetan Plateau; Pollen; Qaidam Basin; Vegetation change","Global warming; Landforms; Moisture; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Spectrum analysis; Vegetation; Wavelet transforms; Atmospheric circulation; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Cross-wavelet transform; Northeastern tibetan plateaux; Pollen; Qaidam basin; Surface temperatures; Vegetation change; Drought; desert; drought; floristics; fossil record; frequency analysis; pollen; quantitative analysis; solar radiation; vegetation; China; Qaidam Basin; Qinghai; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Sugan Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077555422

Given that lake CH4 emissions involve multiple, complex processes influenced by various environmental factors, estimates of global lake CH4 emissions are largely uncertain. In this study, we compiled global CH4 emission data on 744 lakes from published studies, and found a significantly negative correlation (R2 = 0.50, p &lt; 0.01) between diffusive CH4 flux and lake maximum depth. Further analysis indicated that no significant differences in global sediment CH4 production were found for the different maximum depths investigated. Owing to the longer oxidation pathway, presence of oxycline layer, and the lower nutrient environment, deeper lakes yield less diffusive CH4 efflux compared to shallower lakes. Additionally, we also found that lake area was negatively correlated (R2 = 0.13, p &lt; 0.01) to diffusive CH4 flux. Therefore, based on empirical correlations between lake morphometry (maximum depth and area) and diffusive CH4 emission, as well as the combination of two lake databases, we estimated that the annual diffusive CH4 emission from global lakes is approximately 11.2 (6.2–19.5) Tg CH4/yr, and greater than 84% is emitted from lakes with a mean depth of less than 5 m. Furthermore, two regions, 40–70° N (30.4%) and 20° S∼10° N (37.4%), were found to be the dominant contributors of global lake diffusive CH4 emissions, resulting from the considerable total lake area and the extensive shallow lakes in these regions. This study highlights the significance of the ‘depth-effect’ which controls the spatial distribution of lake diffusive CH4 flux and allows for the quantification of global lake diffusive CH4 emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Freshwaters GHGs emissions; Global methane estimation; Lake CH4 diffusion; Maximum depth; Surface area","Greenhouse gases; Methane; Empirical correlations; Environmental factors; GHGs emissions; Maximum depth; Methane emissions; Negative correlation; Oxidation pathway; Surface area; Lakes; methane; emission; environmental factor; greenhouse gas; lacustrine environment; methane; oxidation; pollutant source; spatial distribution; surface area; temperature effect; air pollution; Article; atmospheric transport; concentration (parameter); data base; diffusion; environmental factor; lake; lake sediment; nutrient; oxidation; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077975208

Through a systematic review of the national policy documents, this study investigates the policy mix adopted by the Chinese government to facilitate its energy transition and how that policy mix has evolved between 1981 and 2020. The chronological analysis emphasizes two dimensions of temporal changes in the policy mix: (1) changes in the policy intensity and density, and (2) the shift in policy instrument combinations. The policy mix has evolved from a few authority-based instruments to the current response that has a large density of instruments with a good diversity of instrument types. The Chinese government imposes an increasing policy intensity on air pollution abatement and a decreasing policy intensity on renewable energy support, and experiments with innovative policy instruments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The evolutionary trajectory features layering new policy instruments, calibrating existing ones and some degree of policy replacement and sequencing. Overall, the study shows that the Chinese government has adopted a complex mix of policy instruments to abate emissions (e.g. carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide) in the coal-based energy system and to support renewable energy technologies.

Then we explored the CEE differences and characteristics of different regions obtained by using hierarchical clustering of each province's CEE. Finally, based on the regression model, we conducted an empirical analysis of the impact of each factor of total factor productivity (TFP) on CEE. The main findings of this research are as follows: (1) The industrial structure, energy structure, government regulation, technological innovation, and openness had a significant impact on CEE; (2) The variation trends of CEE and TFP in the eight regions we studied were convergent, while the variations of CEE among regions were diverse and all distributed stably in different ranges; (3) The eight regions' efficiency basically showed a downward trend of eastern, central and western China; (4) Technological regression was the main reason for the decline in TFP.

Anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) mediate this process through the coupling of methane oxidation to different electron acceptors, or in concert with a syntrophic bacterial partner. Recently, ANME belonging to the archaeal family Methanoperedenaceae (formerly known as ANME-2d) were shown to be capable of AOM coupled to nitrate and iron reduction. Here, a freshwater sediment bioreactor fed with methane and Mn(IV) oxides (birnessite) resulted in a microbial community dominated by two novel members of the Methanoperedenaceae, with biochemical profiling of the system demonstrating Mn(IV)-dependent AOM. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed the expression of key genes involved in methane oxidation and several shared multiheme c-type cytochromes (MHCs) that were differentially expressed, indicating the likely use of different extracellular electron transfer pathways. We propose the names “Candidatus Methanoperedens manganicus” and “Candidatus Methanoperedens manganireducens” for the two newly described Methanoperedenaceae species. This study demonstrates the ability of members of the Methanoperedenaceae to couple AOM to the reduction of Mn(IV) oxides, which suggests their potential role in linking methane and manganese cycling in the environment. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"anaerobic digestion; bioreactor; cytochrome; freshwater sediment; gene expression; manganese; methane; microbial community; oxidation; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); manganese; methane; nitric acid derivative; anaerobic growth; archaeon; bacterium; bioreactor; bioremediation; genetics; metabolism; Methanosarcinales; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; sediment; Anaerobiosis; Archaea; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Geologic Sediments; Manganese; Methane; Methanosarcinales; Nitrates; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078489509

Because of its high stability, CO2-activation/fixation represents a true challenge for chemists. Autotrophic microbial communities, however, perform these reactions under standard temperature and pressure. Recent discoveries shine light on autotrophic acetogenic bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, as these anaerobes use a particularly efficient CO2-capture system to fulfill their carbon and energy needs. While other autotrophs assimilate CO2 via carboxylation followed by a reduction, acetogens and methanogens do the opposite. They first generate formate and CO by CO2-reduction, which are subsequently fixed to funnel the carbon toward their central metabolism. Yet their CO2-reduction pathways, with acetate or methane as end-products, constrain them to thrive at the “thermodynamic limits of Life”. Despite this energy restriction acetogens and methanogens are growing at unexpected fast rates. To overcome the thermodynamic barrier of CO2-reduction they apply different ingenious chemical tricks such as the use of flavin-based electron-bifurcation or coupled reactions. This mini-review summarizes the current knowledge gathered on the CO2-fixation strategies among acetogens. While extensive biochemical characterization of the acetogenic formate-generating machineries has been done, there is no structural data available. Based on their shared mechanistic similarities, we apply the structural information obtained from hydrogenotrophic methanogens to highlight common features, as well as the specific differences of their CO2-fixation systems. We discuss the consequences of their CO2-reduction strategies on the evolution of Life, their wide distribution and their impact in biotechnological applications. © Copyright © 2020 Lemaire, Jespersen and Wagner.","acetogenic bacteria; biotechnology; CO2-fixation; coupled reaction; evolution; formate dehydrogenase; hydrogenotrophic methanogens","acetate coenzyme A ligase; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; Acetogen; anaerobic bacterium; biotechnological production; carbon dioxide fixation; carbon metabolism; carbon reduction; electron bifurcation; energy metabolism; extremophile; methanogen; methanogenesis; nonhuman; reduction (chemistry); Review; thermodynamics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083514369

In agricultural growing regions, alterations in climate can challenge plant productivity in ways that impact the ability of the world to sustain adequate food production for a growing and increasingly affluent population with shifting access to affordable and nutritious food. While the knowledge gap that exists regarding potential climate change impacts is large across agriculture, it is especially large in specialty cropping systems. This includes fruit and vegetable crops, and perennial cropping systems which also contribute (along with row crops) to our global diet. In order to obtain a comprehensive view of the true impact of climate change on our global food supply, we must expand our narrow focus from improving yield and plant productivity to include the impact of climate change on the nutritional value of these crops. In order to address these questions, we need a multi-faceted approach that integrates physiology and genomics tools and conducts comprehensive experiments under realistic depictions of future projected climate. This review describes gaps in our knowledge in relation to these responses, and future questions and actions that are needed to develop a sustainable future food supply in light of global climate change. © 2020 The Author(s)","Climate change; Fruit and vegetable crops; Genomics; Perennial crops; Physiology; Plant nutritional quality","agriculture; catering service; climate change; crop; diet; fruit; genomics; nutritional value; procedures; vegetable; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Diet; Food Supply; Fruit; Genomics; Nutritive Value; Phenomics; Vegetables",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078721154

Air quality prediction is a very effective means of predicting air pollution in the future, which helps the government regulatory authorities to provide early warning and protect people's physical and mental health. In this paper, a prediction model of air pollutant concentration based on deep neural network is proposed. With the concentration of PM2.5 as the prediction target, the neural network chooses bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and fully connected neural network. First, historical meteorological data and the PM2.5 density from 2016 to 2017 were used as training data in this paper, which were obtained from website. Then, after pre-processing the input data, the data is transmitted to the network and trained multiple times to obtain network parameters that make the prediction effect better. Next, the network model is applied to the test set, and the test results are compared with the actual values to measure the prediction effect. Finally, by comparing with other prediction models, the results show that the proposed model performs better and has higher accuracy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air quality; Data handling; Deep neural networks; Environmental protection; Forecasting; Meteorology; Air pollutant concentrations; Air quality prediction; Fully connected neural network; Liaoning Province; Meteorological data; Network parameters; Prediction model; Regulatory authorities; Long short-term memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083262672

Herein, we newly introduce a simple electrospray pyrolysis method to take advantage of a facile wet-chemical synthesis applicable on non-copper substrates, such as a porous carbon paper, and demonstrate highly enhanced selectivity for C2H4 production from CO2RR. The electrosprayed copper oxide on the carbon paper showed uniquely improved C2 selectivity compared with that on the copper substrate. The improved performance is proposed to be related to the presence of Cu mixed state and retention of morphology of the electrosprayed catalyst on the carbon paper, showing the importance of the substrate. In addition, the C2 product selectivity can be tuned by the electrospray synthesis time as it affects the size of the surface nanostructure as well as the porosity of the catalyst, which can provide an effective way to regulate the C2/C1 ratio. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Copper oxides; Ethylene; Morphology; Paper; Porous materials; Reduction; Substrates; Bulk substrates; Copper substrates; Electrospray pyrolysis; Electrosprayed catalyst; Product selectivities; Surface nanostructure; Synthesis time; Wet chemical synthesis; Catalyst selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082746488

The results show that centralized population and mezzo scale jobs-housing balance as well as higher UA population density can significantly reduce VMT and CO2 emissions. The combined effects of all UA level variables, including population-weighted density (PWD), are found to be on par with the elasticity of VMT with regard to a census tract level compactness index. Further, we find that urban spatial structure moderates local urban form effects on travel behavior. For example, while 10% more compact census tracts are associated with 5% fewer VMT in UAs with the sample average PWD, such as St. Louis and Pittsburgh, this estimated local effect increases to 7.5% and 10% in UAs where PWD is as high as in Chicago and New York, respectively.

Using a difference-in-differences analysis, I show that U.S. states which adopt electricity market liberalization laws are subsequently fifteen to forty-three percentage points more likely to adopt a renewable portfolio standard and fifteen to thirty percentage points more likely to adopt a cap-and-trade program. I argue that the forced reduction in market share of incumbent utilities associated with market liberalization laws undermined the political dominance of legacy producers and facilitated the growth of independent power producers (IPPs). Following liberalization, I show how these firms disproportionately benefited from the development of renewable energy, and how their growth in market share corresponded with a rise in political activity, thus offering a countervailing industrial interest-group influence to legacy producers. These findings demonstrate the importance of industrial organization in shaping long-run prospects for climate mitigation.

Energy system planning and operation requires more accurate forecasts of intermittent renewable energy resources that consider the impact of battery degradation on the system caused by the accumulation of charging and discharging cycles. In this study, a statistical model is presented for forecasting a day-ahead photovoltaic (PV) generation considering solar radiation and weather parameters. In addition, the technical performance of energy storage systems (ESS) should be evaluated by considering battery degradation that occurs during the charge and discharge cycles of the battery. In this study, a battery degradation model based on the data-driven method is used. Based on a suitable forecasting model, ESS scheduling is performed to charge the maximum amount of PV generation and discharge for the self-consumption of the customer load when PV generation ends. Since the battery is highly dependent on operating conditions such as depth of discharge, state of charge and temperature, two different ESS charge and discharge modes are proposed. From the simulation with the battery degradation model using parameters derived from experiments, we show that the battery is degraded along with charging cycles during testing periods. Variations in state of health are observed owing to the different characteristics of the battery according to the ESS operation modes, which are divided into the low and high SOC. Through experimental validation, it is proved that the state of charge (SOC), 0.45 is the optimal threshold that can determine the low and high SOC. Finally, the simulation results lead to the conclusion that the battery degradation in different operation modes should be taken into account to extend the end of life efficiently. © 2020 by the authors.

Spatially and temporally explicit estimates of life-cycle environmental impacts are therefore needed for suggesting location and time relevant environmental mitigations strategies. Emission factors and process-based mechanism models are popular approaches used to estimate life-cycle environmental impacts. However, emission factors are often incapable of describing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of agricultural emissions, whereas process-based mechanistic models, capable of capturing the heterogeneity, tend to be very complicated and time-consuming. Efficient prediction of life-cycle environmental impacts from agricultural production is lacking. This study develops a rapid predictive model to quantify life-cycle global warming (GW) and eutrophication (EU) impacts of corn production using a novel machine learning approach. We used the boosted regression tree (BRT) model to estimate future life-cycle environmental impacts of corn production in U.S. Midwest counties under four emissions scenarios for years 2022–2100. Results from BRT models indicate that the cross-validation (R2) for predicting life cycle GW and EU impacts ranged from 0.78 to 0.82, respectively. Furthermore, results show that future life-cycle GW and EU impacts of corn production will increase in magnitude under all four emissions scenarios, with the highest environmental impacts shown under the high-emissions scenario. Moreover, this study found that changes in precipitation and temperature played a significant role in influencing the spatial heterogeneity in all life-cycle impacts across Midwest counties. The BRT model results indicate that machine learning can be a useful tool for predicting spatially and temporally explicit future life-cycle environmental impacts associated with corn production under different climate scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Corn production; Environmental impacts; Life cycle assessment; Machine learning; US Midwest","Climate change; Climate models; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Forecasting; Global warming; Learning systems; Machine learning; Agricultural productions; Corn production; Environmental mitigation; Future climate scenarios; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle environmental impact; Machine learning approaches; Spatial and temporal heterogeneity; Life cycle; climate change; climate effect; crop production; environmental impact assessment; future prospect; life cycle analysis; machine learning; maize; article; climate change; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; machine learning; plant yield; precipitation; prediction; quantitative analysis; cross validation; Midwest; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078553319

Recent recorded decreases in body size of endotherms have been attributed to climate change in some cases. This prediction is based on the trend of smaller body size of endotherms in warmer climates (Bergmann’s rule) and it implies genetic responses rather than phenotypic flexibility. Alternatively, selection for smaller body size or lower mass could be explained by the starvation-predation hypothesis, where lighter individuals have a higher probability of escaping pursuing predators, such as raptors. Evidence that climate warming is driving patterns of size selection in birds in recent times has been mixed. We inspected data on 40 bird species contributed by bird ringers to the South African Ringing Scheme (SAFRING) for changes in body mass and condition as a function of time (year), minimum temperature of the day of capture, maximum temperature of the previous day, and rainfall data in the south-western Cape Floristic Region (fynbos) around Cape Town, South Africa, for the period 1988–2015. The region shows a warming trend over the study period (0.035 °C yr−1). Interannual body mass and condition change were poorly explained by year or temperature. High daily minimum temperature explained loss of body condition for four species, whereas evidence from recaptured birds indicated negative effects of increasing maximum daily temperature, as well as rain. For the alternative hypothesis, because raptor abundance is stable or only weakly declining, there is little evidence to suggest these as a driver influencing mass trends.

It is thus necessary to properly integrate those systems for the evaluation of the overall emissions to the receiving water. The integration of the sewer system and the WRRF, however, leaves us with multiple potential options to reduce these emissions. The proposed approach builds on previous research using global sensitivity analysis (GSA) as a screening method for available control handles. It considers parameter and input uncertainty to select control handles that generate large benefits even if the model differs from reality. Results from a real-life case study indicate that the three top-rated handles are comparably effective for all considered uncertainty and variability scenarios.

In particular, despite reducing levels of permitted emissions legislatively, such reductions have not been observed in the real world. In this work, NOx emissions from three vehicles-a Euro 5 car, a Euro V hybrid bus, and a Euro VI-bus have been measured in real driving conditions (and in the case of the buses-in full passenger service). A recently developed high spatio-temporal resolution technique combining very fast (10 ms) NOx measurement with differential GPS accurate to 1 cm allows these emissions to be resolved to a distance of less than 10 cm (worst-case-dependent on vehicle speed). The results show that acceleration events for the vehicles play a significant part in their total NOx emissions. In addition, standard events such as a speed bump and a bus stop are analysed. The temperature of any aftertreatment (catalytic converter) to reduce NOx emissions is also observed to be of substantial significance. At idle, the passenger car was observed to near-double its NOx emissions when the air conditioning was switched on. Finally, the real driving conditions are compared to the legislative compliance cycles for the certification of the buses, and those results used to further understand the observed NOx emissions. © 2020 by the authors.","Bus emissions; Diesel emissions; High spatial resolution; NOx; RDE","Air conditioning; Air quality; Buses; Diesel engines; After-treatment; Differential GPS; Legislative compliance; NOx emissions; Passenger service; Spatio-temporal resolution; Urban air quality; Vehicle speed; Nitrogen oxides; air quality; diesel engine; emission control; nitrogen oxides; traffic emission; urban atmosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084764673

Here, we develop a new modeling approach, CRAFT (CaRbon Accumulation in ForesTs) based on widely available input data to study the C dynamics in French forests at the regional scale from 1850 to 2015. The model is composed of two interconnected modules which integrate biomass stocks and flows (Module 1) with litter and soil organic C (Module 2) and build upon previously established coupled climate-vegetation models. Our model allows to develop a comprehensive understanding of forest C dynamics by systematically depicting the integrated impact of environmental changes and land use. Model outputs were compared to empirical data of C stocks in forest biomass and soils, available for recent decades from inventories, and to a long-term simulation using a bookkeeping model. The CRAFT model reliably simulates the C dynamics during France's forest transition and reproduces C-fluxes and stocks reported in the forest and soil inventories, in contrast to a widely used bookkeeping model which strictly only depicts C-fluxes due to wood extraction. Model results show that like in several other industrialized countries, a sharp increase in forest biomass and SOC stocks resulted from forest area expansion and, especially after 1960, from tree growth resulting in vegetation thickening (on average 7.8 Mt C/year over the whole period). The difference between the bookkeeping model, 0.3 Mt C/year in 1850 and 21 Mt C/year in 2015, can be attributed to environmental and land management changes. The CRAFT model opens new grounds for better quantifying long-term forest C dynamics and investigating the relative effects of land use, land management, and environmental change. © 2020 The Authors.

Application of the index is done with use of a long-term wave hindcast, validated database for the North Sea. A detailed overall and monthly wave resource assessment reveals that mean expected wave resource is ≈15 kW/m, with higher nearshore values in December-January ≈20-25 kW/m. Lower magnitudes are met in July with values closer to ≈ 4-6 kW/m, as a general observation higher resource magnitude is expected at upper parts of the North Sea, with diminishing levels towards the English channel, the difference in available resource is almost half. The region favours “smaller” capacity devices for energy production, with capacity factors having encouraging results. The highest mean value for a capacity factor in the region is 25-32%, depending on device. However, the new index indicated that the highest capacity factor value should not be the determinant parameter. In fact, other locations have less energy production annnually, but exhibit significantly less variation in production patterns, and lower extreme values of return waves. © 2020 The Author","Capacity factor; Extreme values; North sea; Variability; Wave energy converter; Wave energy index","Ocean currents; Capacity factors; Extreme value; North Sea; Variability; Wave energy; Wave energy converters; Wave energy conversion; climate variation; database; hindcasting; index method; model validation; power generation; resource assessment; wave climate; wave energy; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079886475

We assessed the vulnerability to climate change of 993 terrestrial and coastal-marine Brazilian PAs by combining indicators of climatic-change hazard with indicators of PA resilience (size, native vegetation cover, and probability of climate-driven vegetation transition). This combination of indicators allows the identification of broad climate-change adaptation pathways. Seventeen PAs (20,611 km2) were highly vulnerable and located mainly in the Atlantic Forest (7 PAs), Cerrado (6), and the Amazon (4). Two hundred fifty-eight PAs (756,569 km2), located primarily in Amazonia, had a medium vulnerability. In the Amazon and western Cerrado, the projected severe climatic change and probability of climate-driven vegetation transition drove vulnerability up, despite the generally good conservation status of PAs. Over 80% of PAs of high or moderate vulnerability are managed by indigenous populations. Hence, besides the potential risks to biodiversity, the traditional knowledge and livelihoods of the people inhabiting these PAs may be threatened. In at least 870 PAs, primarily in the Atlantic Forest and Amazon, adaptation could happen with little or no intervention due to low climate-change hazard, high resilience status, or both. At least 20 PAs in the Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Amazonia should be targeted for stronger interventions (e.g., improvement of ecological connectivity), given their low resilience status. Despite being a first attempt to link vulnerability and adaptation in Brazilian PAs, we suggest that some of the PAs identified as highly or moderately vulnerable should be prioritized for testing potential adaptation strategies in the near future. © 2019 Society for Conservation Biology","biodiversity conservation; biome; Caatinga; indigenous land; Pantanal; regional climate-change index; sustainable use","adaptation; biodiversity; biome; caatinga; climate change; protected area; regional climate; sustainability; vegetation cover; vulnerability; Amazonia; Atlantic Forest; biodiversity; Brazil; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; human; Biodiversity; Brazil; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073971218

We report the deposition of a thin film of copper oxide onto a large-surface-area plasmonic silver structure, which generates an efficient photoelectrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. Using incoherent visible light illumination and applying -0.4 V versus Ag/AgCl(KCl 1M), CO2 was reduced to acetate with a faradaic efficiency of 54%. Rather than adding plasmonic nanoparticles as sensitizers onto semiconductors, here we electrodeposit a thin uniform layer of Cu2O/CuO over a plasmonic silver structure. The formation of acetate at this low potential has not been reported before and appears to arise from synergistic effects in this hybrid plasmonic-semiconductor material. In this work, we investigate changes in the photophysics under different preparation conditions. Varying the deposition time of Cu2O/CuO deposited onto the Ag to form the Ag/Cu2O/CuO electrodes alters electron-hole recombination. The Ag/Cu2O/CuO electrodes show the highest photocurrent density when a minimal Cu2O/CuO film covers the Ag structure. Synergistic effects between the localized surface plasmon resonance of silver and semiconductor properties of Cu2O/CuO decrease the necessary overpotential required for CO2 reduction, reduce charge recombination processes, and stabilize the Cu2O/CuO semiconductor on the photoelectrode. The stabilization of Cu2O/CuO in the presence of energetic charge carriers is believed to be key to producing acetate with high efficiency. These properties suggest an interesting approach to photoelectrocatalytic materials.

Currently, climate models have a low ability to simulate conditions forming the aerosol baseline; a major uncertainty comes from the lack of understanding of aerosol size distributions and their dynamics. Contrasting studies stress that primary sea salt aerosol can contribute significantly to the aerosol population, challenging the concept of climate biogenic regulation by new particle formation (NPF) from dimethyl sulfide marine emissions. We present a statistical cluster analysis of the physical characteristics of particle size distributions (PSDs) collected at Halley (Antarctica) for the year 2015 (89% data coverage; 6-209 nm size range; daily size resolution). By applying the Hartigan-Wong k-mean method we find eight clusters describing the entire aerosol population. Three clusters show pristine average low particle number concentrations (&lt;121-179 cm-3) with three main modes (30, 75-95 and 135-160 nm) and represent 57% of the annual PSD (up to 89 %-100% during winter and 34 %-65% during summer based on monthly averages). Nucleation and Aitken mode PSD clusters dominate summer months (September-January, 59 %-90 %), whereas a clear bimodal distribution (43 and 134 nm, respectively; Hoppel minimum at mode 75 nm) is seen only during the December-April period (6 %-21 %). Major findings of the current work include: (1) NPF and growth events originate from both the sea ice marginal zone and the Antarctic plateau, strongly suggesting multiple vertical origins, including the marine boundary layer and free troposphere; (2) very low particle number concentrations are detected for a substantial part of the year (57 %), including summer (34 %-65 %), suggesting that the strong annual aerosol concentration cycle is driven by a short temporal interval of strong NPF events; (3) a unique pristine aerosol cluster is seen with a bimodal size distribution (75 and 160 nm, respectively), strongly associated with high wind speed and possibly associated with blowing snow and sea spray sea salt, dominating the winter aerosol population (34 %-54 %). A brief comparison with two other stations (Dome C - Concordia - and King Sejong Station) during the year 2015 (240 d overlap) shows that the dynamics of aerosol number concentrations and distributions are more complex than the simple sulfate-sea-spray binary combination, and it is likely that an array of additional chemical components and processes drive the aerosol population.

Such approaches often make appeals to (lack of) capacity when seeking to understand the many limits to local sustainability programmes, however local government capacity is rarely given a primary analytical focus. We offer a definition of local government sustainable energy capacity, organise it into six types, and explore it in relation to contextual factors across scales: political institutions; energy and climate change policies and material aspects of energy systems. This heuristic framework is applied to case studies of eight local and combined authorities in England, a country with particularly centralised political institutions and energy systems. We conclude that capacity is a useful lens through which to explore the extent to which, and importantly how, local governments can become active sustainability actors. We also find that the development of knowledge capacity is becoming increasingly important; that there is some evidence of political re-scaling in energy; and identify some ways in which material aspects of energy systems have significant implications for local government sustainable energy capacity. © 2019 The Authors",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076859562

The objective of the present study is to optimize the die design to increase the pass numbers on the basis of die geometry, material properties and sheet thickness by avoiding the local failure. Two response variables namely, maximum equivalent strain and strain inhomogeneity factor, were used to define the objective function. The principal component analysis followed by the gray relational analysis was deployed to develop a single objective function in terms of gray relational grade. A hybrid approach of genetic algorithm followed by gradient-based optimization was adopted to identify the optimal parameters. AA5083 sheets could be successfully deformed with the improved die design while in case of low carbon steel, the number of passes increased from five to seven. The maximum equivalent strain imparted in each material also increased.

To help make land-use and climate change adaptation policies more effective at a local scale, this study used a combination of participatory approaches and computer simulationmodeling. Thismethodology (called the ""ParticipatoryWatershed Land-use Management"" (PWLM) approach) consist of four major steps: (a) Scenario analysis, (b) impact assessment, (c) developing adaptation and mitigation measures and its integration in local government policies, and (d) improvement of land use plan. As a test case, we conducted PWLM in the Santa Rosa Sub-watershed of the Philippines, a rapidly urbanizing area outside Metro Manila. The scenario analysis step involved a participatory land-use mapping activity (to understand future likely land-use changes), as well as GCM precipitation and temperature data downscaling (to understand the local climate scenarios). For impact assessment, the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool was used to simulate future river water quality (BOD and E. coli) under a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario and several alternative future scenarios considering different drivers and pressures (to 2030). Water samples from the Santa Rosa River in 2015 showed that BOD values ranged from 13 to 52 mg/L; indicating that the river is already moderately to extremely polluted compared to desirable water quality (class B). In the future scenarios, we found that water quality will deteriorate further by 2030 under all scenarios. Population growth was found to have the highest impact on future water quality deterioration, while climate change had the lowest (although not negligible). After the impact assessment, different mitigation measures were suggested in a stakeholder consultation workshop, and of them (enhanced capacity of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and increased sewerage connection rate) were adopted to generate a final scenario including countermeasures. The main benefit of the PWLM approach are its high level of stakeholder involvement (through co-generation of the research) and use of free (for developing countries) software and models, both of which contribute to an enhanced science-policy interface. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change adaptation; Domestic wastewater management; Sustainable development goals; Urbanization; Water quality; WEAP","Deterioration; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Escherichia coli; Land use; Marine pollution; Population statistics; Quality control; River pollution; Rivers; Wastewater treatment; Water management; Water quality; Watersheds; Climate change adaptation; Participatory approach; Science - policy interfaces; Stakeholder consultation; Stakeholder involvement; Wastewater treatment plants; Water quality deterioration; Waterresource management; Climate change; climate change; coastal water; downscaling; general circulation model; local government; participatory approach; population growth; software; urbanization; wastewater treatment plant; water management; watershed; Guatemala [Central America]; National Capital Region; Philippines; Santa Rosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084665675

The study proposes that analysis of data on the available amount of chemical and biological contamination in water is the first pressing requirement for this approach. In addition, climate change is causing an uneven pattern of rainfall and severe drought conditions and thus need a substantial attention to delineate the preventive ways for its mitigation in the water-scarce area as well as areas with high groundwater depletion or area contributing to the recharge. Most of the Indian rivers are polluted, and hence the removal of pollutants is an additional task for making a watershed resilient. There is a necessity to evaluate urban water for its better definition and develop the Water Quality Information Platform (WQIP) for layman understanding. The contemporary need for an approach for sustainable water supply must be developed with an understanding of the expected climate change scenario. The idea of “your experience, my learning opportunity” was found very relevant in implementing the developed world experience to a developing nation scenario.

These regulations are expected to be even more strict in future to control global warming, associated health issues and conserve energy. Automobile industries find it difficult to meet these regulations during the homologation cycle i.e. NEDC (New European Drive Cycle). Experiments and research indicated that engine structural parts achieve steady-state near end of the homologation cycle; which lead to account cold start effects as well during testing. Also, studies have proved that thermal efficiency of an IC engine is severely affected in cold start condition due to higher friction losses, incomplete combustion and their allied effects. Oil and coolant temperature helps in diminishing mechanical losses and achieving complete combustion. Hence, an effective distribution of combustion and friction heat during a cold start period is of utmost importance. The objective of the present study is to assess the intended cooling system configuration (s) for better warm-up through 1D virtual tool FloMASTER®. One dimensional (1D) virtual tools have both time and cost benefits over physical testing and 3D virtual tools with judicious outputs. This work has been conducted in two-phase: (i) Develop baseline engine thermal 1D model and validate with cold ambient test data and (ii) Simulate and analyze different engine cooling system configuration (s) to optimize warm-up.

However, implementation of global policies is associated closely with national, regional and local processes. For this reason, it is critically important to strengthen our understanding of the diversity of experiments because such urban climate change initiatives may affect the expectations and demands that will be placed on future projects. Moreover, to reveal the effect of the factors, such as participation in transnational networks, on the experiments at local level is also critically important in contextually different settings. From this point of view, the present study aims to present experimentation in addressing climate change in the case of the Nilüfer Municipality in northwestern Turkey and to examine the effect of joining an international network, as a key factor that may support urban climate experiments. The research is designed as a case study built on both primary and secondary sources. The Nilüfer Municipality is selected as the case area as it is the only signatory of Mayors Adapt and one of sixteen signatories of the Covenant of Mayors (CoM) among the 1397 municipalities within the Turkish Republic. Finally, this case study shows that although local governments have not been involved in the climate change policies at the national level in the Turkish context, the Nilüfer Municipality was able to develop its own experiments by being part of a transnational network, especially after signing the Covenant of Mayors in 2014. This finding leads us to the conclusion that supranational organizations can have significant impact on the climate experiments initiation of local governments that are important actors in the implementation of policies to address climate change as a global problem. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Experiments; Local government; Nilüfer Municipality; Transnational climate network","climate change; local government; policy implementation; urban climate; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062031948

In the western portion of its range, where most precipitation arrives during winter as snowfall and summers are dry, snowdrifts that persist into the growing season provide soil moisture recharge that sustain aspen groves. Aspen groves are important locations of biodiversity within these landscapes. There is growing concern that reduced snowpack due to climate change may reduce the long-term persistence and productivity of aspen communities in these regions. In this study, we evaluated the potential for climate change and drought to reduce or eliminate isolated aspen communities in southwestern Idaho. We used a landscape simulation model integrated with inputs from an empirically derived biogeochemical model of growth, and a species distribution model of regeneration to forecast how changes in climate, declining snowpack, and competition with a conifer species is likely to affect aspen occupancy over the next 85-years. We found that simulated reductions in snowpack depth (and associated increases in climatic water deficit) caused a reduction in aspen persistence; aspen occupancy was reduced under all high emissions climate scenarios. Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) occupancy also declined under all future climates. Aspen regeneration declined over the course of all simulations, with an ensemble ratio of mortality/establishment increasing over the course of both low and high emissions climate scenarios. Climate-induced mortality of aspen clones increased in frequency under all climate scenarios and, under the most severe emissions scenarios, contributed to a substantial decline of aspen cover. Our research suggests that snowbanks will become an important determinant of long-term persistence of aspen under changing climate in the region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Drought; Quaking aspen; Regeneration; Snowdrift zones","Biodiversity; Climate models; Drought; Reforestation; Soil moisture; Biogeochemical modeling; Landscape simulation; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Quaking aspens; Regeneration; Simulated reduction; Species distribution modeling; Western United States; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; coniferous tree; drought; growing season; landscape ecology; mortality; persistence; snowpack; soil moisture; Biodiversity; Clones; Drought; Ecosystems; Mortality; Populus; Pseudotsuga Menziesii; Reforestation; Idaho; United States; Coniferophyta; Populus tremuloides; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079898080

However, specific molecular mechanism(s) of this link remained unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that various CCM metabolites can suppress the effects of mutations in different replication genes of E. coli on bacterial growth, cell morphology, and nucleoid localization. This provides evidence that the CCM-replication link is mediated by metabolites rather than direct protein-protein interactions. On the other hand, action of metabolites on DNA replication appears indirect rather than based on direct influence on the replication machinery, as rate of DNA synthesis could not be corrected by metabolites in short-term experiments. This corroborates the recent discovery that in B. subtilis, there are multiple links connecting CCM to DNA replication initiation and elongation. Therefore, one may suggest that although different in detail, the molecular mechanisms of CCM-dependent regulation of DNA replication are similar in E. coli and B. subtilis, making this regulation an important and common constituent of the control of cell physiology in bacteria. © 2020 by the authors.

The Autism Program Environment Rating Scale–Middle/High School was used to rate the quality of programs for students with autism spectrum disorder in 60 high schools located in three geographic locations in the United States (CA, NC, and WI). Findings indicated that the total quality rating across schools was slightly above the adequate criterion. Higher quality ratings occurred for program environment, learning climate, family participation, and teaming domains. However, quality ratings for intervention domains related to the characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (e.g. communication, social, independence, functional behavior, and transition) were below the adequate quality rating level. Also, quality ratings for transition were significantly higher for modified (primarily self-contained) programs than standard diploma (primarily served in general education) programs. School urbanicity was a significant predictor of program quality, with suburban schools having higher quality ratings than urban or rural schools, controlling for race, school enrollment size, and Title 1 eligibility status. Implications for working with teachers and school teams that support high school students with autism spectrum disorder should include a targeted focus on transition programming that includes a breadth of work-based learning experiences and activities that support social-communication domains. © The Author(s) 2019.","autism spectrum disorders; high school; interventions—psychosocial/behavioral","academic achievement; adolescent; Article; autism; behavior assessment; education; education program; functional behavior; health survey; high school; human; independence; interpersonal communication; knowledge; learning; learning environment; major clinical study; priority journal; program impact; psychometry; rating scale; school program; self concept; social adaptation; social interaction; suburban population; United States; urban health; autism; child; female; male; organization and management; psychology; quality of life; school; student; young adult; Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Communication; Female; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Schools; Social Interaction; Students; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075487293

There is a strong assumption among community-based monitoring advocates that community monitoring is a desirable approach. However, it is unclear why community members would want to participate in their own surveillance or be involved in a program likely to limit livelihood uses of forest areas and possibly even sanction them based on the data provided. This paper explores these issues by examining three communities involved in Peru's Conditional Direct Transfer Program, in which indigenous communities are compensated for protecting communal forests through various mechanisms, including forest monitoring. The case studies focus specifically on communities that received smartphones and were trained in their use for monitoring. The results affirm the importance that benefits outweigh the costs of local participation to sustain motivation. They also point to key factors supporting the legitimacy of the program, specifically to overcome historical tensions between the state and indigenous communities. These include the nature of engagement by program implementers and the importance of building trust over time. © 2020 by the authors.","Community-based monitoring; Conditional direct transfer program; Legitimacy; MRV; Payments for environmental services; REDD+; Sustainability","Deforestation; Developing countries; Climate mitigations; Community engagement; Community-based monitoring; Forest degradation; Forest monitoring; Indigenous community; Reducing emissions; Sustainable management; Sustainable development; conservation management; developing world; forest management; forestry policy; forestry production; policy implementation; Red List; sustainability; Computer Programs; Data; Deforestation; Degradation; Developing Countries; Forests; Monitoring; Payment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084541964

The coatings were studied in the laboratory after exposure to marine environment in Mikrolimano harbor in a distance of 12 km southwest from the city of Piraeus in the east coast of the Saronic Gulf (WILKENS) and Singapore harbor (Re-Turn). Laboratory measurements showed that CeMo (8-HQ) coatings exhibit better anticorrosion stability of paints in sea water than commercial paints.

The environmental factors behind bacterial community composition and Vibrio distribution were investigated in an estuarine system of a cholera-endemic region in the coastline of Bangladesh. Higher temperatures and sewage pollution were important drivers of the abundance of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae. A closer relation between non-culturable Vibrio and particulate organic matter (POM) was inferred during the post-monsoon. The distribution of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Vibrio genus was likely driven by salinity and temperature. The resuspension of sediments increased Vibrio abundance and organic nutrient concentrations. The δ13C dynamic in POM followed an increasing gradient from freshwater to marine stations; nevertheless, it was not a marker of sewage pollution. Bacteroidales and culturable coliforms were reliable indicators of untreated wastewater during pre and post-monsoon seasons. The presumptive incorporation of depleted-ammonium derived from ammonification processes under the hypoxic conditions, by some microorganisms such as Cloacibacterium and particularly by Arcobacter nearby the sewage discharge, contributed to the drastic 15N depletion in the POM. The likely capacity of extracellular polymeric substances production of these taxa may facilitate the colonization of POM from anthropogenic origin and may signify important properties for wastewater bioremediation. Genera of potential pathogens other than Vibrio associated with sewage pollution were Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Arcobacter, and Bergeyella. The changing environmental conditions of the estuary favored the abundance of early colonizers and the island biogeography theory explained the distribution of some bacterial groups. This multidisciplinary study evidenced clearly the eutrophic conditions of the Karnaphuli estuary and assessed comprehensively its current bacterial baseline and potential risks. The prevailing conditions together with human overpopulation and frequent natural disasters, transform the region in one of the most vulnerable to climate change.

Residents in the ger areas of Ulaanbaatar are unable to take advantage of the laws and policy regulations to reduce air pollution despite years of efforts to address this issue by international and local organizations including the government of Mongolia (GoM). Important challenges and barriers that have limited the success of various governmental policies that tackle air pollution problems were identified through participatory approaches. In order to do this, personal interviews were conducted with various stakeholders such as officials from central and local governments, government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations, and academia. Moreover, a workshop was conducted to elucidate the views of ger area community members in Ulaanbaatar. Based on the results of these interviews and workshop, the gaps between the policy approaches of the government, the actual conditions, and the desired situations of the residents to improve air quality in Ulaanbaatar were analyzed. The large gaps that were identified between the national and local perspectives on air pollution issues demonstrated that the reduction of air pollution in Ulaanbaatar requires solving fundamental and complex problems based on a better understanding of the specific conditions and needs of the residents of the ger areas. Moreover, active participation and discussion of the residents at the workshop indicated that community-based approaches could be applied in the cultural context of Mongolia with promising results in finding solutions. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Participatory approach; Participatory workshop; Sustainable local decision-making","air quality; atmospheric pollution; government; local government; participatory approach; pollution policy; stakeholder; standard (regulation); Central Province [Mongolia]; Mongolia; Ulaanbaatar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084631866

Although such audits impose non-trivial costs on building owners, their energy use impacts have not been empirically evaluated. Here we examine the effect of a large-scale mandatory audit policy—New York City’s Local Law 87—on building energy use, using detailed audit and energy data between 2011 and 2016 for approximately 4,000 buildings. This specific policy context, in which the compliance year is randomly assigned, provides a unique opportunity to explore the audit effect without the self-selection bias found in studies of voluntary audit policies. We find energy use reductions of approximately –2.5% for multifamily residential buildings and –4.9% for office buildings. The results suggest that mandatory audits, by themselves, create an insufficient incentive to invest in energy efficiency at the scale needed to meet citywide carbon-reduction goals. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Energy efficiency; Office buildings; Building energy use; Building owners; Carbon reduction; Information asymmetry; Knowledge gaps; New York city; Residential building; Self-selection bias; Energy utilization; asymmetry; building; carbon; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; incentive; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082960735

However, many circumstances such as terrain shape, forestation or urban planning can prevent the deliver and operation of various types of machinery. Consequently, an important area of development for the basics of machine construction is non-road machinery. The high mobility and relatively low own weight allow operation in the most adverse conditions. One of such machines are chippers for wood branches. They are usually driven by combustion engines, which means they emit pollutants in the fuel combustion process together with noise and vibrations. All the above factors can negatively affect both the machine operator and the environment. It is therefore justified to examine the possibility to reduce the emission level of harmful media. This paper presents the results of study involving the measurement of vibration and noise generated during operation of a chipper with combustion engine under various operating conditions. The presented results will allow to identify the scale and place of origin of vibrations. They can act as a source of practical guidelines for the design of machines of this type. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

This paper presents the development of a modular building structural system that provides for the harmonization between the structural and functional lifespans of a building in order to achieve greater sustainability. The limitations of the existing prefabricated urban buildings with respect to their adaptability are contrasted with the proposed solution. The use of prefabricated engineered materials, such as cross laminated timber (CLT) and CLT-concrete composites, in conjunction with a modular system, reduces any climatic effects. The inherent advantages of incorporating detachable connections allows for the necessary structural adaptability, subsequently harmonizing and elongating the structural and functional lifespans. The resulting sustainable concept, when applied to residential buildings, could serve as a solution to address projections of future urban growth. © 2020 WITPress.

Exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with increases in morbidity and mortality and has been recognized as a leading contributor to global disease burden. Objective: To examine the association between short-term exposure to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or smaller (PM2.5) and the incidence of OHCAs of cardiac origin and with the development of initial cardiac arrest rhythm. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study used data from cases registered between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2016, in the All-Japan Utstein Registry, a prospective, nationwide, population-based database for OHCAs across all 47 Japanese prefectures. These OHCA cases included patients who had bystander-witnessed OHCAs and for whom emergency medical services responders initiated resuscitation before hospital transfer. A case-crossover design was employed for the study analyses. A prefecture-specific, conditional logistic regression model to estimate odds ratios was applied, and a random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain prefecture-specific pooled estimates. All analyses were performed from May 7, 2019, to January 23, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was the association of short-term PM2.5 exposure with the incidence of bystander-witnessed OHCAs of cardiac origin. The differences in the distribution of initial cardiac arrest rhythm in OHCAs among those with exposure to PM2.5 were also examined. Results: In total, 103 189 OHCAs witnessed by bystanders were included in the final analysis. Among the patients who experienced such OHCAs, the mean (SD) age was 75 (15.5) years, and 62 795 (60.9%) were men. Point estimates of the percentage increase for a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 at lag0-1 (difference in mean PM2.5 concentrations measured on the case day and 1 day before) demonstrated a statistically significantly higher incidence of OHCA across most of the 47 prefectures, without significant heterogeneity (I2 = 20.1%; P = .12). A stratified analysis found an association between PM2.5 exposure and OHCAs (% increase, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.1%-3.1%). An initial shockable rhythm, such as ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (% increase, 0.6; 95% CI, -2.0% to 3.2%), was not associated with PM2.5 exposure. However, an initial nonshockable rhythm, such as pulseless electrical activity and asystole, was associated with PM2.5 exposure (% increase, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.1%-2.7%). Conclusions and Relevance: Findings from this study suggest that increased PM2.5 concentration is associated with bystander-witnessed OHCA of cardiac origin that commonly presents with nonshockable rhythm. The results support measures to reduce PM2.5 exposure to prevent OHCAs of cardiac origin.",,"aged; case control study; exposure; female; human; Japan; male; middle aged; out of hospital cardiac arrest; particulate matter; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083909346

Because of the variable nature of renewable energy, however, the integration of renewables becomes increasingly costly and difficult as the renewable penetration becomes higher. The recent rise of electric vehicles (EVs) provides us with an opportunity to increase self-consumption of solar photovoltaic (PV) at households with substantially lower additional costs. In this paper, an environmental techno-economic assessment of residential PV systems is conducted with battery or EVs allowing charging and discharging (Vehicle to Home: V2H) in Kyoto, Japan, and Shenzhen, China, incorporating the cost projections of these technologies towards 2030. It is found that “PV + EV” (V2H) becomes highly cost-effective towards 2030 in Kyoto in comparison with “PV only”, “PV + battery”, and “EV charge”. In the region of lower electricity costs such as Shenzhen, switching to EVs from gasoline vehicles is the most cost-effective option during 2020s. Finally, it is found that “PV + EV” has the highest CO2 emission reduction potential across all the technology combinations considered, owing to EV charging of carbon-free electricity from PV. To facilitate a rapid household decarbonization, policy makers should reinforce policies to enhance the penetration of combined technologies of “PV + EV” (V2H) towards 2030. © 2019","Decarbonization; Electric vehicle; Household; Photovoltaics; Vehicle to home","Charging (batteries); Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decarbonization; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Environmental technology; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Carbon-free electricity; CO2 emission reduction; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Household; Integration of renewables; Photovoltaics; Residential PV systems; Techno-economic assessment; Secondary batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077439841

The rust layer grown in a coastal region of Japan was used as a model rust layer. The x-ray diffraction analysis of the model rust layer revealed that the layer consisted of α-FeOOH, β-FeOOH, γ-FeOOH, and Fe3O4. During the cyclic corrosion test, an additional immersion of the surface in solutions containing metal cations such as Mg2+, Al3+, Cu2+, or Ni2+ was performed. The additional immersion in the cation-containing solutions modified the model rust layer, that is, the fraction of stable α-FeOOH increased in the rust layer.

Here, we investigated sulfate (SO42−) in pore water and compositional and isotopic gas signatures at ARAON Mounds (hydrate/nonhydrate-bearing sites) and background site in the Chukchi Sea. Sulfate-methane transition (SMT) did not reach at the background site but occurred at shallow depths (≤3.3 m below the seafloor) at all ARAON Mounds sites. The SO42− profiles at ARAON Mounds also clearly indicate the unsteady state due to upward gas migration by high flux at the hydrate-bearing sites compared to the nonhydrate-bearing sites. The isotopic signatures of gas samples at the hydrate-bearing sites and below the SMT at the nonhydrate-bearing sites reflect thermogenic source transported across at least 1 km through faults/fractures in the Chukchi Sea. The headspace (HS) gas samples above/near the SMT at the nonhydrate-bearing sites are affected by the biogenic CH4 with enriched 12C; they indicate biogenic or thermogenic/biogenic mixed sources. The thermogenic gases below the SMT at ARAON Mounds have high C1/C2+ ratios (&gt;300), much higher than those of normal thermogenic gases in offshore shallow sediments (&lt;100), due to postgenetic processes during migration. The carbon isotopic fractionation (εc = δ13CCO2 - δ13CCH4) in HS samples of the background site and ARAON Mounds above the SMT are consistent with the biogenic gas range generated via microbial CO2 reduction. However, εc below the SMT is anomalously low (13–42‰) and is higher at the hydrate-bearing sites than at the nonhydrate-bearing sites. We postulate that this low εc is explained by the two-phase fluid transport model of Kim et al. (2012) and that gas hydrates highly influence this value. We suggest that εc can be used as a powerful geochemical proxy for the upward gas migration and gas hydrate occurrence in shallow marine sediment systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","ARAON Mounds; Arctic Ocean; Carbon isotopic fractionation; Thermogenic gas; Upward gas migration","Carbon; Gases; Hydration; Isotopes; Methane; Offshore oil well production; Sediments; Submarine geology; Sulfur compounds; ARAON Mounds; Arctic ocean; Gas migration; Isotopic fractionations; Thermogenic gas; Gas hydrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080893426

To account for the nonstationary time series in the panel, we employ a fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and estimate long-run elasticity. From the empirical results, we can find the nonlinear relationship between income and CO2 emissions. Additionally, we verify the fact that population aging reduces CO2 emissions. A 1% increase in the proportion of the elderly results in a 0.4% decrease in CO2 emissions. On the other hand, the younger population increases CO2 emissions.

National and state regulators routinely tighten the energy efficiency building code appliance standards. In particular, for low-income households, the government has been implementing an energy efficiency program, and the most common measures include furnace replacement, attic and wall insulation, and infiltration reduction. The belief that the energy efficiency programs are beneficial and lead to energy reductions often fails, which is known as the 'efficiency gap.' This paper analyzed the effect of input data in calculating the energy savings of the energy efficiency program for low-income households as a cause of the energy efficiency gap in energy efficiency treatments for low-income households. According to the retrofit of the low-income household, the energy saving effect predicted through the input data of detailed measurement was 65%, which was higher than 41% of the conventional prediction method (walk-through audit). The resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction effect was also the same as the energy savings, and the results predicted by the existing prediction methods were less predicted than the detailed measurement results. © 2020 by the authors.","Energy efficiency gap; Energy efficiency program; Energy saving; Low-income households; Prediction method; Thermal comfort","data set; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy policy; government",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083650453

Planktonic foraminifera and the existing stratigraphical framework of the Talara Basin indicate an early Oligocene, or possibly late Eocene, age of these deposits. They are found in three distinct areas – Belén, Cerro La Salina and Cerros El Pelado – and differ in their petrography, stable isotope signatures, and lipid biomarker and macrofaunal contents. At Belén, the carbon stable isotope signature of the carbonate and the abundance of n-alkanes indicates the possibility of oil seepage in addition to methane seepage; for Belén and Cerro La Salina the high abundance of the biomarker crocetane indicates a dominance of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea of the ANME-2 group, whereas the rather small combined crocetane/phytane peak of a Cerros El Pelado limestone agrees with mixed ANME-1/ANME-2 input. The macrofauna consists mainly of molluscs; the Cerro La Salina sites include mostly infaunal thyasirid and lucinid bivalves and only few vesicomyid bivalves; gastropods include Provanna antiqua, the limpet Pyropelta and several vetigastropods. The Belén site is dominated by the elongate vesicomyid bivalve Pleurophopsis lithophagoides. The most common bivalve at the Cerros El Pelado sites is an undetermined, possible vesicomyid, and a smooth provannid gastropod. Biogeographically the faunas are most similar to those of the northwestern United States, as indicated by two joint species; similarities on the genus level (Conchocele, Lucinoma, Pleurophopsis, Provanna, Colus) exist also with Japan and the Caribbean region. © 2019 Lethaia Foundation.

There are various system layouts for 48V hybrid system including P0, P1, P2. In this paper, P2 architecture is used to investigate the effects of water injection benefits in a mild hybrid system. Electrification of the conventional powertrain uses the benefits of an electric drive in the low load-low speed region where the conventional SI engine is least efficient and as the load demand increases the IC Engine is used in its more efficient operating region. Engine downsizing and forced induction trend is popular in the hybrid system architecture. However, the engine efficiency is limited by combustion knocking at higher loads thus ignition retard is used to avoid knocking and fuel enrichment becomes must to operate the engine at MBT (Maximum Brake Torque) timing; in turn neutralizing the benefits of fuel savings by electrification. Water injection suppresses engine knocking and enables operating at stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. In addition to that, the injection of water reduces flame temperature, giving room to ignition advance towards MBT timing. Ignition timing close to MBT results in higher thermal efficiency. Operating a downsized engine installed with water injection in a hybrid powertrain architecture can be beneficial in exploiting both technologies and cumulatively a high efficiency powertrain can be produced. A 48V compact passenger car simulation model, developed in GT-suite, was used to simulate the fuel efficiency using experimental results. A 1.5 L, downsized-turbocharged SI-engine was operated with and without water addition during the experiments. Fuel consumption benefits of approximately 0.5 to 1% were observed in stationary to aggressive drive cycles. © 2020 SAE International.

Vulnerabilities of 27 common species were examined based on 2071–2100 regional climate projections. Interviews were then conducted with practitioners working in the public and private sectors. The results suggest that the majority of examined species will be vulnerable to multiple conditions associated with projected climate. Practitioners all perceive recent changes in climate and extreme weather patterns, but do not prioritize future climate conditions in their species selection decisions. Moreover, they expressed uncertainty about how to make species selection decisions in light of climate change. Given the predicted vulnerabilities, alternative species need to be considered or more management resources (e.g., for watering) will be required to maintain the current composition.

Pakistan is among the top ten most prone nations to CC in the world. The objective of this analysis was to quantify the economic impacts of CC on the agricultural production system and to quantify the impacts of suggested adaptation strategies at the farm level. The study was conducted in the Punjab province’s rice-wheat cropping system. For this purpose, climate modeling was carried out by using two representative concentration pathways (RCPs), i.e., RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, and five global circulation models (GCMs). The crop modeling was carried out by using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop simulation models (CSMs), which were tested on the cross-sectional data of 217 farm households collected from the seven strata in the study area. The socio-economic impacts were calculated using the Multidimensional Impact Assessment Tradeoff Analysis Model (TOA-MD). The results revealed that CC’s net economic impact using both RCPs and CSMs was negative. In both CSMs, the poverty status was higher in RCP 8.5 than in RCP 4.5. The adaptation package showed positive results in poverty reduction and improvement in the livelihood conditions of the agricultural households. The adoption rate for DSSAT was about 78%, and for APSIM, it was about 68%. The adaptation benefits observed in DSSAT were higher than in APSIM. The results showed that the suggested adaptations could have a significant impact on the resilience of the atmospheric changes. Therefore, without these adaptation measures, i.e., increase in sowing density, improved cultivars, increase in nitrogen use, and fertigation, there would be negative impacts of CC that would capitalize on livelihood and food security in the study area. © 2020, MDPI AG.

We find that fieldworkers use people's own experiences to make intangible carbon visible, but rely on scientific concepts to explain the transfer of carbon between states. However, interviews suggest that project communities’ knowledge and understanding of carbon is partial. This highlights the challenges of meeting the safeguarding principles of respect for local knowledge and informed consent in carbon projects.

Policy and research to date have focused on technical potential and there are gaps in understanding social contexts, which are key to energy efficiency improvement. Furthermore, SMEs have been overlooked, despite the need for concerted action here to meet targets. In this study, mixed-method case study research is undertaken with three independent retailers (a butcher, fishmonger and cycle-shop) to explore energy management and energy efficiency adoption. Building on the 4Cs “Concern, Conditions and Capacity within a Community” (4Cs) framework developed by Janda, this study has identified the interrelationships between Cs and explored the underlying factors that appear the be more important in determining responses to energy efficiency opportunities. Reflecting on the 4Cs, improving energy efficiency within this sector is complex, so it is perhaps not surprising that energy efficiency adoption has been low to date. This study highlights the importance of the ‘social’ within a socio-technical context. Whilst technical conditions are invariably the most important factor in engineering calculations of energy efficiency potential, they appear to be of considerably less importance than social contexts in practice. The findings suggest that a greater focus on social context within a socio-technical frame could help make future policy interventions more effective. Whilst some of these findings may be sector-specific, several are likely to be transferable to other SMEs, retail and hospitality organisations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Energy; Energy efficiency; Mixed-methods; Non-domestic; Retail; Small businesses; Socio-technical",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075530760

Industrial ecology has robustly addressed these sectors’ contributions to climate change, but not their vulnerability to climate change. Climate change vulnerability must be addressed through development of climate change adaptation and resiliency strategies. However, there is a fundamental tension between the primary objectives of industrial ecology (efficiency, cyclic flows, and pollution prevention) and what is needed for climate change adaptation and resiliency. We develop here two potential ways through which the field can overcome (or work within) this tension and combine the tools and methods of industrial ecology with the science and process of climate change adaptation. The first layers industrial ecology tools on top of climate change adaptation strategies, allowing one to, for example, compare the environmental impacts of different adaptation strategies. The other embeds climate change adaptation and resiliency within industrial ecology tools, for example, by redefining the functional unit in life cycle assessment (LCA) to include functions of resiliency. In both, industrial ecology plays a somewhat narrow role, informing climate change adaptation and resilience decision-making by providing quantitative indicators of environmental performance. This role for industrial ecology is important given the significant contributions and potential for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from food and agriculture. However, it suggests that industrial ecology's role in climate adaptation will be as an evaluator of adaptation strategies, rather than an originator. © 2019 by Yale University","cyclic flows; efficiency; industrial ecology; life cycle assessment (LCA); mitigation; resilience","Agriculture; Decision making; Efficiency; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Cyclic flow; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); mitigation; resilience; Climate change; agrometeorology; climate change; decision making; environmental impact; food industry; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; life cycle analysis; local adaptation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063671636

Several REDD+ projects aimed at reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, conserving and enhancing forest carbon stocks, and sustainably managing forests have been implemented in Cambodia but few studies have examined the effects on local livelihoods before and during project implementation. Our study applies a sustainable livelihood framework to assess the livelihood assets of local communities in the Oddar Meanchey and Keo Seima REDD+ project sites in Cambodia before and during project implementation. Five capital assets, namely natural, physical, human, financial, and social capital, are assessed and scored on a 1-to-5 Likert scale. Data analysis collected through 252 interviews in Oddar Meanchey and Keo Seima reveals a slight increase in livelihood assets in both sites from project validation to implementation. Generally, the mean scores for local livelihood assets increased from 2.81 ± 0.07 (±is followed by the standard error) and 2.66 ± 0.06 to 3.07 ± 0.09 and 3.06 ± 0.08 in Oddar Meanchey and Keo Seima, respectively. Nevertheless, natural capital assets sharply declined from 3.50 and 3.32 to 2.09 and 2.25, respectively. Respondents mainly blamed illegal logging for the decline, suggesting that strict patrolling and enforcement must be implemented. Furthermore, the scarcity of carbon-credit buyers and the projects’ inability to generate carbon-based revenues has led to dissatisfaction among local communities, inducing avoidable illegal activities in pursuit of short-term benefits. A financial mechanism to ensure sufficient and sustained financial support regardless of carbon-market volatility is urgently needed. © 2020Business; Economics; Livelihood Improvement; REDD+; Natural Capital; Physical Capital; human capital; Financial Capital; Carbon Credit; Agricultural Policy; Agroforestry; Ecological Restoration; Forestry; Human Geography; Natural Resource Management; Sustainable Development; Ecosystem Services; Biodiversity © 2020","Agricultural policy; Agroforestry; Biodiversity; Business; Carbon credit; Ecological restoration; Economics; Ecosystem services; Financial capital; Forestry; Human capital; Human geography; Livelihood improvement; Natural capital; Natural resource management; Physical capital; REDD+; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083510134

This concept has shown remarkable promise in power generation, desalination, distillation, water splitting, sterilization, oil spill cleanup, electricity generation from salinity and also CO2 capture. In this concept, a material paradigm localizes the solar irradiation forming a hot spot in the material and minimizes the energy losses to the surrounding environment. In most applications, the localized thermal energy is used for liquid-vapor phase change in which the material wicks the liquid into the hot spot to generate hot steam. In contrast to conventional steam generation systems, thermal losses are reduced significantly, thereby offering high evaporation efficiencies. In this comprehensive review, the physics of solar heat localization is elaborated and a roadmap on necessary material properties is provided to achieve superior performance through this concept. The current advancements in the synthesis of new materials for solar heat localization are discussed in detail. Various applications of this concept are explored individually and the figures of merit for each application are elucidated. A comparative analysis is conducted for these figures of merit on a wide range of studies and key takeaways are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects for technological implementation of this concept are reviewed. As solar energy is the most abundant renewable energy resource on earth, this concept could provide a path to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of electricity and water generation in the world. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon footprint; Desalination; Distillation; Energy dissipation; Oil spills; Petroleum prospecting; Solar energy; Solar heating; Thermal energy; Comparative analysis; Electricity generation; Emerging applications; Liquid-vapor phase change; Solar thermal energy; Steam generation system; Surrounding environment; Synthesis of new materials; Electric power generation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083356877

A good understanding of energy systems from existing research will provide multidimensional insights for appropriate actions against global warming. This study conducts a systematic review of the literature covering 1,184 articles on energy issues dealing with climate change mitigation. Using a novel hand-coding typology analysis, we characterize the body of knowledge and identify possible research gaps according to the heterogeneity of the energy process, time scale, geographic location, energy technology, and concerned end-use sector. We find that research interest mainly focuses on the energy supply (496 papers) and the end-use process (359 papers). Energy storage and the energy–water–land nexus are two emerging areas. Biomass, solar, wind, and nuclear energy are the technologies that attract the most attention, while interest in hydrogen energy production and waste-to-energy has grown very recently. The cost-benefit and mitigation potential of renewable generation are the most studied topics, followed by the impacts of climate change on electricity production. In contrast, little attention is paid to research on traditional oil and gas exploration. Regarding the end-use sector, residents and transport are the most evident sectors studied. China, the United States, and Europe are the most featured regions while very few studies focus on Africa, South America, and Small Island Developing States. Current research topics concentrate on how to maximize the co-benefit of greenhouse gas mitigation and eco-environment protection via cost-benefit reinventions of energy systems.

With abundant glucose, many cells prefer to grow by aerobic glycolysis or fermentation. Using 161 natural isolates of fission yeast, we investigated the genetic basis and phenotypic effects of the fermentation–respiration balance. The laboratory and a few other strains depended more on respiration. This trait was associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism in a conserved region of Pyk1, the sole pyruvate kinase in fission yeast. This variant reduced Pyk1 activity and glycolytic flux. Replacing the “low-activity” pyk1 allele in the laboratory strain with the “high-activity” allele was sufficient to increase fermentation and decrease respiration. This metabolic rebalancing triggered systems-level adjustments in the transcriptome and proteome and in cellular traits, including increased growth and chronological lifespan but decreased resistance to oxidative stress. Thus, low Pyk1 activity does not lead to a growth advantage but to stress tolerance. The genetic tuning of glycolytic flux may reflect an adaptive trade-off in a species lacking pyruvate kinase isoforms. © 2020 The Authors.

The complexity of beef systems means that appropriate GHG mitigating strategies depend on local conditions, requiring tailored entry points to be identified and evaluated. Using Scotland as a case study, here we combine a bio-economic simulation model and farm-level carbon footprinting tool to study the environmental impact of a range of beef production scenarios, and trade-offs generated between mitigating emissions and increasing farm profitability. To measure the environmental impact of finishing duration, type and gender selection of beef fattening systems, emissions were grouped into five categories: (1) land and crops, (2) enteric emissions, (3) manure, (4) feed and bedding, and (5) fuel and electricity.

Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements were performed before and after post deposition annealing (PDA) at 700 C. A large increase in leakage current and high interface state density were observed after the PDA in the MIS structure with AlO x . The interface state density was reduced to one-third in the MIS structure with AlON, probably due to the reduced carbon impurity density at the AlO x /GaN HEMT interfaces. Meanwhile, the MIS structure with SiN x maintained high breakdown voltages of over 200 V, even after the PDA. By employing SiN x /AlON layers, we demonstrated low interface state density of 2.3 1013 cm-2 eV-1 at E c - 0.31 eV and suppressed leakage current at -200 V.

While UV detectors and power electronic devices might seem far apart, we see similarities between the defect origins of dark current in the former and leakage currents in the latter. Both have their origins in crystal growth. The first part of the work focuses on the correlation between performance parameters of vertical deep-ultraviolet photodetectors on c-plane sapphire and the density of extended defects vis-à-vis screw and edge dislocations. Through a careful optimization of nucleation density on the growth surface, state-of-the-art crystalline quality AlN epi-layers were grown. This led to the realization of record performance 289 nm p-i-n photodiodes with zero-bias quantum efficiency of 92 %, leakage current below 1 nA at 100 V and breakdown field in excess of 6 MV/cm. Performance of III-nitride power devices on silicon, on the other hand, was found to be more sensitive to structural defects such as surface pits as compared to dislocations. By utilizing a two-temperature growth technique which involved an AlN layer grown at high temperatures, a significant reduction in the pit density could be achieved. This resulted in three-orders of magnitude reduction in lateral as well as vertical leakage in AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) on silicon. To achieve a further reduction in the reverse leakage current and an enhancement in the device breakdown voltage, point defect control also becomes important. Carbon doping to reduce the background n-carrier concentration in the GaN epilayers is discussed as one of the possible approaches. Reduction of pit density and C-incorporation cumulatively led to the realization of 2 MV/cm vertical breakdown field in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs on silicon. © 2020 IEEE.","Aluminum Gallium Nitride; Defects; High Electron Mobility Transistors; III-nitrides; Leakage; Ultraviolet Photodetectors","Aluminum gallium nitride; Aluminum nitride; Carrier concentration; Crystallization; Edge dislocations; Gallium nitride; High electron mobility transistors; III-V semiconductors; Leakage currents; Manufacture; Nitrides; Sapphire; Silicon; Algan/gan high electron-mobility transistors; Crystalline quality; Micro-structure Devices; Nucleation densities; Performance parameters; Power electronic devices; Reverse leakage current; Three orders of magnitude; Power HEMT",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091983672

This phenomenon can be explained as the effect of partial obscuration: the broad emission lines (BELs) in the ultraviolet waveband are heavily suppressed by the dust extinction, and thus the IELs become prominent; while the dust extinction is not significant in optical and infrared bands, and the IELs can hardly be detected due to the brightness of BELs. Using the IEL width and central supermassive black hole mass MBH∼5.75×108 M⊙ of J1516+1900, and assuming that the intermediate-width emission line region (IELR) is virialized, we estimate the distance of the IEL region to the central black hole is about 1.6 pc. On the other side, by combining the photoionization model calculations and observed IELs, we find that the IELR has a density of ∼1012 cm−3, and the ionization parameter of ∼10−0.65, and that its distance to the central region is ∼0.016 pc, which is only one percent of the virialized distance. This contradiction can provide an important clue for studying the geometry, physical condition, and origin of the IELRs in active galactic nuclei. © 2020","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: nuclei; quasars: emission lines; quasars: individual: SDSS J151653.22+190048.2; quasars: supermassive black holes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086664054

Urban land use and its resulting microclimates work in conjunction with the impacts of climate change. Among the principal environmental signals that modulate bud flush, only temperature has changed significantly in recent years. Throughout South Korea, abnormal shoots (usually known as lammas shoots) in Korean red pine (Pinus densiflora), which were once a rare phenomenon, have become notably more common in recent years. The phenomenon is prominent in urban site of each local area. These abnormal shoots appear at a higher frequency and grow to longer lengths in Seoul’s hotter urban center than in suburban sites and showed a close positive correlation with urban density and a close negative correlation with vegetation cover expressed as NDVI. Differences in temperature among the urban center, urban edge, and suburban greenbelt were significantly correlated with land-use intensity. Korean red pines planted in urban parks at sites in urban centers showed a lower frequency of abnormal shoots, and the length of the shoots was shorter, compared with those at the other urban sites. Furthermore, the phenology of Korean red pines in an urban park with a fountain showed a spatial difference, depending upon the distance from the fountain: pine trees close to the fountain did not produce abnormal shoots, but abnormal shoot growth increased with the distance from the fountain. These results are noteworthy because they are related to the cooling effects of evapotranspiration from vegetated landscapes and evaporation from a water body. From the results of this study, we could confirm that microclimate change due to urbanization accelerates the impacts of climate change on plant phenology. Furthermore, we identified the possibility that judicious land-use planning could contribute to minimizing the adverse effects of climate change. © 2020, ISB.","Abnormal growth; Climate change; Korean red pine; Land use pattern; Urbanization","microclimate; pine; South Korea; urbanization; Microclimate; Pinus; Republic of Korea; Seoul; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077600208

To this end, one-stage and two-stage (non-catalytic/catalytic) pyrolysis of MNS was performed to establish the fundamental relationship of temperature effect on syngas formation. The formation of gaseous pyrolysates was substantially enhanced when two-stage pyrolysis of MNS was applied, and second heating zone isothermally ran at 700 °C. Such the enhanced generation of gaseous pyrolysates from two-stage MNS pyrolysis of MNS was likely due to temperature-driven cracking of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Also, catalytic two-stage pyrolysis of MNS was performed at lower isothermal running temperature (500 °C) over Ni/SiO2 and Co/SiO2. The enhanced formation of syngas (H2 and CO) was observed from catalytic pyrolysis of MNS. Therefore, pyrolysis of MNS over Ni/SiO2 or Co/SiO2 could be a reliable platform for enhancing syngas formation at mild temperature (≤ 500 °C) under CO2 environment. In addition, all experimental findings suggested that the use of CO2 is beneficial in the WtE platform, and the use of CO2 could be a practical climate change mitigation measure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide; Catalytic pyrolysis; Macadamia nutshell; Syngas; Waste-to-energy","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Isotherms; Silicon compounds; Synthesis gas; Volatile organic compounds; Catalytic pyrolysis; Climate change mitigation; Macadamia nutshell; Mild temperatures; Non-catalytic; Sustainable waste; Syn-gas; Waste to energy; Pyrolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077199421

Impaired cerebrovascular carbon dioxide (CO2) reactivity is an independent predictor of ischemic stroke and cardiovascular mortality. We sought to test the hypothesis that cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity is reduced in South Asians. Middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCA Vm) was measured at rest and during stepwise changes in end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PETC O2) in South Asian (n = 16) and Caucasian European (n = 18) men who were young (~20 yr), healthy, and living in the United Kingdom. Incremental hypercapnia was delivered via the open-circuit steady-state method, with stages of 4 and 7% CO2 (~21% oxygen, nitrogen balanced). Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was calculated as the change in MCA Vm relative to the change in PETCO2. MCA Vm was not different in South Asians [59 (9) cm/s, mean (standard deviation)] and Caucasian Europeans [61 (12) cm/s; P &gt; 0.05]. Similarly, cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was not different between the groups [South Asian 2.53 (0.76) vs. Caucasian European 2.61 (0.81) cm·s-1·mmHg-1; P &gt; 0.05]. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation was lower in South Asians [5.48 (2.94)%] compared with Caucasian Europeans [7.41 (2.28)%; P &lt; 0.05]; however, when corrected for shear rate no between-group differences in flow-mediated dilation were observed (P &gt; 0.05). Flow-mediated dilation was not correlated with cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity measures. In summary, cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity and flow-mediated dilation corrected for shear rate are preserved in young healthy South Asian men living in the United Kingdom.

Schemes such as eco-industrial parks (EIPs) and sustainable cities have the purpose of enhancing the usage of the available resources through an exchange network where different resources are allocated among several industrial processes. Recently, the carbon-hydrogen-oxygen symbiosis networks (CHOSYNs) have been proposed as a special case of EIP, where the multiplant integration allows the exchange of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen compounds among hydrocarbon processing plants. Previous CHOSYN designs have been focused on determining the most suitable allocation of resources to satisfy the material requirements for each industrial plant and obtain the best economic result for the total integrated system. Notwithstanding, this result usually provides unfair solutions, where the biggest industries have the main economic advantages, leaving aside the profitability of the smallest industries. This paper evaluates distinct allocation schemes in the synthesis of CHOSYNs through an optimization approach to identify fair solutions to allocate the available resources. A mathematical formulation is presented for three different justice schemes to design the material exchange network: social welfare, Rawlsian justice, and Nash schemes. The addressed case study has been previously analyzed through the optimization of the total annual profit, which allows comparing the utilities of all of the plants when the allocation schemes are included.

The high torque and power requirements of heavy-duty trucks over a long operating range, the majority of which is at constant cruise point, along with a high payback period, complexity, cost, weight and range anxiety, make the hybrid and battery electric solution less attractive than a conventional powertrain. However, certain heavy-duty applications, such as Class 6-7 urban vocational trucks, can benefit from hybridization due to their transient operating profiles and relatively lower vehicle weight. While many studies have quantified the fuel consumption benefits of hybridization in this segment, very few studies have outlined the arduous process of selection and sizing of hybrid powertrain components based on the trade-offs between fuel consumption, payback period, cost, weight, packaging, emissions and aftertreatment temperature. To investigate the potential for electrification in heavy-duty applications, FEV has developed a system level approach for the selection and sizing of heavy-duty diesel hybrid powertrain components using GT-SUITE. The approach has been applied for a Class 6-7 urban vocational truck, which typically experiences low speed driving with frequent start-stops. A dynamic model for the baseline vehicle was developed and calibrated to test data that included, fuel efficiency, engine-out NOx, engine-out PM and aftertreatment system temperature. The model was then updated with hybrid powertrain components and evaluated over cycles developed for chassis dynamometer testing of heavy-duty vehicles, specifically the Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) schedule and EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (HDUDDS). In the evaluation, key trade-offs were identified between fuel consumption, initial cost, payback period, package size, emissions and vehicle weight. The trade-off analysis demonstrated that similar fuel consumption benefits with an identical payback period could be achieved with multiple hybrid powertrain configurations, however package size, initial cost and weight considerations determined the final optimum solution. The final hybrid powertrain configuration for a Class 6-7 urban vocational truck proposed from this study demonstrates a 20.7% fuel consumption reduction when comparing to the baseline vehicle and applying a two year payback period. In addition, the diesel hybrid powertrain configuration provides an 11% reduction in engine-out NOx emissions and an 86% reduction in engine-out PM emissions, while maintaining aftertreatment temperature of the baseline configuration. © 2020 SAE International.

This paper involved integrated assessments on GHG emissions and emergy of the life cycle for the internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric automobiles in the USA over the entire assumed fifteen-year lifetime. The hotspots of GHG emissions as well as emergy indices for the major processes of automobile life cycle within the defined system boundaries have been investigated. The potential strategies for reducing GHG emissions and emergy in the life cycle of both ICE and electric automobiles were further proposed. Based on the current results, the total GHG emissions from the life cycle of ICE automobiles are 4.48E + 07 kg CO2-e which is 320 times higher than that of the electric automobiles. The hotspot area of the GHG emissions from ICE and electric automobiles are operation phase and manufacturing process, respectively. Interesting results were observed that comparable total emergy of the ICE automobiles and electric automobiles have been calculated which were 1.54E + 17 and 2.20E + 17 sej, respectively. Analysis on emergy index evidenced a better environmental sustainability of electric automobiles than ICE automobiles over the life cycle due to its higher ESI. To the authors’ knowledge, it is the first time to integrate the analysis of GHG emissions together with emergy in industrial area of automobile engineering. It is expected that the integration of emergy and GHG emissions analysis may provide a comprehensive perspective on eco-industrial sustainability of automobile engineering. © 2020","Electric automobiles; Emergy; Emergy Index; Greenhouse gas emissions; Internal combustion engine automobiles","Automotive engineering; Combustion; Combustion equipment; Electric automobiles; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Ice; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Emergy; Emergy indices; Environmental problems; Environmental sustainability; Industrial sustainability; Integrated assessment; Manufacturing process; Transportation sector; Automobile engines; car; electricity; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; United States; Automobiles; Electricity; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077507183

Conventional approaches to obtain information on the parameters usually involve long-term field work, even for one leaf sample, and are, thus, only applicable to a small area. The utilization of hyperspectral remote sensing especially of various vegetation indices is a promising approach that has been attracting increasing attention recently. However, most hyperspectral indices are only applicable to a specific area and specific forest stands, depending heavily on the conditions from which the indices are developed. In this study, we tried to develop new hyperspectral indices for tracing the two critical photosynthetic parameters (the maximum rate of carboxylation, Vcmax and the maximum rate of electron transport, Jmax) that are at least generally applicable for alpine deciduous forests, based on original hyperspectral reflectance, first-order derivatives, and apparent absorption spectra. In total, ten types of hyperspectral indices were screened to identify the best indices, and their robustness was determined using the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) and Akaike's Information Criterion corrected (AICc). The result revealed that the double differences (DDn) type of indices using the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region based on the first-order derivatives spectra performed best among all indices. The specific DDn type of indices obtained the RPD values of 1.43 (R2 = 0.51) for Vcmax and 1.68 (R2 = 0.64) for Jmax, respectively. These indices have also been tested using the downscaled dataset to examine the possibilities of using hyperspectral data derived from satellite-based information. These findings highlight the possibilities of tracing photosynthetic capacity using hyperspectral indices. © 2020, by the authors.","Hyperspectral remote sensing; Photosynthetic capacity; Ratio of performance to deviation (RPD); Temperate forest; Vegetation indices","Carboxylation; Electron transport properties; Infrared radiation; Remote sensing; Akaike's information criterions; Conventional approach; First order derivatives; Hyperspectral reflectance; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Photosynthetic capacity; Photosynthetic parameters; Short wave infrared regions; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084250018

A methodology that combines geostatistical techniques and hydrological models to perform a preliminary assessment of global undercatch and precipitation patterns in alpine regions is proposed. An assessment of temperature and precipitation fields is performed by applying geostatistical approaches assuming diffierent hypothesis about the relationship between climatic fields and altitude. Several experiments using diffierent approximations of climatic fields in diffierent approaches to a hydrological model are evaluated. A new hydrological model, the Snow-Temez Model (STM), is developed including two parameters to correct the solid (Cs) and liquid precipitation (Cr). The procedure allows identifying the best combination of geostatistical approach and hydrological model for estimating streamflow in the Canales Basin, an alpine catchment of the Sierra Nevada (Spain). The sensitivity of the results to the correction of the precipitation fields is analyzed, revealing that the results of the streamflow simulation are improved when the precipitation is corrected considerably. High values of solid Cs are obtained, while Cr values, although smaller than the solid one, are also significant. © 2020 by the authors.","Alpine basin; Gradient of precipitation; Hydrological model; Sierra nevada; Snow model; Solid precipitation; Undercatch","Catchments; Forestry; Stream flow; Systematic errors; Geostatistical approach; Geostatistical techniques; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological models; Precipitation patterns; Preliminary assessment; Solid precipitation; Streamflow simulations; Climate models; alpine environment; assessment method; catchment; geostatistics; hydrological modeling; methodology; precipitation (climatology); precipitation assessment; streamflow; temperature effect; Andalucia; Betic Cordillera; Sierra Nevada [Betic Cordillera]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084543930

Investigating the transfer of DIC from karst waters to the atmosphere is important to further our understanding of carbon cycling in karst environments. There is still considerable uncertainty about the controls of DIC transfer in karst waters because of challenges associated with investigations that aim to mimic the continuum of changes in DIC concentrations to equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 in natural settings. Laboratory simulations can create controlled conditions that allow targeted investigations. In this study, four tanks were taken to investigate the variations of pCO2, DIC and δ13CDIC when karst spring-waters were exposed to the atmosphere from 40 to 360 h as: (1) agitated water containing Hydrilla verticillata; (2) static water containing Hydrilla verticillata; (3) agitated water without Hydrilla verticillata; and (4) static water without Hydrilla verticillata. The rates of photosynthesis/respiration of submerged plants, CO2 outgassing and carbonate precipitation/dissolution were quantified by a time-stepping chemical/isotopic mass balance model. This experiment was designed to create ideal conditions to estimate the temporal evolution of DIC and δ13CDIC, and investigate mechanisms that control their evolution when karst spring-waters interact with atmospheric CO2. Results show: (1) generally a steep decrease in DIC concentrations and δ13CDIC enrichment; (2) DIC loss and δ13CDIC enrichment are faster in the agitated waters with submerged plants; (3) DIC evolution is mainly controlled by the metabolism of aquatic plants; (4) carbonate precipitation/dissolution and CO2 outgassing has a lower effect on the DIC evolution in waters with submerged plants; (5) δ13CDIC evolution is mainly controlled by the metabolism of submerged plants; (6) CO2 evasion, photosynthesis and δ13CDIC enrichment are accelerated by the agitation of waters. Our analyses show that more than 40% of the total DIC resulting from carbonate weathering was used for photosynthesis by submerged aquatic plants thereby transforming the DIC into organic carbon (OC), suggesting that intense aquatic photosynthetic activities in continental surface water systems could play an important role as natural carbon sinks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biological process; Chemical process; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Karst spring-waters-atmosphere interaction; Physical process; Stable carbon isotope","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Dissolution; Groundwater; Landforms; Metabolism; Photosynthesis; Springs (water); Surface waters; Biological process; Chemical process; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Karst springs; Physical process; Stable carbon isotopes; Organic carbon; air-water interaction; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; carbon sink; concentration (composition); dissolved inorganic carbon; groundwater; laboratory method; stable isotope; Hydrilla verticillata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075445370

A timely investigation of the spatial distribution characteristics of subtropical forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential to assess forest carbon stocks. Lidar (light detection and ranging) is regarded as the most reliable data source for accurate estimation of forest AGB. However, previous studies that have used lidar data have often beenbased on a single model developed from the relationships between lidar-derived variables and AGB, ignoring the variability of this relationship in different forest types. Although stratification of forest types has been proven to be effective for improving AGB estimation, how to stratify forest types and how many strata to use are still unclear. This research aims to improve forest AGB estimation through exploring suitable stratification approaches based on lidar and field survey data. Different stratification schemes including non-stratification and stratifications based on forest types and forest stand structures were examined. The AGB estimation models were developed using linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF) approaches. The results indicate the following: (1) Proper stratifications improved AGB estimation and reduced the effect of under- and overestimation problems; (2) the finer forest type strata generated higher accuracy of AGB estimation but required many more sample plots, which were often unavailable; (3) AGB estimation based on stratification of forest stand structures was similar to that based on five forest types, implying that proper stratification reduces the number of sample plots needed; (4) the optimal AGB estimation model and stratification scheme varied, depending on forest types; and (5) the RF algorithm provided better AGB estimation for non-stratification than the LR algorithm, but the LR approach provided better estimation with stratification. Results from this research provide new insights on how to properly conduct forest stratification for AGB estimation modeling, which is especially valuable in tropical and subtropical regions with complex forest types. © 2020, by the authors.","Aboveground biomass; Forest types; Lidar; Linear regression; Random forest; Stratification; Subtropical forest","Carbon; Climate change; Decision trees; Forestry; Tropics; Aboveground biomass; Accurate estimation; Airborne lidar data; Distribution characteristics; Forest stand structure; LIDAR (light detection and ranging); Subtropical forests; Subtropical regions; Optical radar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084251075

Dissociation of H2O is known as key step to provide abundant protons for CO2 reduction. The sluggish kinetic of H2O dissociation on g-C3N4 restricts the generation of higher reduced-state hydrocarbon products. Herein, we designed holey g-C3N4 nanosheets with numerous surface defects by Ar plasma treatment. Density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations prove the Ar plasma-treated g-C3N4 (P-x-CN) exhibits better H2O adsorption and dissociation abilities than pure g-C3N4. The separation of photogenerated charge carriers in P-x-CN is also more efficient than pure g-C3N4, which offers higher density of surface photogenerated electrons. The probability of multiple electron reduction reactions to hydrocarbon products greatly increases.

A wise use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer is important for mitigating GHG emissions. To evaluate the potential of different fertilizers treatments to mitigate total GHG emissions, a field experiment was conducted to investigate nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3) emissions and nitrate (NO3 −) leaching from a typical rice and winter wheat rotation system in Southeast China. Six reduced N treatments (including single reducing N input, increasing potassium input, combined application of urea ammonium (UA) and organic fertilizer (OF), single application of urea with hydroquinone and dicyandiamide (UHD) and urea formaldehyde (UF)) and the local practice (conventional N fertilizer) were applied in the study. Most of the reduced N treatments tended to reduce the cumulative CH4, N2O and NH3 emissions and NO3 − leaching relative to the local practice, while single application of UHD during the rice season obviously increased the CH4 and NH3 emissions (p &lt; 0.05) and all of the reduced N treatments during the wheat season had no obvious mitigation effect on NO3 − leaching. Moreover, the single reducing N input and single application of UHD significantly decreased the rice yields (p &lt; 0.05), and the other treatments could maintain the yields. For the whole rice-wheat rotation system, only the single application of UHD significantly increased the GHG intensity (GHGI) by 22.0% (p &lt; 0.05) and reduced the N use efficiency (NUE) by 9.1% compared to the local practice and the other reduced N treatments reduced the GHGI by 11.0–42.7% and increased the NUE by 5.2–34.3%, especially the reducing local N input levels by 18–32% and increasing potassium input or combined application of UA and OF treatments, which had the obvious mitigation effects and should be given priority for total GHG mitigation in future crop production. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Combined application; Direct and indirect GHGs; GHGI; Lowering N input; Rice-wheat fields",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078845243

Here, we present a metal-organic framework (MOF) based catalyst to mitigate the technical problems associated with the above-mentioned features. We report a carbon-coated CuNi alloy nanocatalyst obtained by high temperature vacuum treatment of a MOF material (CuNiBTC). The resulting carbon encapsulated CuNi (denoted as CuNi/C) nanoparticles possess a well-designed core-shell composite structure with graphene shells. Meanwhile, we investigated the reaction mechanism of CO2 on the surface of the CuNi/C photocatalyst in an aqueous solution containing triethanolamine. The experimental results show that the activity and catalytic yield of CuNi/C are much higher than those of Cu/C and Ni/C alone. At the same time, the catalytic activity of CuNi/C is also affected by changing the reaction temperature in the preparation process. As a result, the CuNi/C samples can achieve nearly 90% selectivity for NIR-light-driven CO2 reduction to CO.

Here, we explored the trends and driving forces of land surface temperature (LST) along the urban-rural gradients of 26 cities in the largest urban agglomeration of China, the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration, using MODIS LST data combined with urban intensity, background climate, vegetation greenness, landscape structure, albedo, population and gross domestic product (GDP). We found that LST generally increased with increasing urban intensity along the urban-rural gradients while with large diurnal and seasonal variability. Large variability also existed between the maximum and minimum LST within the same urban intensity (e.g., 6.4 °C), suggesting cities themselves provide ready-made solutions (minimum) to resolving heat island problems. However, the range of LST within the same intensity decreased with the urban intensity and narrowed drastically when the intensity reached certain thresholds (e.g., 58–87% varying with season, time of day, and city), implying that the space for climate mitigation is very limited once the urbanization intensity exceeds critical thresholds. The roles of landscape structure (composition and configuration) for greenspace and urban land have become increasingly important in driving the variation of LST with increasing urban intensity from low (20%–30%), middle (45%–55%) to high (70%–80%), clearly indicating that subtle urban landscape designing, such as less aggregated urban configuration and more irregular greenspace shape are effective strategies to mitigate climate change in highly urbanized areas and cities themselves already provide such vivid demonstrations for us to find and learn. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Landscape structure; MODIS land surface temperature; Urban agglomeration; Urban-rural gradients","Agglomeration; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Land surface temperature; Population statistics; Radiometers; Rural areas; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Climate change mitigation; Gross domestic products; Highly urbanized areas; Landscape structures; Problems and Solutions; Seasonal variability; Urban agglomerations; Urban-rural gradients; Atmospheric temperature; agglomeration; climate change; land surface; landscape structure; MODIS; surface temperature; trend analysis; urban development; urbanization; article; China; city; climate change; gross national product; heat; human; rangeland; river; season; urban area; urbanization; vegetation; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076593766

In addition, under the framework of robust programming, the optimal solutions could provide tradeoff information between system cost and decision maker's risk preference. The hybrid programming method is tailored for a case study of Shandong Province, China to validate its applicability and provide useful managerial insights, where energy-water interactions are gain great concerns. The model helps to make robust strategies associated with risk control for capacity expansion, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology retrofitting, power generation, imported electricity, and water allocation for electricity generation, with the goal of minimizing total cost. Besides, considering the variation of water resource conditions and environmental policies under climate change, the impacts of water resource availability and carbon emission caps on regional electric power system planning are explored and discussed. It is found that stricter carbon emission cap policy would facilitate the investment on CCS devices but have little impact on the installed capacity structure, meanwhile it would increase water consumption per power generation. However, scarcer water resource situation would promote the development of renewable energy generation, and limit the investment on CCS technology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy-water nexus; Multi-stage programming; Power system planning; Robust; Uncertainties","Carbon capture; Climate change; Decision making; Electric power system interconnection; Environmental protection; Investments; Probability distributions; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Water management; Energy-water nexus; Multi-stage programming; Power system planning; Robust; Uncertainties; Electric power system planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076699435

A multi-stage stochastic fuzzy random programming (MSFRP) model is tailored to tackle variables with deeper uncertainties, a mixture of fuzzy and random fuzzy characteristics. Allowing to reflect decision makers’ subjective opinion and risk preference, it can provide decision makers the tradeoff information between system benefit and risk attitude. The proposed model was applied to an agricultural area Shandong Province, China with the aim of maximum total system benefits. The valuable managerial insights on optimal cultivated land distribution, water resource allocation, and energy supply strategies are provided for decision makers under uncertainties. Meanwhile, the pesticide and fertilizer consumption for crop planting, and the carbon emission embodied in per unit crop supply are also quantitatively estimated. Moreover, by setting different water resource availability scenarios, the impacts of future water resource conditions on optimal management strategies under climate change are evaluated and discussed. The results suggested that rice would be the critical crop with the largest planting area for food security during the planning horizon. Under scarcer water resource conditions, the system benefits would reduce due to more desalination water consumption and planting strategy adjustment. However, it would lead to less carbon emission embodied in per unit crop supply and relieve local carbon emission control pressure. Compared to the conventional multi-stage stochastic programming, the developed MSFRP can be more effective to reflect the optimistic and pessimistic attitude of decision makers and deal with future scenario information with deeper uncertainties. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Food-energy-water nexus; Multi-stage programming; Random fuzzy; Uncertainty","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Climate change; Crops; Desalination; Emission control; Food supply; Fuzzy systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Water resources; Fuzzy random programming; Multi-stage programming; Multi-stage stochastic programming; Optimal management strategy; Random fuzzy; Resource availability; Trade-off information; Uncertainty; Decision making; pesticide; energy use; food; future prospect; fuzzy mathematics; resource allocation; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; water resource; agricultural parameters; Article; carbon footprint; China; climate change; comparative study; crop production; cultivated land; desalination; energy resource; fertilizer application; food intake; food security; food water energy nexus; fuzzy system; irrigation (agriculture); multi stage stochastic fuzzy random programming; process development; quantitative analysis; reliability; resource allocation; risk assessment; risk benefit analysis; stochastic model; water supply; China; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077757439

Meanwhile, as the climate has a huge impact on building energy consumption, ECEs and OCEs should be investigated considering the climate. This study investigated the relation between ECEs and OCEs of buildings in different climate zones by conducting life cycle assessment and statistical analysis of 39 elementary school buildings in South Korea. As a result, the climate zone was determined to be the significant influence factors. The mean values of ECEs, OCEs, and LCCEs in central region were 611, 2,81 7, and 3,428 kg-CO2/m2, respectively, and those in southern region were 620, 1,652, and 2,273 kg-CO2/m2. The OCEs in central region was significantly higher than that in southern region, but the ECEs was not. In particular, ECEs and OCEs had a significant inverse correlation in central region but not in southern region. The results indicate that different strategies should be established depending on the climate zone. For instance, the thermal insulation levels should be further strengthened to reduce OCEs in central region compared to those of southern region. © 2020, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.","Carbon dioxide; Elementary school buildings; Embodied emission; Life cycle assessment; Operational emission","Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; School buildings; Thermal insulation; Building energy consumption; CO2 emissions; Elementary schools; Embodied emissions; Inverse correlation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mean values; South Korea; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080917103

In the face of the rapid growth of the production and demand of galvanized sheet in China, it is very important to find out the key factors of the environment impact in the production of galvanized sheet. An evaluation of the environmental impact of galvanized sheet production in China was conducted by using the framework of life cycle assessment to improve resource saving and environmental protection in the galvanized sheet industry, and update the life cycle inventory database of galvanized sheet production. Methods: The environmental impact assessment was carried out based on the life cycle assessment framework by the use of ReCiPe 2016 method which was applicable on a global scale to evaluate the environmental impact of galvanized sheet production. Methods of uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis were adopted to provide credible support. Results and discussion: The midpoint categories of global warming and fossil resource scarcity, as well as the endpoint categories of human health contributed most to environmental burden, which were mainly caused by carbon dioxide emissions and coal consumption. Environmental impact was dominated by the key process of continuous casting billet production, followed by electrolytic zinc production and electricity generation. Conclusions: Additional CO2-reducing measures should be implemented in galvanized sheet production to slow the effect of global warming. Moreover, biomass char reducing agents, rather than coal-based reducing agents, should be utilized in steelmaking to reduce fossil resource consumption. Furthermore, renewable energy, rather than coal-based electricity, should be used in galvanized sheet production to reduce carbon emissions and fossil resource consumption. Increasing the recycling rate of scrap steel and zinc waste can save resources and reduce environmental burden.

The results showed that biochar achieved higher nutrient removal and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than ceramsite while supporting more diverse bacterial communities and higher abundances of functional taxa. Both IA and TF effectively enhanced nutrient removal, though the latter was more efficient and practical, and aeration conditions greatly influenced nutrient removal efficiency. GHG emissions were decreased by IA but were slightly increased by TF. Both oxygen supply methods significantly shaped the biofilm microbial communities and influenced biodiversity and richness, with observably higher proportions of potential nitrifiers and denitrifiers present in aerated CWs.

The critical step in the reductive process is the coordination of CO2 to an alkali metal anion, forming a metal carbonite MCO2- able to subsequently receive a second CO2 molecule. While the energetic demand for these reactions is generally low, we find that the degree of activation of CO2 in terms of charge transfer and transition state energies is the highest for lithium and systematically decreases down the group (M = Li-Cs). This is correlated to the strength of the binding interaction between the alkali metal and CO2, which can be related to the structure of the oxalate moiety within the product metal complexes evolving from a planar to a staggered conformer with increasing atomic number of the interacting metal. Similar structural changes are observed for crystalline alkali metal oxalates, although the C2O42- moiety is in general more planar in these, a fact that is attributed to the increased number of interacting alkali metal cations compared to the gas-phase ions.

Krakow is one of the most affected cities in the EU by air pollution mostly caused by burning solid fuels in households' furnaces. It is considered that the most effective remedies would be adequate spatial planning solutions and application of low-emission sources including renewable energy sources (RES). This article draws from the analysis of the use of RES as a means for reducing harmful emissions in Krakow Functional Area (KrOF). The inventories of renewable energy sources and systems were compiled by the authors as a part of the EU project “Smart Edge-Sustainable Metropolitan Areas and the Role of The Edge City”. Using the data from the inventories, a SWOT analysis has been carried out to identify factors that determine the smart management of the RES potential, particularly the decisions of households on the transition towards RES. The results of the analysis have shown that many actions have been taken at the national, regional, and local levels but the greatest influence bear the solutions initiated and implemented at the communal level. The conclusion is that legislative regulations should be combined with locally tailor-made instruments. The proposed method of analysis can be applied in other metropolitan areas as a diagnostic procedure supporting action planning to solve air-quality problems caused by distributed emission sources. © 2020 by the authors.

This has led to an increase in production of biodiesel which is produced from palm oil. However, as palm oil is also used for food, it is important to take this into consideration as well. Also, oil palm cultivation is rather water-intensive. Hence, it is necessary to analyze the interlinkage between water, food, and energy to have a holistic understanding and prevent trade-offs when addressing one issue in isolation. The water-energy-food nexus for oil palm cultivation in Thailand has been conducted following two widely used methods, the Water-Food-Energy Nexus (WFEN) and Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus assessment method. The results are demonstrated as a single score, which is easier for suggesting a suitable area for oil palm plantation. The assessment indicates the southern region of Thailand is the most suitable for oil palm plantation. The recommendation is consistent with the suggestion of the government, based on land and climate suitability. However, this study considers more comprehensive aspects including various other environmental aspects. Oil palm cultivation mainly relates to the amount of freshwater consumption, leading to the increment of fuel consumption for pumping water. On the other hand, the effectiveness of fresh fruit bunch yield (for food and energy production) should be developed in the future. Besides, the results recommend the central region for the expansion of oil palm cultivation in the future because of the availability of a good irrigation infrastructure. © 2020","Oil palm plantation; Quantitative nexus results; Water-Food-Energy nexus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082840746

Madrid is one of the cities where traffic causes high NO2 levels. In this context, Madrid City Council launched the Air Quality and Climate Change Plan for the city of Madrid (Plan A), a local strategy approved by the previous government in 2017. The aim of this study was to conduct a quantitative health impact assessment to evaluate the number of premature deaths that could potentially be prevented by the implementation of Plan A in Madrid in 2020, at both citywide and within-city level. The main purpose was to support decision-making processes in order to maximize the positive health impacts from the implementation of Plan A measures. Methods: The Regional Statistical Office provided information on population and daily mortality in Madrid. For exposure assessment, we estimated PM2.5, NO2 and O3 concentration levels for Madrid city in 2012 (baseline air-quality scenario) and 2020 (projected air-quality scenario based on the implementation of Plan A), by means of an Eulerian chemical-transport model with a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km and 30 vertical levels. We used the concentration-response functions proposed by two relevant WHO projects to calculate the number of attributable annual deaths corresponding to all non-accidental causes (ICD-10: A00-R99) among all-ages and the adult population (&gt;30 years old) for each district and for Madrid city overall. This health impact assessment was conducted dependant on health-data availability. Results: In 2020, the implementation of Plan A would imply a reduction in the Madrid citywide annual mean PM2.5 concentration of 0.6 μg/m3 and 4.0 μg/m3 for NO2. In contrast, an increase of 1 μg/m3 for O3 would be expected. The annual number of all-cause deaths from long-term exposure (95% CI) that could be postponed in the adult population by the expected air-pollutant concentration reduction was 88 (57–117) for PM2.5 and 519 (295–750) for NO2; short-term exposure accounted for 20 (7–32) for PM2.5 and 79 (47–111) for NO2 in the total population. According to the spatial distribution of air pollutants, the highest mortality change estimations were for the city centre – including Madrid Central and mainly within the M-30 ring road –, as compared to peripheral districts.

The integrated model and the results produced are intended to raise awareness and facilitate discussion with and amongst stakeholders. New hydrological insights: The modelling illustrates that improved farm level knowledge and management with regard to crop water requirements, soil water capacity, and irrigations are the most significant factors towards achieving outcomes that are robust to a range of climate and water policy futures. Assuming farmer management with regard to these factors are at their most optimal, increasing irrigation efficiency alone did not lead to improved farm profitability and ecological outcomes under drier climate conditions. Likelihood of achieving robust outcomes were further improved through the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater, with increased consideration of groundwater use a key factor. Further discussion on the viability and impact of increased groundwater use and conjunctive use policies should be further considered. © 2020 The Authors","Conjunctive water use; Exploratory modelling; Integrated modelling; Participatory modelling; Scenario discovery",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079656769

This article examines for the first time the differences in household economies of scale across EU countries as a way to support reductions in energy use and GHG emissions, while considering differences in effects across consumption domains and urban-rural typology. A country-comparative analysis is important to facilitate the formulation of context-specific initiatives and policies for resource sharing. We find that one-person households are most carbon- and energy-intensive per capita with an EU average of 9.2 tCO2eq/cap and 0.14 TJ/cap, and a total contribution of about 17% to the EU's carbon and energy use. Two-person households contribute about 31% to the EU carbon and energy footprint, while those of five or more members add about 9%. The average carbon and energy footprints of an EU household of five or more is about half that of a one-person average household, amounting to 4.6 tCO2eq/cap and 0.07 TJ/cap. Household economies of scale vary substantially across consumption categories, urban-rural typology and EU countries. Substantial household economies of scale are noted for home energy, real estate services and miscellaneous services such as waste treatment and water supply; yet, some of the weakest household economies of scale occur in high carbon domains such as transport. Furthermore, Northern and Central European states are more likely to report strong household economies of scale-particularly in sparsely populated areas-compared to Southern and Eastern European countries. We discuss ways in which differences in household economies of scale may be linked to social, political and climatic conditions. We also provide policy recommendations for encouraging sharing within and between households as a contribution to climate change mitigation. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Commercial multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), graphene oxide (GO) platelets and ZnO nanoparticles were used as starting materials. We discuss the influence of carbon/metal oxide ratio on the physico-chemical properties of the nanohybrid layers, geometrical characteristics, shape and dimensions of constituent nanoentities, chemical composition and chemical bonding states, optical properties, UV–visible absorption, band gap values, as well as charge transfer properties. In the followings the relation between these properties and functional characteristics, removal of water contaminants, antibiotic molecules, and charge storage performances of the ternary, MWCNTs/reduced GO/ZnO layers are presented, identifying the optimum relative concentrations of the constituting nanomaterials. The high photocatalytic efficiencies both under UV and visible light irradiations, even after several consecutive degradation cycles, were attributed to effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers by carbon nanomaterials as well as formation of oxygen deficient ZnOx−1 nanocrystals. The enhanced charge storage capacity of ternary nanohybrid electrodes is based on combined electrochemical double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance implying redox reactions on the surface and subsurface of the layers in contact with the electrolyte.

The oxidized atmosphere implied by the Mn-rich rocks would basically be comprised of CO2 and H2O without any reduced greenhouse gases such as H2 and CH4. So far, however, it has been thought that early Mars could not have been warm enough to sustain water in liquid form without the presence of reduced greenhouse gases. Here, we propose that H2O2 could have been the gas responsible for warming the surface of the oxidized early Mars. Our one-dimensional atmospheric model shows that only 1 ppm of H2O2 is enough to warm the planetary surface because of its strong absorption at far-infrared wavelengths, in which the surface temperature could have reached over 273 K for a CO2 atmosphere with a pressure of 3 bar. A wet and oxidized atmosphere is expected to maintain sufficient quantities of H2O2 gas in its upper atmosphere due to its rapid photochemical production in slow condensation conditions. Our results demonstrate that a warm and wet environment could have been maintained on an oxidized early Mars, thereby suggesting that there may be connections between its ancient atmospheric redox state and possible aqueous environment. © 2020.

Dipterocarpus turbinatus, locally known as garjan, is a valuable but vulnerable native tree species of Bangladesh whose spatial distribution under future climate change scenarios is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of present and future climatic scenarios on spatiotemporal distribution of D. turbinatus. We used maximum entropy species distribution modeling to perform the present and future habitat suitability of garjan under different climate scenarios. The representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 were considered for bioclimatic variables from the Global Climate Model–Hadley Global Environment Model 2 Atmosphere-Ocean. The predictive accuracy of the model was more than 97% in both the training and test data. The prediction results suggest that compared to present areas (7624 km2) under moderate habitat class it will be 2755 km2 and 1239 km2, respectively, in 2050 and 2070 under RCP2.6 scenario and decreases more rapidly under RCP8.5 scenario.

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Cambridge, MA  02138, United States","Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering is a proposal to artificially thicken the layer of reflective aerosols in the stratosphere and it is hoped that this may offer a means of reducing average climate changes. However, previous work has shown that it could not perfectly offset the effects of climate change and there is a concern that it may worsen climate impacts in some regions. One approach to evaluating this concern is to test whether the absolute magnitude of climate change at each location is significantly increased (exacerbated) or decreased (moderated) relative to the period just preceding deployment. In prior work it was found that halving warming with an idealized solar constant reduction would substantially reduce climate change overall, exacerbating change in a small fraction of places. Here, we test if this result holds for a more realistic representation of stratospheric aerosol geoengineering using the data from the geoengineering large ensemble (GLENS). Using a linearized scaling of GLENS we find that halving warming with stratospheric aerosols moderates important climate hazards in almost all regions. Only 1.3% of land area sees exacerbation of change in water availability, and regions that are exacerbated see wetting not drying contradicting the common assumption that solar geoengineering leads to drying in general. These results suggest that halving warming with stratospheric aerosol geoengineering could potentially reduce key climate hazards substantially while avoiding some problems associated with fully offsetting warming. © 2020 The Author(s).

In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) published updated air quality guidelines for a number of air pollutants (including PM10 and PM2.5), which recommended for particulate matter annual average concentration levels at half or less the limit values set by European legislation. In the European Union, around 80% of the European urban population is exposed to air pollution above the levels recommended by the WHO guidelines. Only in 2015 the WHO addressed for the first time the topic of the health impacts of air pollution in its general assembly, which adopted a resolution clearly defining air pollution as the world’s largest single environmental health risk factor. Nowadays, the WHO considers air pollution as a major public health threat, causing a 7% increase in overall mortality for each increase of 10 μg/m3 in annual average of PM2.5. This result has been achieved thanks to the outstanding efforts of the director of the WHO’s Environment and Public Health Department, Dr. Maria Neira, who has devoted her full commitment to highlighting the consequences that air pollution has on people’s health. More recently, at European level, the Air Quality Directive has been subject to a fitness check, published in 2019; the European Green Deal has since announced its aim to align EU air quality standards more closely with the WHO recommendations. Every year, the European Environment Agency (EEA) publishes its “Air Quality in Europe” Report to assess the figures on air pollution across Europe and related health impacts. However, environmental data provided by official regional or national agencies—used by decision makers to adopt preventive measures such as limitations on urban traffic or domestic heating—refer to legal thresholds established by the law (usually on the basis of values set at European level, at least for the EU). These legal thresholds, however, are not adequate to fully protect population against all impacts from air pollution as recommended by WHO and scientific evidence. Therefore, we point out the need for a medical reading of environmental monitoring data that should be performed both at national and regional or local level by health authorities, to foster population health protection against air pollution and guarantee the application of the precautionary principle. A stronger cooperation between environmental agencies and health authorities is needed to address the new challenges to human and planetary health arising from air pollution and climate change. Health authorities should integrate their medical staff with new professionals and researchers with adequate training in environmental sciences to foster population health protection against air pollution. For this purposes, multi-disciplinary research units or teams should be established by local health authorities on environmental health topics, working together with medical staff and environmental agencies for a mutual integration of competencies. © 2020 by the authors.

XIII Koto Kampar in Riau Province indirectly was a form of community participation as one of the efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Interview methods and questionnaires with the community were used to find out the primary purpose of the city in developing agroforestry on their land and to know the perception and knowledge of the community on the role of agroforestry in climate change mitigation efforts. Land utilization with agroforestry patterns has been applied 25% of respondents, but the area of land used as agroforestry was still relatively small at 10% with the dominant types of plants are rubber, agarwood, and durian. The results showed that most people developed agroforestry patterns with two or more types because this pattern is more profitable regarding fulfilling the needs of short-term and longterm life. From an economic standpoint, the community developed rubber plants that are combined with other crops that have commercial value with the primary objective as an additional income especially with frequent fluctuations in the prices of the planted commodities. Meanwhile, regarding the environment, agroforestry has a vital role in protecting flora and fauna, protecting the environment, and reducing global warming. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economic analysis; Global warming; Land use; Rubber; Surveys; Agroforestry; Climate change mitigation; Community participation; Economic standpoints; Land utilization; Management systems; Primary objective; Short term; Agriculture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084059442

Indonesia aims to attain an efficient energy system by applying renewable energy tariffs that are lower than the cost of fossil fuel-generated electricity. However, the effectiveness of this policy is questionable, as renewable energy investments under previous premium feed-in tariffs did not meet expectations. This study aims to estimate generation costs from renewable energy expansions under three scenarios, namely existing power plant planning, and 11% and 14% emission reductions in Indonesia's electricity sector. We develop an agent-based model (ABM) tool called PowerGen-ABM that employs multi-approaches: linear programming and input-output analysis. The optimisation result shows that the emission reduction targets would increase the average electricity generation costs in 2028 from 65.3 USD/ MWh in the existing plan of power plant expansions to 68.3 USD/ MWh. The increased costs are caused by insufficient dispatchable renewables in several regions such as North Maluku. Renewable energy production share in total electricity production and emission reduction achievement of the existing plan in 2025 will be 22.8% and 6.5% below the targets of 23% and 11%, respectively. In contrast, the emission reduction scenarios could achieve those targets due to higher renewables productions, especially with wind energy from 5,268 GWh in the existing plan into anywhere between 64,472 to 75,085 GWh. Several policy implications are discussed based on these findings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"alternative energy; electricity generation; emission control; linear programing; power plant; wind power; achievement; article; electric power plant; electricity; environmental impact; Indonesia; system analysis; wind power; electric power plant; environment; renewable energy; wind; Indonesia; North Maluku; Electricity; Environment; Indonesia; Power Plants; Renewable Energy; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076201580

The process interconnects a microwave-induced plasma reactor and a methanol synthesis fixed-bed reactor. The paper explores the CO2 hydrogenation process in the microwave-induced plasma reactor via an unsteady-state, two-dimensional (2-D) axisymmetric, nonisothermal model and the catalytic methanol synthesis in the fixed-bed reactor via an unsteady-state, two-scale, isothermal model, highlighting the impact of key parameters on the integrated process performance. In the microwave-induced plasma reactor, CO2 conversion reaches 82% when the reactor is supplied with only H2 and CO2 and 74% when H2 is supplied in the diesel engine exhaust (H2/CO2 ratio = 3). However, this enhanced CO2 conversion at large H2/CO2 ratios is achieved by increasing the power of microwave plasma to compensate for the temperature drop induced by the amplified radial heat transport and radiative wall heat transfer. The specific energy input required to achieve a reasonable CO2 conversion is close to the specific energy input of the conventional thermal catalytic process for H2/CO2 = 1 and when H2 is supplied in the diesel engine exhaust. A large specific energy input into plasma reactor allows for high CO2 conversion and low energy efficiency. Methanol synthesis process in the fixed-bed reactor is improved by the amplification of H2/COx ratio and when CO2 is progressively substituted by CO, which is easily achieved via the reverse water-gas shift reaction in a microwave-induced plasma reactor located upstream from the methanol synthesis reactor. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical reactors; Chemical shift; Diesel engines; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Heat transfer; Hydrogenation; Methanol; Microwaves; Plasma applications; Plasma theory; Plasma waves; Synthesis gas manufacture; Water gas shift; Isothermal modeling; Methanol synthesis reactors; Microwave-induced plasmas; Non-isothermal models; Process performance; Reverse water-gas shift reaction; Specific energy input; Two Dimensional (2 D); Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074660732

There is a gap in the literature addressing all of these countries while using novel modeling to try and understand dynamic relationships across countries. In this study we use multiple models to examine data covering the years 2000 to 2014 starting with novel Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) models to compute the weights and ranking of countries based on CO2 emission. Next, using a Conservative (maximin) model, we check which country has the most CO2 emission issues among all countries based on weights obtained by Second Synthetic Grey Relational Analysis (SSGRA). Finally, a Grey preference by similarity to ideal solution (G-TOPSIS) methodology prioritizes the factors that have more intensely impact CO2 emissions. The results reveal that among all SAARC countries, India has substantial CO2 emission issues. We also find reductions in emissions from renewable energy consumption and the adoption of ISO 14001 certification in these countries.

Rather than compare veto actors across different states as is already extensively addressed, this article compares the different veto actors involved in Australia's 2011 Carbon Tax Policy and its 2014 “Carbon Tax Repeal” policy. It uses quantitative data to measure the number, ideological congruence, and individual cohesion of the different veto actors. The results show that, because of the smaller number of veto actors, their higher ideological congruence, and lower individual cohesion, policy making was rather drastic than incremental for the 2014 repeal policy compared to the 2011 Carbon Tax Policy. The results, however, challenge the assumption that many veto actors hinder effective policy change and suggest that because a single or few veto actors can easily execute drastic policy making, they can likewise easily halt effective policy. These have implications for policy making.

Operational problems of solar power harnessing in cities such as high land costs and dust accumulation on the panels are obviated by installing solar panels on the otherwise rooftop area of the urban buses. Furthermore, the fuel consumption and hazardous emissions of buses decrease by improving their aerodynamic performance. An integrated solar power and aerodynamic model is developed, validated, and employed in a multi-objective optimization algorithm to compare proposed single-part (SiPS) and separate-part (SePS) systems. A multi-level stochastic procedure is applied to obtain a robust plan, calculate the economic payback, and study the feasibility of the optimal system's application using a novel combined economic-environmental ratio in Tabriz metropolitan city. The results showed that the costs of energy and vehicle-specific power were 0.922 $/kWh and 0.864 $/kWh, and −12.71 kW/t and −17.53 kW/t for the optimal SiPS and SePS, respectively. Moreover, 233.76 MWh/year green energy could be generated, 1132 tCO2-eq/year hazardous emissions could be reduced, and 398,400 US$ land costs could be saved by retrofitting the bus rapid transport routes in Tabriz with the SePS. Although the project was recommended if the energy unit price was greater than 0.25 $/kWh in the case study, it was profitable under almost all probable conditions considering the combined economic-environmental revenue. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aerodynamic model; Climate change; Multi-objective optimization; Solar bus system; Tabriz metropolitan city; Techno-econo-environmental feasibility analysis","Aerodynamics; Buses; Climate change; Climate models; Economic analysis; Hazards; Multiobjective optimization; Phosphorus compounds; Retrofitting; Selenium compounds; Silicon compounds; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Stochastic systems; Transportation routes; Urban transportation; Aero-dynamic performance; Aerodynamic modeling; Bus systems; Climate change mitigation; Environmental feasibility; Metropolitan cities; Urban transportation systems; Vehicle specific power; Sulfur compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076677756

Such limitations may occur in some areas of the North American boreal forest where precipitation is low and warming trends are high. This paper analyzes climatic factors that limit the growth of a commercially important and widespread boreal tree species, white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), based on a range-wide dendroclimatological analysis of 9795 trees from 227 sample sites across the North American boreal forest. A bootstrapped response function analysis was conducted for monthly temperature and precipitation variables, and a multivariate regression tree analysis was used to group white spruce populations with similar response coefficients where climatic factors explained 46% of the total variance in response coefficients. The results of this study show that white spruce populations in the west-central boreal forest of North America are the most precipitation-limited group and therefore likely to be most susceptible to climate change. Populations both to the north and south of this group appear less vulnerable, and eastern populations generally do not experience growth-limiting moisture deficits. Regional climate change projections suggest that moisture limitations will become more pronounced in the future, especially for southwest and west-central boreal tree populations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Boreal; Climate change; Dendrochronology; Dendroclimatology; White spruce","Factor analysis; Forestry; Moisture; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Boreal; Dendrochronology; Dendroclimatology; Forest productivity; Multivariate regression trees; Regional climate changes; Response coefficient; White spruce; Climate change; boreal forest; climate change; coniferous tree; dendrochronology; dendroclimatology; environmental factor; evapotranspiration; mortality; regression analysis; Analysis Of Variance; Forestry; Moisture; Picea Glauca; Regression Analysis; Trees; North America; Picea glauca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078973940

Vehicles in Greater Yangon were relatively new but recent use of leaded gasoline caused deactivation of catalytic converters that bring about high emission factors (EFs) of CO, VOC and NOx from gasoline-powered vehicles. Pre-Euro diesel-powered buses and trucks were high PM emitters while pre-Euro and Euro1 gasoline vehicles were high emitters of CO and VOC. Composite EFs of CO and VOC were the highest for PU (45.1 and 3.2 g/km, respectively) followed by taxi (34.2 and 2.6 g/km, respectively). CNG vehicles with their small number and low EFs contributed the least to total on-road traffic emissions.

Therefore, it is crucial to tackle global warming because of its serious repercussions such as extreme changes in global weather, which can significantly impact human health and ecosystem. Global warming is caused by the emissions of greenhouse gases; therefore, many countries have established laws and policies to lessen the emissions of greenhouse gases. This study highlights the recently published articles and patents on CO2 capture technologies through adsorption process from the year 2014–2018. Various types of adsorbent that can be potentially used to capture CO2 are discussed. The published patents were obtained from the Derwent World Patents Index and it was found that over 500 patents have been published on the diverse categories of adsorbents which can be used to capture CO2. The top five countries in the world with patents for CO2 capture technology via adsorption are China, United States, World Intellectual Property Organisation, Japan and Korea.

In New York State (NYS), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration continues to decrease due to anthropogenic emission reductions and regulatory initiatives in recent years. Smoke aerosols, however, are projected to increase, making them the dominant source of PM2.5. Thus, the influences of smoke aerosols could become more important in the future. In this study, the long-range transport of smoke aerosols, and their impacts on local air quality over NYS in mid-August 2018 were investigated using satellite measurements, ground-based networks, and model products. Satellite measurements showed extensive fire activities over the northwestern United States (US) during August 8th – 10th. Air quality monitoring sites in NYS reported a threefold increase in average PM2.5 concentration (from 8.4 ± 3.4 μg m−3 to 24.8 ± 4.0 μg m−3) on August 15th – 16th, while the ground-based profiler network detected aerosol layers at 2–5 km across the state. Analysis of backward trajectories revealed that the plumes originated from wildfires, transported through southern Canada and arrived at the east coast during a period of 5–7 days. The increased PM2.5 in NYS can be attributed to boundary layer entrainment and vertical mixing of the aloft transported smoke aerosols down to the surface. The NYS mesoscale weather network (NYSM), which is originally designed for severe weather monitoring, demonstrate the capability to probe the lower atmosphere and provide the vertical extent information of air pollutants. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Boundary; Layer entrainment; Long-range transport; Smoke; Wildfire","Aerosols; Air entrainment; Air quality; Boundary layers; Emission control; Fires; Network layers; Air quality monitoring; Anthropogenic emissions; Boundary; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Long range transport; Northwestern United States; Satellite measurements; Wildfire; Smoke; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; entrainment; long range transport; particulate matter; pollutant transport; smoke; vertical mixing; wildfire; aerosol; air quality; article; boundary layer; Canada; New York; plume; seashore; severe weather; smoke; summer; wildfire; Canada; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082177762

Traffic contributes to the emissions of both carbon dioxide (CO2), affecting climate, and particulate matter (PM), affecting atmospheric chemistry and human health. While the development of city infrastructure is not in the hands of individuals, it is their transport mode choices that constitute traffic. In this scoping review we analyse 108 initiatives from around the world potentially influencing individual travel behaviour and producing changes in the shares of different transport modes (modal shifts). The targets, types and techniques of initiatives are identified. Examples of economic, regulative, structural and persuasive initiatives are included. Special focus is on whether the impacts on CO2 emissions, PM emissions and/or PM concentrations have been quantitatively evaluated, and on the quality and results of the evaluations. We observe that a variety of targets can motivate actions that lead to modal shifts and emission reductions. The results indicate that the level of atmospheric evaluations is low: absolute or relative changes in emissions and/or concentrations had been evaluated for only 31% (N = 34) of the reviewed initiatives, with substantial heterogeneity in quality. Sanctions, such as congestion charge and restrictions, have more likely been evaluated in peer reviewed analyses than incentives. Scientific evaluations of impacts on ambient PM concentrations are especially scarce (N = 4), although Air Quality is the primary target of 13% of actions and secondary target for at least 12%. We discuss the determinants of success and failure, when it comes to different types of initiatives, emission reductions and evaluations. A high-quality evaluation of atmospheric impacts captures the following: correct data about the modal shift (rate and direction), exclusion of external factors affecting the shift and emissions, and possible indirect impacts of the shift. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Behaviour change; Climate change; Incentives; Sanctions; Traffic emissions","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Behavioral research; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Particulate emissions; Traffic congestion; Atmospheric impact; Behaviour changes; Incentives; Sanctions; Scientific evaluations; Traffic emissions; Transport mode choices; Urban environments; Quality control; air quality; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; incentive; particulate matter; traffic emission; transportation mode; urban area; air pollution control; air quality; concentration (parameter); economic aspect; environmental impact; exhaust gas; government regulation; human; particulate matter; priority journal; Review; traffic and transport; travel; urban area",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078946259

The emission concentrations of particulate matter, fluoride,NOX and SO2were measured in the flue gas whilepolychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans(PCDD/Fs) were tested in both flue gas and dust ash at 100% and 60% loadconditions. The collections and analyses ofpollutantswere used by smoke sampler, TESTO350 and dioxin sampleraccording to national standards of China. The results shown that the average emission concentration of particulate matter, fluoride, NOX and SO2 in the inlet of the flue gas purification system were 47.4 mg/m3, 0.12 mg/m3, 150 mg/m3 and 521 mg/m3 while the emission concentrations in the outlet were 1.2 mg/m3, 0.07 mg/m3, 24 mg/m3 and 20 mg/m3,respectively. Through the flue gas purification system, the PCDD/Fs concentrations were reduced from 23.12 ng/m3to 1.14 ng/m3at100% load and from 12.25 ng/m3 to 0.84 ng/m3at60% load. The PCDD/Fs concentrations in the dust ash were about 178.56~197.21 ng/kg. Thedesulfurization and denitrification system significant reduced effect on the emission of particulate matter, fluoride, NOX, SO2 and PCDD/Fs with the value 97.5%, 41.7%, 84.0%, 96.2% and 95.1% at 100% load, respectively.The removal affects increases along the chlorination degree of PCDD/Fs. Meanwhile,the different load influenced the emission concentrations and removal rates of PCDD/Fs in the flue gas, the removal effects increases as the load increases. Although the desulfurization and denitrification system has good removal effects on various pollutants, the dioxins were enriched in the dust ashso as to cause secondary pollution. © 2020 SYSCOM 18 S.R.L..

Here we report on analysis of the 1-9 Å region, especially well suited for Chandra, which has a significant contribution from continuum emission between well separated emission lines from high-ionization species. These data allow us to study the hottest plasma present through the continuum shape and emission line strengths. Assuming a power-law emission measure distribution that has a higherature cutoff, we find that the emission is consistent with a thermal spectrum having a maximum temperature of 12 MK as determined from the corresponding spectral cutoff. This implies an effective wind shock velocity of 900 km s-1, well below the wind terminal speed of 2250 km s-1. For X-ray emission that forms close to the star, the speed and X-ray flux are larger than can be easily reconciled with strictly self-excited line-deshadowing-instability models, suggesting a need for a fraction of the wind to be accelerated extremely rapidly right from the base.

As a market-based policy, emission trading policy is widely considered an effective means to achieve the doublewin of economic development and environmental protection. Under such circumstances, carbon trading markets are developing rapidly in many countries and regions, demanding more attention to compliance strategy issues for emission-intensive companies. In this study, we build a dynamic programming model in search of the optimal emission trading and technology investment decisions for a make-to-order company faced with a stochastic demand under emission trading policy. After a comprehensive analysis of the proposed model, we find that an optimal emission permit level, which increases in carbon penalty and decreases in carbon price, exists in each period. As for the abatement technology investment decision, the firm should invest only if the investment cost per unit of abatement effort is less than a certain threshold, which increases in carbon penalty and carbon price. On the basis of a two-period dynamic programming model, we further explore the problem of investment timing. Results show how optimal investment decisions are influenced by the speed of technology progress under different parameters. These findings are important for firms to choose the time of investment depending on specific situations. © 2020, Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","compliance strategy; emission trading; investment-timing; Low-carbon","Carbon; Dynamic programming; Economics; Emission control; Global warming; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Abatement technologies; Compliance strategies; Comprehensive analysis; Dynamic programming model; Optimal investment decision; Optimal technology; Technology investments; Technology progress; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083081133

Current understanding of species distribution patterns and broad-scale species assemblages of heritage trees is limited. This study analyzed the diversity, distribution patterns, and origins of heritage trees and assessed the underlying factors contributing to their occurrence at the national scale in China. Data were drawn from published and online sources representing 561 regions across China. There were 1140 species including 105 endangered ones preserved as heritage trees. Heritage trees originated from four sources of species provenance: natural forest species 73.51 % of total species), native ruderal species (10.53 %), domesticated species (6.75 %) and exotic species (9.21 %). The origin of heritage trees differed across climatic zones. At the national and climatic zone scale, species similarity (Jaccard Index) among regions was low, constrained by geographic distance, climate (e.g., mean annual precipitation) and anthropogenic factors (e.g., population density). Mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, population density and GDP per capita were the main determinants of species provenance. Most heritage tree species serve tangible uses, especially domesticated and exotic species. Species assemblages of heritage trees were mainly associated with the local plant species pool, climate, socio-economic development status and human preference. As living heritage, the trees need dedicated protection measures based on their main tangible and cultural values for human, primary threats, and statutory protection degree at the species level. Regional culture, belief, and customary laws should be considered in formulating policies for protection and conservation of these trees. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Conservation; Human influence; Spatial heterogeneity; Species assemblage; Species origin","anthropogenic effect; biogeography; conservation planning; Gross Domestic Product; heterogeneity; population density; population distribution; spatial analysis; tree; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081687858

Among them, the clean energy transformation is very crucial. This study evaluates the impact of a set of policies including the development of renewable energy, upgrading heavy industry, and energy efficiency improvement on China's income gap between 2012 and 2050. A dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with detailed representations of economic activity, an upgraded labor market and disaggregated labor types based on statistical and survey data is used. Our research provides support for the necessity of low-carbon policies to achieve NDC targets. Results show some key findings. First, low-carbon policies have the greatest impact on employment across all energy industries, with negative impacts in most traditional energy sectors and positive impacts in most renewable power sectors. Second, labor will continue to migrate from rural to urban areas with the transformation of the economic structure and the urbanization rate will further increase, reaching a maximum of around 70%. The reduction of the rural population will bring new opportunities for the modernization of agriculture, increasing the income of rural residents and realizing the equitable development between urban and rural areas. Third, the income gap among urban residents will widen due to the different level of labor demand for employees with different education levels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model; Income gap; Labor market; NDC targets","Carbon; Commerce; Employment; Energy efficiency; Computable general equilibrium model; Economic activities; Energy efficiency improvements; Income gap; Labor markets; Low-carbon development; Low-carbon policies; Urban and rural areas; Rural areas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076533125

The current EPT law indicates that tax revenues are given to provincial governments without return. However, tax revenue redistribution is the key to achieving a so-called “double dividend”; that is, an environmental tax could benefit both the environment and economic efficiency. Based on our previous analysis of the effectiveness of the current EPT, we further explore whether the double dividend could be achieved under different tax reforms based on the multiregion and multisectoral computable general equilibrium model. We find that recycling the EPT revenue to reduce household income tax (EPT_Int) is an efficient way to achieve the double dividend, and there is no double dividend if the EPT revenue is compensated by reducing enterprise income tax (EPT_Ent) or by investing in solar power (EPT_Sol). Combining EPT_Int and EPT_Sol could be a better approach if more air pollution emissions reductions are required to achieve the national reduction targets. At the provincial level, recycling the EPT revenues to reduce household income tax could offset the negative effect of environmental tax on the economy and achieve the double dividend in all provinces, especially the provinces with higher emission intensity, such as Shanxi, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, and Guizhou Provinces. This result shows that provinces with high emission intensity may further reduce air pollutant emissions during the post-EPT era. ©2020 The Authors.","air pollution; China's environmental protection tax; computable general equilibrium model; double dividend; environmental tax reform; household welfare","atmospheric pollution; emission control; environmental economics; environmental issue; environmental protection; environmental tax; tax reform; China; Guizhou; Hebei; Nei Monggol; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083774268

Increasing effective non-state and sub-national contributions could both support NDCs’ implementation and spur ambitious updates to these national climate action plans. The impact of NSAs depends partly on whether and how national climate strategies recognize them. Yet, systematic knowledge about the extent to which national governments envisage a role for non-state and sub-national climate action is scarce. How do governments refer to NSAs in their NDCs; and what capacities, functions, and in which sectors do they envisage non-state contributions? We apply structural topic modelling (STM), an efficient quantitative text analysis technique seldom used in global climate governance research, to 147 NDCs to explore whether and how national governments incorporate non-state and subnational contributions into their international climate commitments. Using this method, we identify key topics for non-state and subnational engagement in NDCs, including vulnerability and adaptation, monitoring, general and sector-specific collaboration, and policy support. We find that developing countries overwhelmingly reference NSAs more frequently than developed countries. We also find predominantly negative trade-offs in how countries link to NSAs, suggesting countries tend to mention NSAs’ contributions in specific roles rather than across multiple sectors. Our findings suggest there is scope for countries to broaden their linkage to NSAs in their updated NDCs to further catalyze engagement. Key policy insights Linkages to NSA initiatives (including cities, regions, businesses or civil society) in NDCs under the Paris Agreement are mostly made by developing countries. Developing countries describe NSAs primarily in the context of vulnerability and adaptation policy implementation, while developed countries mainly describe these actors’ role as collaborators across a range of functions. Closer coordination between NSAs and national governments, to fully leverage NSA contributions to NDCs, can be achieved by explicitly outlining NSAs’ contributions in future updates of NDCs. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"action plan; developing world; emission control; environmental policy; national strategy; policy implementation; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068191068

Our examination focuses on heavy rainfall events and Midwestern corn farmers' nitrogen fertilizer management. Due to climate change, the frequency and intensity of heavy rain events is increasing across the Midwest. These events increase nitrogen loss to the environment and introduces economic risks to farmers. Drawing from a theoretical framework that merges O'Connor's second contradiction of capitalism and Schnaiberg's treadmill of production, we argue farmers' responses to these events reflect the second contradiction, increasing contributions to climate change, and are shaped by treadmill-like political-economic pressures. We examine this using a qualitative sample of 154 farmers across Indiana, Iowa, and Michigan. Given profit imperatives, adapting farmers in our sample primarily used increased nitrogen application rates to reduce their vulnerability to heavy rains. As nitrogen rate is directly associated with nitrous oxide emissions, this adaptive strategy is effective but increases agricultural contributions to climate change. This preliminarily suggests that the political-economic structure encourages farmers to respond to climate change in ways that accelerate the environmental contradictions of industrial agriculture. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptation; agriculture; climate change; maladaptation; nitrogen; political economy","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; fertilizer; nitrogen; political economy; Indiana; Iowa; Michigan; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075334514

Decarbonisation technologies pathways were investigated which may aid in meeting national decarbonisation targets, and their potential role at local administrative area scale evaluated. A finding arising from application of this method was that a small number of larger industrial and commercial buildings, representing only 4% of the sectors buildings, were found to account for 38% of its decarbonisation potential. Future carbon emission scenarios identified that electricity demand may be expected to increase for the industrial and commercial sector up to 2030, and that the technological potential for current photovoltaics systems have the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 4% more than currently planned Irish grid-scale decarbonisation trajectories. The method may be adopted at European scale, using local data on climate and building attributes, and is applicable at national, regional and local scales.

This study aimed to explore the potential of airborne hyperspectral image to estimate the SOC of bare topsoil at an agricultural site located in the southeast part of Iowa State, United States. To magnify the subtle spectral signals concerning SOC, and accelerate calibration and improve predictive ability, we developed a framework to combine two advanced spectral algorithms, namely, fractional-order derivative (FOD) and optimal band combination algorithm for SOC predicting. Our case was based on 49 soil samples and a scattered airborne hyperspectral image. Random forest (RF) was utilized to establish SOC estimation models by incorporating the optimal spectral indices processed by different FOD transformations on the basis of the optimal band combination algorithm. Results indicated that when the fractional order increased, overlapping peaks and baseline drifts were gradually removed. However, the magnitude of spectral strength decreased concurrently. More detailed and abundant spectral variability was captured by FOD as compared with those by original reflectance and first and second derivatives. The estimation accuracies developed from the optimal band combination algorithm (cross-validation R2, 0.36–0.66) were generally better than those from full-spectrum data (cross-validation R2, 0.32–0.54). The RF model based on the combination of 0.75-order reflectance and optimal band combination algorithm obtained the highest estimation accuracy for SOC with cross-validation R2 of 0.66.

Lake-sediment oxygen and carbon isotopes are sensitive to changes in the atmosphere, the lake catchment and the lake itself, and thus are valuable proxies for long-term environmental change. Here we present Younger Dryas and Holocene stable-isotope records from endogenic and biogenic carbonates from An Loch Mór, a karstic lake on Inis Oírr, Aran Islands, western Ireland. The bulk carbonate and ostracod-derived stable-isotope records are a complex response to regional climatic and local factors. Low oxygen-isotope and high carbon-isotope values in the Younger Dryas most likely reflect low air temperatures and dominance of bedrock-derived carbon from the poorly vegetated catchment, but input of detrital carbonate cannot be ruled out. Holocene variations in oxygen-isotope values are likely a response mainly to changes in the isotopic composition of rainfall, evaporative enrichment of lake water and, during the past millennium, incursion of seawater as a result of regional sea-level rise. A reduction in carbon-isotope values at the Younger Dryas/Early Holocene transition reflects increased input of soil-derived carbon to the lake, modified by changes in aquatic productivity. During the past millennium a shift to less negative values is attributed mainly to increasing saline influence. Broad similarities with stable-isotope records from other sites in western Ireland suggest regional climatic controls dominated by North Atlantic atmospheric circulation patterns, although abrupt events, that were possibly unique to An Loch Mór, point to local factors also being important. © 2019 Collegium Boreas.

However, stricter discharge standards, changes in wastewater compounds, high emissions of greenhouse gases, and elevated land prices have led to their replacements in many places. This review aims at delivering a comprehensive overview of the historical development and current state of WSPs, and providing further insights to deal with their limitations in the future. The 21st century is witnessing changes in the way of approaching conventional problems in pond technology, in which WSPs should no longer be considered as a low treatment technology. Advanced models and technologies have been integrated for better design, control, and management. The roles of algae, which have been crucial as solar-powered aeration, will continue being a key solution. Yet, the separation of suspended algae to avoid deterioration of the effluent remains a major challenge in WSPs while in the case of high algal rate pond, further research is needed to maximize algal growth yield, select proper strains, and optimize harvesting methods to put algal biomass production in practice. Significant gaps need to be filled in understanding mechanisms of greenhouse gas emission, climate change mitigation, pond ecosystem services, and the fate and toxicity of emerging contaminants. From these insights, adaptation strategies are developed to deal with new opportunities and future challenges. © 2020","Climate change; Emerging contaminant; Greenhouse gas; High algal rate pond; Pond modeling; Pond upgrade; Waste stabilization pond","Algae; Costs; Deterioration; Ecosystems; Effluents; Greenhouse gases; Lakes; Population statistics; Solar energy; Stabilization; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Adaptation strategies; Climate change mitigation; Emerging contaminant; Historical development; Municipal wastewater treatment; Removal efficiencies; Treatment technologies; Waste stabilization ponds; Climate change; chemical pollutant; climate change; detection method; future prospect; greenhouse gas; modeling; pond; toxicity; wastewater; wastewater treatment; algae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081699270

As electrification of heating through heat pumps becomes more common, the effects on the grid need to be quantified. Increased fluctuation and peak power demand could increase the need for fossil-based peaking power plants or call for new investments to the distribution infrastructure. The novelty in this study is the focus on hourly power demand instead of just annual energy consumption. Identifying the influence of building energy retrofits on the instantaneous power demand can help guide policy and investments into building retrofits and related technology. The work was done through dynamic building simulation and utilized building configurations obtained through multi-objective optimization. Deep energy retrofits decreased both the total and peak heating power consumption. However, the use of air-source heat pumps increased the peak power demand of electricity in district heated and wood heated buildings by as much as 100%. On the other hand, peak power demand in buildings with direct electric heating was reduced by 30 to 40%. On the building stock level, the demand reduction in buildings with direct electric heating could compensate for the increase in the share of buildings with ground-source heat pumps, so that the national peak electricity demand would not increase. This prevents the increase of demand for high emission peaking power plants as heat pump penetration rises. However, a use is needed for the excess solar electricity generated by the optimally retrofitted buildings, because much of the solar electricity cannot be utilized in the single-family houses during summer. © 2020 by the authors.

Mitigation requires the identification and protection of Areas of Ecological Significance (AESs), which have so far not been determined at the ocean-basin scale. Here, using assemblage-level tracking of marine predators, we identify AESs for this globally important region and assess current threats and protection levels. Integration of more than 4,000 tracks from 17 bird and mammal species reveals AESs around sub-Antarctic islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and over the Antarctic continental shelf. Fishing pressure is disproportionately concentrated inside AESs, and climate change over the next century is predicted to impose pressure on these areas, particularly around the Antarctic continent.

To reduce the worldwide CO2 emissions, there will be even more challenges in the distribution grids like currently upcoming charging stations or heat pumps. All these new electric systems in the low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) levels are characterized by an unsteady behavior. To monitor and predict the behavior of these new flexible systems, a grid state forecast is needed. This software tool calculates wind, photovoltaic, and load forecasts. These power forecasts are already in the focus of research, but there are some specific use cases, which require a more specific solution. To get a variously applicable software tool, different new functions to improve an already existing grid state forecast tool were developed and evaluated. For example, it will be proofed if a grid state forecast tool can be improved by calculating the number or the base load of the loads in grid areas by just one available measurement. Another big subject exists in the exchange of forecast information between different voltage levels. How this can be realized and how big the effect on the forecast quality is, will be analyzed. The results of these evaluations will be shown in this paper. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The emerging statistically derived PM2.5 estimations from satellite remote sensing observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) data are an effective alternative to reconstruct global, long-term, high spatiotemporal resolution PM2.5 information. However, studies on PM2.5 estimation and its application to exposure and health-related studies are limited in China due to the lack of historical in-situ measurements before 2013. In this study, we explored the long-term trends of PM2.5 exposure in central China, a hotspot that has recently been experiencing severe particulate pollution, at the local scale. We first developed a spatiotemporal model incorporating periodical characteristics within the data to estimate daily concentrations of historical PM2.5 at a fine scale of 1 km for 2003–2018. The linear effects of predictors including AOD, meteorological and land-use parameters and the non-linear interaction between AOD and meteorological parameters were considered in the modeling process. The most recently released high-resolution satellite aerosol product, Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) was used to help to represent the fine-scale particle gradients. Our daily estimates correlated well with in-situ observations (cross-validation R2 = 0.59), achieving precision comparable to previous statistical models. Through linking with gridded demographic data, the population-weighted PM2.5 average during 2003 to 2018 was found to be high (62.23 μg/m3 for the whole domain) with obvious spatial variations and seasonality. An inverse U pattern was seen in the time series, with two inflection points around 2008 and 2015. Our model provides reliable particulate information with high spatial resolution and long-term temporal coverage, which can inform local-scale PM2.5-related epidemiological studies and health-risk assessments for central China. © 2020 The Authors","Aerosol optical depth; Fine particulate matter; Long-term trend; Satellite remote sensing; Spatiotemporal modeling","Aerosols; Air pollution control; Health; Health risks; Inverse problems; Land use; Optical properties; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Satellites; Aerosol optical depths; Fine particulate matter; Long-term trend; Satellite remote sensing; Spatio-temporal models; Particles (particulate matter); aerosol; concentration (composition); health risk; particulate matter; pollution exposure; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; trend analysis; aerosol; article; China; cross validation; demography; health hazard; land use; meteorology; optical depth; particulate matter; remote sensing; risk assessment; seasonal variation; time series analysis; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; China; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079003315

This study identifies combinations of social subsystem indices affected by temperature changes using the conceptual framework of food security, a priori knowledge and logical reasoning to statistically analyse three 10-year data series (grain harvest grades, famine indices and economic levels) from the Western Han Dynasty to the Five Dynasties period of ancient China (210 bc to 960 ad). The results are as follows. For 94 of the 118 decades in the study period, social development was relatively directly related to temperature effects. On a decadal scale, against a cold background, grain production was closely related to temperature conditions in 40.7% of all decades. Economic prosperity and depressions in 5.1 and 21.2% of these decades, respectively, were directly related to temperature effects. Against a warm background, grain production was closely related to temperature conditions in 39% of all decades. Economic prosperity and depressions in 22 and 8.5% of these decades, respectively, were directly related to the temperature effects. The century and decadal-scale characteristics were the same. Specifically, when mostly negative combinations of natural–socioeconomic factors dominated, the proportion of decades was slightly higher in cold than in warm periods. This case study enables a scientific understanding of the effect of changes in mean climate values/trends on social development and further demonstrates the different effects of the climate change process and mechanism. Climate cooling and warming may bring more positive than negative impacts in some regions and more negative than positive impacts in others. Complex feedback may amplify or reduce the impact of climate cooling and warming. Climate that evolves unfavourably has an impact more strongly correlated with the socioeconomic system's vulnerability and adaptability. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","ancient China; food security framework; historical climate change; impact of climate change; Western Han–Five Dynasties","climate effect; climate variation; economic development; economic history; food security; paleoenvironment; socioeconomic conditions; temperature effect; vulnerability; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078760428

The ecosystem services and biodiversity that forests provide will be influenced by the behaviors of numerous individual private landowners as they alter their use of forests in response to climate change and any future carbon pricing policies that emerge. We evaluated the impact of forest landowners' likely adaptation behaviors on potential habitat for 35 terrestrial, forest-dependent vertebrates across three U.S. Pacific states. In particular, we couple a previously estimated empirical-economic model of forest management with spatially explicit species' range and habitat associations to quantify the effects of adaptation to climate change and carbon pricing on potential habitat for our focal species (amphibians, birds and mammals) drawn from state agency lists of species of conservation concern. We show that both climate change and carbon pricing policies would likely encourage adaptation away from currently prevalent coniferous forest types, such as Douglas-fir, largely through harvest and planting decisions. This would reduce potential habitat for a majority of the focal species we studied across all three vertebrate taxa. The total anticipated habitat loss for amphibians, birds and mammals considered species of state concern would exceed total habitat gained, and the net loss in habitat per decade would accelerate over time. Carbon payments to forest landowners likely would lead to unintended localized habitat losses especially in Douglas-fir dominant forest types, and encourage more hardwoods on private forest lands. Our study highlights potential tradeoffs that could arise from pricing one ecosystem service (e.g., carbon) while leaving others (e.g., wildlife habitat) unpriced. Our study demonstrates the importance of anticipating potential changes in ecosystem services and biodiversity resulting from forest landowners' climate adaptation behavior and accounting for a broader set of environmental benefits and costs when designing policies to address climate change. © 2020 This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Much of this organic waste will likely be composted and applied to farms. However, compost is expensive and energy intensive to transport, which limits the distance that compost can be shipped. Though the diversion of organic waste from landfills in California has the potential to significantly reduce methane emissions, it is unclear if enough farmland exists in close proximity to each city for the distribution of compost. To address this knowledge gap, we develop the Compost Allocation Network (CAN), a geospatial model that simulates the production and transport of waste for all California cities and farms across a range of scenarios for per capita waste production, compost application rate, and composting conversion rate. We applied this model to answer two questions: How much farmland can be applied with municipal compost and what percentage of the diverted organic waste can be used to supplement local farmland. The results suggest that a composting system that recycles nutrients between cities and local farms has the potential to play a major role in helping California meet SB 1383 while reducing state emissions by-6.3 ± 10.1 MMT CO2e annually.

However, the abundance, diversity and succession of denitrifying bacteria and their association with farming systems are largely unknown. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were: (1) to unravel the influence of long-term organic farming on diversity of nirK-, nirS- and nosZ-type denitrifying microorganisms; and (2) to analyze the association of diversity and abundance of these denitrifying microorganism with the emission of N2O from soil. The abundance and diversity of denitrifying bacteria with nirK, nirS and nosZ were compared among organic (ORG), integrated (INT), and conventional (CON) vegetable greenhouses located in northern China over four growing seasons using quantitative PCR and high-throughput DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified products. As compared to CON, the abundance of nosZ gene was significantly higher in the ORG, in which the N2O emission was 35% lower. In general, both abundance and diversity of nitrite reducing populations (nirK- and nirS-type) was influenced by growing seasons rather than farming systems. Additionally, dominant denitrifying populations displayed irregular, periodical, or persistent succession patterns.

The quality of life is greatly affected due to exposure to exhaust flume. In this study, a typical single-burner conventional stove was used to model a rural kitchen. The overall dimension of the model kitchen is 3.50 m × 2.20 m × 1.85 m. A three-dimensional CFD code was adopted to perform steady-state simulations with appropriate boundary conditions. Numerical accuracy was tested for optimum grid as well. In this study, varying intensity of emissions of CO, CO2, and particulate matter (PM) from different kinds of biofuel burning have been investigated. Dispersions of these pollutants in the kitchen space have been investigated for with and without natural ventilation. The natural ventilation in turn has been investigated with and without hood systems. It has been observed that CO (95 PPM), CO2 (2200 PPM), and PM (750 µg/m3) concentration exceed by significant amount than the safe threshold (Wisconsin Department of Health Services, USA, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USA) (CO ≤ 10 PPM, CO2 ≤ 1000 PPM, and PM ≤ 150 µg/m3) for no ventilation case. Even the natural ventilation condition through roof top chimney fails to keep the concentration below the safe limit. Only natural ventilation can reduce CO, CO2, and PM concentrations by 18%, 10%, and 65%, respectively. However, a significant improvement was observed under natural ventilation for the kitchen with the addition of a suction hood along with the roof top chimney. In this exhaust system, the reduction of CO, CO2, and PM10 are seen to be 68%, 55%, and 80%, respectively. Consequently, to overcome the long-term effect of exposure to all harmfull hazardous emissions, it is recommended for any rural kitchen to utilize efficient forced ventilation exhaust system if affordable or an advanced natural ventilation system as proposed in this study utilizing suction hood.

Value-based decision models contend that prosocial tendencies and social context shape people's preferences for cooperative or selfish behavior. Using functional neuroimaging and computational modeling, we tested these predictions by comparing activity in brain regions previously linked to valuation and executive function during decision-making-the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), respectively. Participants played Public Goods Games with students from fictitious universities, where social norms were selfish or cooperative. Prosocial participants showed greater vmPFC activity when cooperating and dlPFC-vmPFC connectivity when acting selfishly, whereas selfish participants displayed the opposite pattern. Norm-sensitive participants showed greater dlPFC-vmPFC connectivity when defying group norms. Modeling expectations of cooperation was associated with activity near the right temporoparietal junction. Consistent with value-based models, this suggests that prosocial tendencies and contextual norms flexibly determine whether people prefer cooperation or defection. © 2020 The Author(s).","Cooperation; FMRI; Norms; Preferences; Prosocial; Social neuroscience","adult; article; brain region; computer model; controlled study; decision making; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; executive function; expectation; female; functional neuroimaging; human; human experiment; intuition; male; neuroscience; prediction; social norm; temporoparietal junction; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; group process; intuition; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; prefrontal cortex; social norm; young adult; Adult; Decision Making; Executive Function; Female; Group Processes; Humans; Intuition; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Prefrontal Cortex; Social Norms; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096638298

Thus, it is vital to understand the process of farmers’ adaptation decisions when informing policy interventions. It is hypothesized that farmers’ decisions to take actions against climate change are related to risk experience as well as a range of socio-economic variables. Although evidence indicates that socio-economic variables are relevant, the empirical evidence on the role of risk experience on adaptation decisions is limited. The present study assesses whether perceived risk experience in terms of agricultural production shocks and yield reduction influence farmers’ decisions to adapt. Data collected from smallholder farmers in Ethiopia is used for this purpose. The study applies a multivariate endogenous probit model and controls for potential endogeneity of perceived risk experiences to adaptation decision. The results indicate that farmers who perceive having experienced production shocks are more likely to decide to adapt. However, experiencing simply yield reduction is not associated with adaptation decision. Other socio-economic, institutional, and agro-ecological variables are also found to be associated with adaptation decisions. It is concluded that the role of risk experience on farmers’ decision to adapt is a function of the severity of the experienced risk. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; production shock; Risk experience; yield reduction","agricultural production; agroecology; agrometeorology; climate change; decision making; farmers attitude; local adaptation; risk assessment; smallholder; socioeconomic indicator; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068206536

It is difficult to use formulas for physically worn-out systems description, mainly because thermotechnical characteristics of the insulating components have significant deviations from the standard values. Boiler's equipment physical depreciation increases greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Therefore, dealing with modernization funding feasibility of the heat energy sources, and also for periodic adjustment works that help to reduce harmful substance emissions into the atmosphere, requires the use of a fairly complete mathematical model of a boiler and a heat network. However, the lack of data makes it very difficult to formulate a reliable model. Status analysis of every element in the system is a labor-intensive and expensive task. Another extremely labor-intensive issue is a determination of the forecasted thermal energy demand of the municipal consumers and sector of housing and public utilities. Physically worn-out buildings have low thermal resistance, which increases heat demand. Calculation of the necessary amount of heat generation by the worn-out boilers for the city districts with worn-out buildings is difficult due to lack of a wide range of data about the boiler's condition, network condition, and heated buildings condition.

In recent years, Turkey has imported around at the rate of three-quarters of its total energy demand. Upon the past 10-years running, Turkey paid nearly half a trillion dollars for its total energy bill. The big share of energy consumption has emerged from buildings. Therefore, energy savings have great importance, particularly in the buildings. A refrigerator is responsible for the most dominant electrical energy consumption rate with 32% in a house. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel household refrigerator design for reducing energy consumption. In the proposed design, the necessary air for the cooling process will be provided from outdoor ambient in appropriate weather condition. The compressor work will, thus, be decreased via this way, and contribute to a reduction in energy consumption. The results indicated that this system in 63 provinces can be effectively used between 1 and 4 months and help to reduce 36 million $ in Turkish electric energy bill with the use of only 1 year period. Additionally, a reduction of approximately 850,000 tons of CO2 annually in Turkey can be achieved by applying the proposed design in this study. Hereby, Turkey can contribute not only to be sustained economic growth but also to reduce harmful gas emissions arising from electricity generation methods in the country. © 2019 Karabuk University","Carbon emission; Electrical energy consumption; Energy saving; Household refrigerator; Turkey's energy balance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067367215

Although the regulations built around these standardized cycles have strongly contributed to improved fuel efficiency, they are unable to cover the envelope of operating and environmental conditions the vehicle will be subject to when driving in the ""real-world"". This discrepancy becomes even more dramatic with the introduction of Connectivity and Automation, which allows for information on future route and traffic conditions to be available to the vehicle and powertrain control system. Furthermore, the huge variability of external conditions, such as vehicle load or driver behavior, can significantly affect the fuel economy on a given route. Such variability poses significant challenges when attempting to compare the performance and fuel economy of different powertrain technologies, vehicle dynamics and powertrain control methods. This paper describes a methodology to benchmark the fuel consumption reduction potential of a Level 1 Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) with advanced cylinder deactivation and 48V mild hybridization, in the presence of variability induced by route characteristics, traffic and driver behavior. An Intelligent Driving system utilizes advanced route information available from the navigation system and GPS, as well as a V2X communication module to determine the optimal vehicle velocity and battery state of charge profiles that aim at minimizing fuel consumption along a driver-selected route without sacrificing travel time. Since the presence of traffic and the behavior of different drivers strongly affects the fuel consumption and vehicle travel time, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to determine the statistical distribution of the results when introducing variability in the inputs. Fuel efficiency benefits are dependent on the route characteristics, traffic conditions and driver behavior. For the route evaluated in this paper, numerical results show as much as 15% to 19% reduction in fuel consumption, compared to a mild hybrid baseline vehicle without cylinder deactivation and CAV features. © 2020 SAE International.

The purpose of this study is to predict the NH3 emissions and analyze the mitigation potential up to year 2040 by scenario analysis based on the established new NH3 emission inventory from anthropogenic sources for the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region. The results showed that the total NH3 emission in the BTH region was estimated at 966.14 Gg in 2016. Under the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario, the total NH3 emissions in 2030 and 2040 would increase by 13% and 26% compared with 2016 levels, with average annual growth rates of 0.9% and 1.0%, respectively. Livestock will continue to dominate NH3 emissions in the future, with the proportions of total emissions increasing from 57% in 2016 to 64% in 2030 and 68% in 2040. The share of the second-largest NH3 emission source, synthetic fertilizer application, will decrease from 36% in 2016 to 31% in 2030 and 27% in 2040. Among five other sources, the largest change occurred in waste disposal, increasing notably by 3.31 times from 2016 to 2040 owing to rapid urbanization. Under the Combined Options (CO) scenario, the total NH3 emissions could be reduced by as much as 34% by 2030 and 50% by 2040 compared with the BAU scenario, which is attributed to livestock (24% in 2030, 37% in 2040) and synthetic fertilizer application (10% in 2030, 13% in 2040), respectively.

However, the Mongolian economy dominated by the carbon-intensive industries (such as mining and construction) has been experiencing rapid growth since 2 decades ago, consequently influencing its GHG emissions, while the impact of Mongolia's economic growth on GHG emissions and their socioeconomic driving factors remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study applied a multiregional input–output model to calculate the embodied GHG emissions and a structural decomposition analysis was used to identify the key driving factors of the embodied GHG emissions. Results show that the GHG emissions increased from 8679 Gg CO2e to 17,165 Gg CO2e, with an annual growth rate of 4.65% during 2000–2015. Household consumption and gross fixed capital formation are identified as the key driving factors for the increase in embodied GHG emissions, while technical efficiency is the main factor contributed to the emission decline in Mongolia. China, Russia, and South Korea were the top three regions to outsource their carbon emissions to Mongolia by international trade. Regional collaborative carbon emission mitigation strategies from the system embodiment perspective are suggested. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Driving factors; Embodied greenhouse gas emissions; Mongolia; Multiregional input–output analysis","Carbon; Economic analysis; Factor analysis; Gas emissions; International trade; Annual growth rate; Driving factors; Household Consumption; Mongolia; Output analysis; Regional collaborative; Structural decomposition analysis; Technical efficiency; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; socioeconomic conditions; algorithm; Article; calculation; carbon footprint; controlled study; decomposition; economic development; gross national product; growth rate; household; household consumption; Mongolia; population size; priority journal; urban area; China; Mongolia; Russian Federation; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078496951

Coal permeability is the key factor that affects the CBM drainage efficiency. To understand the coal permeability evolution characteristics, coal specimens reconstituted by coal powder with different particle sizes were prepared and their permeability under loading conditions was investigated. The results indicate that the coal permeability evolution laws measured by different gases are completely different under constant hydrostatic pressure conditions due to the influence of effective stress and the coal matrix sorption-induced deformation. Under constant effective stress conditions, the helium permeability of coals is almost unchanged if the effects of the Biot's coefficient of coals are ignored, but the methane permeability of coals decreases with increasing gas pressure. In the complete stress–strain process, the variation of coal permeability as the axial strain increases at different stages is almost completely different and the coal permeability in the residual plastic flow stage increases by 2.4–71 times, 1.5–39 times, and 2.8–116 times that of the initial state under the different boundary conditions. Furthermore, it is also found that the coal permeability evolution laws are determined by the effective stress, the sorption-induced deformation of coal matrices, and the malconformation of gas adsorption in coals.

A self-embedded templating strategy for preparing the TMO@carbon quasiaerogels (TMO@C-QAs) is proposed. By mimicking an aerogel structure at a microscale, the TMO@C-QA successfully assembles size-controllable TMO nanoparticles into 3D interconnected structure with surface-enriched carbon species. The morphological evolutions of intermediates verify that the self-embedded Ostwald ripening templating approach is responsible for the dual-channel TMO@C-QA formation. The general self-embedded templating strategy is easily extended to prepare various TMO@C-QAs, including the Co3O4@C-QA, Mn3O4@C-QA, Fe2O3@C-QA, and NiO@C-QA. Benefiting from the unparalleled 3D interconnected network of aerogels, the Co3O4@C-QA displays superior bifunctional catalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as high specific capacity and excellent long-term stability for lithium-ion battery (LIB) anode. A proof-of-concept battery-powered electrolyzer with Co3O4@C-QA cathode and anode powered by a full LIB with Co3O4@C-QA anode is presented.

We present a simple stable carbon isotope (δ13C) approach for distinguishing between sockeye (anadromous ocean migrants) and kokanee (potamodromous freshwater residents), two migratory ecotypes of Oncorhynchus nerka (Salmonidae) that is applicable throughout most of their range across coastal regions of the North Pacific Ocean. Analyses of kokanee (n = 239) and sockeye (n = 417) from 87 sites spanning the North Pacific (Russia to California) show that anadromous and potamodromous ecotypes are broadly distinguishable on the basis of the δ13C values of their scale and bone collagen. We present three case studies demonstrating how this approach can address questions in archaeology, archival, and conservation research. Relative to conventional methods for determining migratory status, which typically apply chemical analyses to otoliths or involve genetic analyses of tissues, the δ13C approach outlined here has the benefit of being non-lethal (when applied to scales), cost-effective, widely available commercially, and should be much more broadly accessible for addressing archaeological questions since the recovery of otoliths at archaeological sites is rare.

It not only causes serious losses to our economy, but also brings great hidden dangers to the physical and mental health of urban residents. Therefore, it is urgent to prevent and control air pollution. Air quality prediction and forecasting must be carried out to prevent air pollution. Timely and accurate air quality prediction can not only help urban managers to make scientific and effective preventive measures, but also provide more healthy and safe travel strategies for urban residents. China’s air monitoring system is gradually improving, its scale is expanding, and a large amount of air quality data is accumulating. With the rapid expansion of data scale, the traditional method of air quality prediction technology has been unable to deal with these massive data. In this paper, 365 sets of air pollutant data from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 in Shen Zhen were used as experimental objects. The improved SAPSO algorithm and PSO algorithm were used to optimize the parameters of SVM model and construct the air quality evaluation model. By analyzing the classification results of air quality grade, selecting relevant data and using partial least squares, the correlation coefficient matrix is established for the classification results, and the pollutant factors affecting air quality in Shenzhen are obtained. The results are ideal, which provides a scientific theoretical basis for the prevention and control of air pollution and urban management planning. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Classification and prediction; Machine learning; Neural network; Support vector machine","Air quality; Forecasting; Learning systems; Least squares approximations; Neural networks; Quality control; Support vector machines; Air quality prediction; Classification results; Correlation coefficient; Environmental pollution problem; Neural network algorithm; Partial least square (PLS); Prevention and controls; Quality evaluation models; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074493846

Behavioural changes related to climate change also impact ‘in-use’ emissions, and potentially, emissions both ‘upstream’ (including from imported goods) and ‘downstream’ (eg disposal). Consumption-oriented policies may provide avenues to additional and cost-effective emission reductions, but are less prevalent, in part because of political sensitivities around government efforts to shape individual-level mitigation behaviour. In this paper, we explore policy instruments for encouraging low carbon behaviour in the EU context. Drawing on a literature survey and interviews, as part of the EU Carbon-CAP project, we develop a list of 33 potential instruments, present a systematic methodology for assessing their potential impact and feasibility, and apply this to rank instruments of most interest. Most instruments involve a clear trade-off between their potential impact and feasibility; about half feature in the top three scoring categories, many being voluntary approaches, which may be easier to implement, but with limited or highly uncertain impact. However, we identify a handful of top-scoring instruments that deserve far more policy attention. The complexity of consumer and corporate motivations and behaviours suggests that instruments should be trialled and monitored (e.g. in regions / individual States) before widespread introduction. Most would also be most effective when nested within wider policy packages, to address the varied behavioural motivations and stages of supply chains. Key policy insights Influencing consumer behaviour has been little used in climate policy and is politically sensitive and complex, but can address emissions that have largely escaped influence to date. A few instruments stand out as particularly promising, including: technology lists; supply chain procurement by leading retail companies; a carbon-intensive materials consumption charge; and key infrastructure improvements. A common trade-off between potential impact and likely feasibility points to the importance of government-business collaboration to secure support and impact.

However, it is uninformative on the prevalence of perspectives in the general population. The Norwegian government considers planting spruce climate forests on abandoned pastures, the habitat for many red listed species. We identify three prevailing stakeholder perspectives in the climate forest debate using the Q method; one pro climate forest and two against with differing motivations. Using the so-called scale creation method (Danielson, 2009) and a national survey, we measure the support of the general population for these perspectives and elicit their concern for ecosystem services. About half of the sample is pro climate forest. Opposition is greater in regions where spruce is uncommon and abandoned pastures are common. The impact of climate forests on biodiversity and landscapes is a concern. Conflicts would be dampened if climate forest policy took impacts on landscape aesthetics and biodiversity better into account. Our proposed generalised Q method combines two strengths: the depth of the Q method with the breadth of the general population survey. The method demonstrates a way forward in ecological economics to better capture representative values and perspectives in ecosystem service management and help design climate and environmental policies with greater acceptance. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change; Conservation; Ecosystem services; Forest; Q Method; Values","biodiversity; climate change; conservation status; ecological economics; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; esthetics; forest ecosystem; forestry policy; landscape ecology; numerical method; resource use; Norway; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078061631

Although some studies have addressed the short and long-run impacts of climate change on agriculture, few of them specifically focused on the analysis of its thermal component. Climatic regions with an extreme thermal range are a special case, as seasonal contrasts complicate the picture. Based on the above, the purpose of the paper is twofold. First, we review methods and indices used for the estimation of changes in the thermal component of the climate and demonstrate the usefulness of a sensitivity assessment methodology that gives some indication of the likely spatial extent of areas of high or low sensitivity to climate change and the size of the potential impact of that change, which is specifically beneficial in regions with high temperature extremes. Secondly, we constructed a composite indicator, called the Growing Degree Day Sensitivity Index (GDDSI) and defined as the percentage change in Growing Degree Day (GDD) for warming scenarios +1, +2 and +3 °C. GDDs were calculated for threshold base air temperatures of 0, 5, 10 and 15 °C, and a high-temperature limit of 30 °C. A GDD sensitivity analysis was applied to the thermally extreme climate of the Russian Far East. We analyzed the data of 50 weather stations across the study region over the period 1966-2017. The results show a strong GDDSI north-to-south gradient. In most cases, the sensitivity does not increase significantly as the warming rate increases. The higher the base threshold, the higher the sensitivity: GDDs with a threshold at 15 °C had the highest sensitivity in the far north of the study area where conditions are currently marginal for crop growth. The sensitivity analysis circumnavigates the difficulty of uncertainty in knowing what future climate to expect and informs planning decisions. The mapped results are useful for identifying areas of high sensitivity to climate change as well as the magnitude of the potential impact of that change. © 2020 by the author.","Climate and agriculture; Climate change; Growing degree days; Russian far east; Sensitivity index; Thermal indices","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Sensitivity analysis; Temperature; Uncertainty analysis; Assessment methodologies; Climate change impact; Climatic indicators; Composite indicators; Growing degree-days; Potential impacts; Sensitivity indices; Thermal component; Climate change; agriculture; air temperature; climate change; climate effect; sensitivity analysis; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085081821

The Abu Dhabi government announced in 2006 its intent to spend $22 billion to build one such city, Masdar City, as a carbon-neutral, zero-waste city that would demonstrate the state-of-the-art in sustainable city design. As initially planned, Masdar City was a bold experiment: an incubator of clean-technologies that was to be powered exclusively by renewable energy while exhibiting the highest levels of energy efficiency. Partly due to the 2008 global financial crisis and partly due to lessons learned from continued assessments of the original concept, planners at Masdar both scaled back initial ambitions for the city's carbon and waste targets and significantly altered both the city's development approach and timeline for completion. This, however, may turn out to be the best outcome for Masdar City if it is truly to become a model for “eco-cities” of the future. Masdar now seeks a more commercial model that nonetheless retains a focus on sustainable urban design. This Perspective reviews the history of Masdar City from its inception to the present day and highlights the major changes that have occurred in its city planning. In consideration of the facts presented, Masdar City may yet emerge as a true eco-city. Regardless, it certainly constitutes an omen with incredibly important empirical lessons for other cities around the world seeking to become more sustainable. © 2019 The Authors","Eco-city; Future city; Masdar; Sustainable city; Urban design; Urbanization",,Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076082518

Long-term solutions to climate change will require reduction in GHG emissions as well as the removal of large quantities of GHGs from the atmosphere. Natural climate solutions (NCS), i.e., changes in land management, ecosystem restoration, and avoided conversion of habitats, have substantial potential to meet global and national greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets and contribute to the global drawdown of GHGs. However, the relative role of NCS to contribute to GHG reduction at subnational scales is not well known. We examined the potential for 12 NCS activities on natural and working lands in Oregon, USA to reduce GHG emissions in the context of the state's climate mitigation goals. We evaluated three alternative scenarios wherein NCS implementation increased across the applicable private or public land base, depending on the activity, and estimated the annual GHG reduction in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) attributable to NCS from 2020 to 2050. We found that NCS within Oregon could contribute annual GHG emission reductions of 2.7 to 8.3 MMT CO2e by 2035 and 2.9 to 9.8 MMT CO2e by 2050. Changes in forest-based activities including deferred timber harvest, riparian reforestation, and replanting after wildfires contributed most to potential GHG reductions (76 to 94% of the overall annual reductions), followed by changes to agricultural management through no-till, cover crops, and nitrogen management (3 to 15% of overall annual reductions). GHG reduction benefits are relatively high per unit area for avoided conversion of forests (125-400 MT CO2e ha-1). However, the existing land use policy in Oregon limits the current geographic extent of active conversion of natural lands and thus, avoided conversions results in modest overall potential GHG reduction benefits (i.e., less than 5% of the overall annual reductions). Tidal wetland restoration, which has high per unit area carbon sequestration benefits (8.8 MT CO2e ha-1 yr-1), also has limited possible geographic extent resulting in low potential (&lt; 1%) of state-level GHG reduction contributions. However, co-benefits such as improved habitat and water quality delivered by restoration NCS pathways are substantial. Ultimately, reducing GHG emissions and increasing carbon sequestration to combat climate change will require actions across multiple sectors. We demonstrate that the adoption of alternative land management practices on working lands and avoided conversion and restoration of native habitats can achieve meaningful state-level GHG reductions. © 2020 Graves et al.

As a consequence, planning for climate change in urban areas does not only provide the opportunity but should necessitate considering interactions between mitigation and adaptation actions. However, existing research found that only a minority of urban areas consider both mitigation and adaptation in their climate action plans, i.e. 147 Climate Change Action Plans (CCAPs) were identified among a representative sample of 885 European cities. We investigate these 147 CCAPs to understand the degree of integration of adaptation and mitigation and draw implications for the maximization of synergies and co-benefits of such a combined approach. Using the developed scoring framework to evaluate the level of integration of CCAPs, the research finds that most of the plans reveal a ‘moderate’ level of integration. Moderate integration characterizes a plan that identifies sources of emissions and vulnerabilities to climate change, as well as some qualitative consideration of the synergies, but one that lacks a systematic consideration of potential integration opportunities. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that one of the main gaps of the evaluation and implementation of more integrated climate change actions in cities is the insufficient quantitative evaluation of the costs and funding schemes for adaptation and mitigation action implementation. © 2019","Co-benefits; European cities; Evaluation; Interrelationships; Planning; Scoring; Synergies; Urban","Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Planning; Urban planning; Co benefits; European cities; Evaluation; Interrelationships; Scoring; Synergies; Urban; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077310572

The current topic of argument among the sustainability research community is on the wise selection of processes that will maximize yield and minimize emissions. The purpose of this paper is to outline different parameters and processes that impact the performance of biogas production plants through an extensive literature review. These include: comparison of biogas plant efficiency based on the use of a diverse range of feedstock; comparison of environmental impacts and its reasons during biogas production based on different feedstock and the processes followed in the management of digestate; analysis of the root cause of inefficiencies in the process of biogas production; factors affecting the energy efficiency of biogas plants based on the processes followed; and the best practices and the future research directions based on the existing life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a systematic literature review of research articles pertaining to LCA to understand in depth the current research and gaps, and to suggest future research directions. Findings: Findings include the impact of the type of feedstock used on the efficiency of the biogas plants and the level of environmental emissions. Based on the analysis of literature pertaining to LCA, diverse factors causing emissions from biogas plants are enlisted. Similarly, the root causes of inefficiencies of biogas plants were also analyzed, which will further help researchers/professionals resolve such issues. Findings also include the limitations of existing research body and factors affecting the energy efficiency of biogas plants. Research limitations/implications: This review is focused on articles published from 2006 to 2019 and is limited to the performance of biogas plants using LCA methodology. Originality/value: Literature review showed that a majority of articles focused mainly on the efficiency of biogas plants. The novel and the original aspect of this review paper is that the authors, alongside efficiency, have considered other critical parameters such as environmental emission, energy usage, processes followed during anaerobic digestion and the impact of co-digestion of feed as well. The authors also provide solid scientific reasoning to the emission and inefficiencies of the biogas plants, which were rarely analyzed in the past. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas plant; Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment; Organic feedstock","anaerobic digestion; biogas; emission; energy efficiency; environmental impact; life cycle analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076182885

However, a literature review shows that: (i) academic papers on the adoption of additive manufacturing have focused mainly on large companies; (ii) the methods required by SMEs to adopt new technologies differ from those employed by large companies; and (iii) recent studies suggest that a suitable way to help small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to adopt new additive manufacturing technologies from the academic world is by presenting case studies in which SMEs are involved. Given the increasing number of global SMEs (i.e., SMEs that manufacture locally and sell globally), we claim that these companies need to be assisted in adopting spare-parts additive manufacturing for the sake of resource and environmental sustainability. To bridge this gap, the purpose of this article is to present a case study approach that shows how a digital supply chain for spare parts has the potential to bring about changes in business models with significant benefits for both global SMEs (more effective logistic management), customers (response time), and the environment (reduced energy, emissions, raw materials, and waste). © 2020 by the authors.","Additive manufacturing; Business model; Digital supply chain; On-demand production; Resource efficiency; Small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); Spare parts","additive; business; environmental economics; global perspective; literature review; logistics; manufacturing; small and medium-sized enterprise; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084539071

In particular, the electricity sector’s emissions have risen by 2.4 times since 2000 and may increase by another 2.6 times by 2040, motivated by the burgeoning regional energy demand. If realised, this growth in CO2 emissions could stall global climate mitigation and sustainability efforts. The electricity sector, however, has a large potential for decarbonization. To reveal the driving factors of historical trends, spatial-temporal index decomposition analyses (ST-IDA) based on the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) is applied to analyse ASEAN’s aggregate carbon intensity (ACI) of electricity from 2000 to 2015. The technique combines temporal and spatial data to reveal the factors influencing regional trends and allow for comparisons across countries. The results show that in the face of rapidly rising electricity demands, many ASEAN countries have failed to maintain consistent improvements in the ACI through the adoption of renewable energy or improvement in generation mix. While some countries have switched to cleaner forms of generation such as natural gas, varying energy resource endowments, national circumstances and energy demand trends are challenges to the adoption of renewable energy. Pressures from energy demand and technological challenges also prevent some countries from sustaining overall improvements in generation efficiencies of fossil fuel plants. Improving energy planning, demand management and greater regional cooperation are key to the decarbonisation of the electricity system. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

They provide food and support livelihoods for millions of people in addition to delivering important ecosystems services. However, rangelands are at threat from climate change, although the extent and magnitude of the potential impacts are poorly understood. Any declines in vegetation biomass and fluctuations in grazing availability would be of concern for food production and ecosystem integrity and functionality. In this study, we use a global rangeland model in combination with livestock and socio-economic datasets to identify where and to what extent rangeland systems may be at climatic risk. Overall, mean herbaceous biomass is projected to decrease across global rangelands between 2000 and 2050 under RCP 8.5 (-4.7%), while inter-(year-to-year) and intra-(month-to-month) annual variabilities are projected to increase (+21.3% and +8.2%, respectively). These averaged global estimates mask large spatial heterogeneities, with 74% of global rangeland area projected to experience a decline in mean biomass, 64% an increase in inter-annual variability and 54% an increase in intra-annual variability. Half of global rangeland areas are projected to experience simultaneously a decrease in mean biomass and an increase in inter-annual variability-vegetation trends both potentially harmful for livestock production. These regions include notably the Sahel, Australia, Mongolia, China, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and support 376 million people and 174 million ruminant Tropical Livestock Units. Additionally, the rangeland communities currently the most vulnerable (here, with the lowest livestock productivities and economic development levels and with the highest projected increases in human population densities) are projected to also experience the most damaging vegetation trends for livestock production. Although the capacity of rangeland systems to adapt is highly complex, analyses such as these generate some of the information required to inform options to facilitate pastoral system mitigation and adaptation strategies under climate change. © 2020 The Author(s).

Water fluxes and stores regulate the Earth's climate and are essential for thriving aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as water, food, and energy security. But the water cycle is also being modified by humans at an unprecedented scale and rate. A holistic understanding of freshwater's role for Earth system resilience and the detection and monitoring of anthropogenic water cycle modifications across scales is urgent, yet existing methods and frameworks are not well suited for this. In this paper we highlight four core Earth system functions of water (hydroclimatic regulation, hydroecological regulation, storage, and transport) and key related processes. Building on systems and resilience theory, we review the evidence of regional-scale regime shifts and disruptions of the Earth system functions of water. We then propose a framework for detecting, monitoring, and establishing safe limits to water cycle modifications and identify four possible spatially explicit methods for their quantification. In sum, this paper presents an ambitious scientific and policy grand challenge that could substantially improve our understanding of the role of water in the Earth system and cross-scale management of water cycle modifications that would be a complementary approach to existing water management tools. ©2020.

The calculations were performed using 30-minute generation and consumption data from a large scale smart meter project in Cyprus. To investigate the effects of recent advances in local legislation, an analysis for higher PV capacities (5 kWp and 10 kWp) was also performed. The PV generation profiles for 5 kWp and 10 kWp PVs were obtained by scaling the 3 kWp PV generation profiles. The results showed that the self-consumption of the analyzed households varied seasonally, as it was related to their heating and cooling demand. More interestingly, the ratio between the households' annual electricity generation and demand, formally defined here as generation-to-demand ratio (GTDR), was found to be related to the value ranges of the studied load matching indicators. Hence, on average, households with 3 kWp PV generators annually self-consumed 48.17% and exported 2,415.10 kWh of their PV generation. On the other hand, households with larger PV generators were characterized by a higher GTDR, but lower load matching capabilities. For the cases of 5 kWp and 10 kWp PV generators, the average self-consumption fell to 34.05% and 19.31%, while the exported PV generation was equal to 5,122.47 kWh, and 12,534.90 kWh, respectively. Along with lower load matching capabilities, households that generated more than they consumed were also found to have a lower potential for CO2 emissions reduction per installed kWp within the boundaries of the building. In this context, the GTDR could be used by stakeholders to characterize buildings, infer possible value ranges of more complex indicators and make evidence based decisions on policy and legislation. © 2020 by the authors.

Increasing evidences demonstrated that NBS can reduce risks to people and property as effectively as traditional grey infrastructures, but potentially offering many additional benefits, e.g. improving the natural habitat for wildlife, enhancing water and air quality, improving socio-cultural conditions of communities. The growing attention on the NBS, triggered an increasing interest in developing integrated and multi-disciplinary frameworks for assessing NBS effectiveness accounting for the co-benefits production. Starting from the analysis of the existing frameworks, this work claims for a more direct engagement of stakeholders – i.e. co-benefits beneficiaries – in developing NBS assessment framework. This work aims at demonstrating that differences in co-benefits perception and valuation might lead to trade-offs and, thus, to potential conflicts. An innovative methodology using a quasi-dynamic Fuzzy Cognitive Map approach based on multiple-time-steps was developed in order to assess NBS effectiveness, and to detect and analyze trade-offs among stakeholders due to differences in co-benefits perception. The developed methodology was implemented in the Lower Danube case study. The trade-off analysis among stakeholders shows that they are quite low in the short term. Most of the potential conflicts can be detected in the long term, involving mainly the stakeholders that assigned a high value to the agricultural productivity variable. The results demonstrated that accounting for the different stakeholders' perception of the co-benefits is key for reducing trade-offs and enhance NBS acceptability. © 2020 The Authors","Co-benefits; Fuzzy cognitive map; Nature-based solutions; System dynamic analysis; Trade-offs analysis","Air quality; Cognitive systems; Fuzzy rules; Productivity; Risk assessment; Agricultural productivity; Climate related risks; Co benefits; Engineered structures; Fuzzy cognitive map; Innovative methodologies; Potential conflict; Trade off; Economic and social effects; climate effect; fuzzy mathematics; local participation; participatory approach; perception; risk assessment; stakeholder; trade-off; article; cognitive map; comparative effectiveness; human; perception; productivity; Danube River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078043502

Yet, some governments – including those in Australia – fail to meet agreed targets and continue to invest in the coal industry. Scientists and other scholars have expressed concern that the science is not prompting shifts in policy adequate to address current and future effects of climate change. Many have called for other tools – specifically, the arts and social sciences – to investigate and communicate about the environmental and social changes underway. In this context, this article explores the potential of interdisciplinary collaborative song-writing as research practice. Beginning on a boat on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, the research team adopted singing and song-writing as a method for coming together to reflect upon our research aims and motivations, to explore and express the delight and grief we were experiencing in this climate-changing land and seascape and potentially to reach new audiences and create different affects. Our multidisciplinary expertise offered impetus to pursue a hybrid form: an original song written, professionally recorded and vinyl pressed; scholarly notes to expand on our song lyrics; visual presentation of our music as annotated score; and written reflections on the process and its contribution to knowledge.

The effects of temperature and dust accumulation on the solar PV panels on the design and performance of the hybrid power system in a desert region is investigated. The goal of the proposed off-grid hybrid renewable energy system is to increase the penetration of renewable energy in the energy mix, reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion, and lower the cost of energy from the power systems. Simulation, modeling, optimization and dispatch control strategies were used in this study to determine the performance and the cost of the proposed hybrid renewable power system. The simulation results show that the distributed power generation using solar PV and Fuel Cell energy systems integrated with an electrolyzer for hydrogen production and using cycle charging dispatch control strategy (the fuel cell will operate to meet the AC primary load and the surplus of electrical power is used to run the electrolyzer) offers the best performance. The hybrid power system was designed to meet the energy demand of 4500 kWh/day of the residential community (150 houses). The total power production from the distributed hybrid energy system was 52% from the solar PV, and 48% from the fuel cell. From the total electricity generated from the photovoltaic hydrogen fuel cell hybrid system, 80.70% is used to meet all the AC load of the residential community with negligible unmet AC primary load (0.08%), 14.08% is the input DC power for the electrolyzer for hydrogen production, 3.30% are the losses in the DC/AC inverter, and 1.84% is the excess power (dumped energy). The proposed off-grid hybrid renewable power system has 40.2% renewable fraction, is economically viable with a levelized cost of energy of 145 $/MWh and is environmentally friendly (zero carbon dioxide emissions during the electricity generation from the solar PV and Fuel Cell hybrid power system). © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Desert region; Fuel cell; Hydrogen production; Microgrid; Optimization; Solar PV","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Electric load dispatching; Electric power generation; Electric power measurement; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Electrolytic cells; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen production; Landforms; Microgrids; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Desert region; Effects of temperature; Electricity generation; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Micro grid; Renewable power systems; Residential communities; Solar PVs; Electric power system economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048328107

This paper reviews studies using life cycle assessment (LCA) methods, specifically input-output and hybrid analysis, which used a consumption based accounting system to quantify direct (Scope 1) emissions and indirect (Scope 2 and Scope 3) emissions at the urban scale. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions for case studies are scaled toward three metrics: nominal Gross Domestic Product, population, and population density; as these factors are known to be influential in life cycle assessment results at these scales. However, this work illustrates that, for the cities and countries considered in these case studies, the similarity between cities within the same country is more pronounced than any effects of Gross Domestic Product (economy) or population/population density (city size) across cities in different countries. Accounting for greenhouse gas emissions at city scale using LCA methods presents difficulties in three LCA phases: In Phase 1, there is no agreement available on a concisely defined city boundary and the extent to which indirect emissions are included; In Phase 2, there is a lack of publicly available data from governments for a wide range of locations; In Phase 3, there are few studies among those reviewed that provided a thorough analysis of greenhouse gas emissions using life cycle impact assessment at urban scale. Because of these issues with LCA Phases 1–3, Phase 4 (interpretation of results) cannot be performed effectively to assist with emissions reduction policymaking and planning. © 2019","Carbon dioxide emissions; Consumption based; Greenhouse gas inventories; life cycle assessment; Scope 3 emissions; Urban sustainability","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Population statistics; Carbon dioxide emissions; Consumption based; Greenhouse gas inventory; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Urban sustainability; Life cycle",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078758185

An FPP located in the Netherlands has historically used perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) for fluoropolymer production and is currently using GenX (HFPO-DA; 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)propionic acid) as a replacement. This study reviewed existing data from open access reports and peer reviewed publications on the environmental presence of PFOA and GenX in environmental matrices such as surface water, groundwater, soil and vegetation. Published data on human exposure to PFOA and GenX (i.e. via drinking water and food as well as blood monitoring) were reviewed in order to assess the influence of the FPP on contamination of the local population. Concentrations in environmental and human exposure samples were compared to (inter)national quality standards or risk limits. The data showed higher PFOA and GenX concentrations in surface water, groundwater, soil and vegetation samples taken close to point sources, and the highest observed concentrations exceeded these standards and limits (except for PFOA in soil). Drinking water and food also contained higher PFOA and GenX concentrations in samples taken close to point sources compared to samples further away. Tolerable daily intake (TDIs) for both PFASs were exceeded, however, only in a maximum exposure scenario. Blood monitoring of the local population near the FPP, and FPP workers, confirmed high exposure can occur as blood concentrations of several individuals exceeded the safe level.

Consequently, in 2017 a local Atmospheric Decontamination Plan (ADP) defined goals that have been difficult to achieve. The purpose of this work is to show the effect on the emissions of PM2.5 when replacing the wood-based heating systems by electric space-heating with a horizon up to 2030. This is done by defining and comparing five scenarios based on the current public policies and 2 of electric-heating replacement. The study also shows the increase of the electricity demand in the zone, in the electric-heating scenarios. We find that the scenario with the largest impact is related to the appropriate use of the stoves, even before replacing them for electric air-conditioning systems. However, this scenario has shown to be difficult to be implemented in practice. The electric-heating replacement scenarios show that with a minimum rate of 742 changes per year, the emissions of PM2.5 start being reduced by 2030, while the energy consumption is increased in 27′556 MWh/year, representing an 8% of the overall electricity consumption in the city by 2030. © 2020 IEEE.","electric space-heating; electrification; local policies; pollution; scenarios","Air conditioning; Electric heating; Electric power utilization; Energy utilization; Electric air-conditioning systems; Electricity demands; Electricity-consumption; Fine particle matters; Heating system; Residential sectors; Space heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085575527

Waterlogged PELBR10-6000 surpassed control plant levels of CO2 assimilation rate and readily responded to the energy lack induced by hypoxia by activating the fermentative enzymes and alanine aminotransferase. Similar mechanisms were observed in BMX Potência, which restored metabolism to control levels at the end of the recovery.

This review summarizes current knowledge concerning bacterial volatile-mediated plant protection against abiotic and biotic stresses. It then discusses the translational potential of such metabolites or of their emitters for sustainable crop protection, the possible ways to harness this potential, and the major challenges still preventing us from doing so. Finally, the review concludes with highlighting the most pressing scientific gaps that need to be filled in order to enable a better understanding of: the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of bacterial volatiles; the complex regulation of bacterial volatile emission in natural communities; the perception of bacterial volatiles by plants; and the modes of actions of bacterial volatiles on their host. © 2019 The Authors.

It not only does damages to the physical health of the human body but also has adverse effects on mood, outdoor activities, and social interactions, which further reduces the vitality of the city. Dining out is an important way of social interaction for city residents. Using Beijing as an example, this paper aims to study the impacts of different air pollutants on dining-out activities and satisfaction of urban and suburban residents. The results show that: (1) Air pollution can significantly reduce dining-out frequency and satisfaction; (2) Due to differences in environmental and health awareness, the impact of air pollution on dining-out behaviors varies among urban and suburban residents; and (3) O3 pollution has a greater emotional impact on suburban residents than urban residents, possibly because of the differences in defense strategies and levels of pollution exposure in the workplace. The findings imply that improving air quality can obtain not only health benefits but also long-term social and economic vitality. The publicity of environment and health information should be strengthened on key urban air pollutants, especially on particulate matter and O3, and on disadvantaged groups to enhance environmental justice. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollutants; Dining-out activities; Dining-out satisfaction; Pollution aversion; Urban and suburban residents","air quality; atmospheric pollution; environmental justice; pollution exposure; public health; suburban area; urban pollution; urban population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083565473

Most available allometric models are not site-specific, and hence do not account for the effects of regional climate variabilities on tree growth and capacity to sequester carbon. In contrast, site-specific biomass allometric models constitute a robust tool for forest and carbon emission management in the context of the reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation program (REDD+). Although site-specific models have been developed for several tropical tree species, such models do not exist for Pterocarpus erinaceus in Burkina Faso. In this study, we investigated biomass fraction patterns and used a system of additive allometric models for predicting aboveground biomass and carbon stocks of P. erinaceus components. Thirty P. erinaceus trees were destructively sampled to estimate the biomass of their stems, branches and leaves. The biomass fraction of each component was assessed and its relationship with tree diameter at breast height (dbh) examined. The best allometric equations of the tree components, selected from three non-linear models with dbh, height (ht) and crown diameter (Cd) as predictors, were combined to develop an additive allometric model, using the Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) method. The Ash method was then used to estimate the carbon content of the different components. Leaf and stem biomass fractions decreased when the dbh increased, whereas a reverse trend was observed for branch biomass. Dbh was the most correlated independent variable with all biomass components. AGB = e−3.46(dbh)1.62+e−2.45(dbh)2.31+e−2.68(dbh) was the most appropriate additive allometric equation for estimating the biomass of P. erinaceus trees. The carbon content of the leaves, branches and stems was 55.73%, 56.68% and 56.23%, respectively. The developed allometric equations can be used to accurately estimate the aboveground biomass of P. erinaceus in the savannas of Burkina Faso and other similar ecosystems in Sub-Saharan Africa. © 2020 The Author(s)","Additive allometric models; Biological sciences; Biomass fraction; Carbon; Ecology; Environmental science; Plant biology; Savanna; Sub-Saharan Africa; Tree components",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083504776

This implies that the F-region ionosphere couples with the lower atmosphere through large-scale waves. A noteworthy phenomenon was that the Q16DOs displayed an asymmetric behavior between the northern and southern EIA crests. This asymmetry indicates that the ionospheric Q16DOs might be driven by the Q16DW-modulated tides, which not only modulated the E-region dynamo winds but also modulated the F-region field-aligned neutral winds via vertical penetration, producing the oscillations in plasmas densities. ©2020.

(2) Considering the operation of HSR, the ranking of contribution rate of driving factors for regional CO2 emissions is as follows: GDP per capita, energy consumption per unit of GDP, arrival volume of high-speed rail, originated volume of high-speed rail, the proportion of coal in the energy mix, proportion of the tertiary industry, and population. (3) Surprisingly, the numerical research result shows that the operation of HSR for the cities may promote regional CO2 emissions, while the increase in urban population and the optimization of energy structure have a reducing effect on regional carbon emissions. There is a transfer effect of the operation of HSR and region development, which results in the rising of regional CO2 emissions. Thus, it is urgent to research on the decoupling of economic growth from CO2 emissions. The findings could be conducive for the government and railway company to evaluate and administrate the operation of high-speed rail and adequately deal with the relationships between the high-speed railway and regional development. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed rail Hunan section; CO2 emissions; High-speed rail; STIRPAT","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; energy use; environmental economics; high-speed train; numerical model; regional development; China; Hunan; carbon dioxide; China; city; economic development; Beijing; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Economic Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079448912

In contrast to the summer season, the winter and spring β-1 values are reasonably high, where a tight correlation between the above-background mole fractions of CO and CO2 is exhibited (as given by the high R2 value). The winter season is characterized by relatively high COan than biospheric CO2 signals (CO2Bio) due to fossil fuel heating sources and reduced biospheric uptake of CO2. The lowest estimated seasonal background CO2 and CO mole fractions during the study period are 407.1 ± 11.3 ppm and 144.9 ± 2.1 ppb, respectively. During the summer, the biogenic CO source from isoprene oxidation collocates with direct anthropogenic CO sources, leading to uncertainties in the calculated summertime β-1 values. For 2017, β-1 values (ppb:ppm) of 9.7 ± 0.4, 5.3 ± 0.4, and 2.0 ± 0.2 were obtained for the winter, spring and summer seasons, respectively. In 2018, a similar seasonal variability in the β-1 ratios was obtained with values of 8.7 ± 0.5, 7.4 ± 0.7, and 2.6 ± 0.5 for winter, spring, and summer seasons, respectively. While the estimated percentage contribution of the oxidation reaction between the OH radical and isoprene (CH2=C(CH3)-CH=CH2 + OH) to the total summertime CO budget is less than 50%, the relative amounts may be significant enough to imply that any future study based on the CO as a tracer of combustion emission should account for its photochemical production through biogenic volatile organic compounds in the summertime. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","anthropogenic CO sources; biogenic volatile organic compounds; cavity-ring-down spectrometry; Eastern Highland Rim; ground-based atmospheric measurements; volatile organic compounds","anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; biological uptake; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; fossil fuel; ground-based measurement; photochemistry; reaction kinetics; seasonal variation; tracer; Cookeville; Highland Rim; Tennessee; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084659614

The effects of climate change are already beginning to be seen, but the subject of climate change is nevertheless modelled, imagined and contested in the future tense. Today's young people are similarly future oriented, but unlike older generations they will live to feel climate change's full future effects. This study investigates knowledge of and experiences with climate change among young adults in Miami, and their visions of the future in light of predicted changes. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 long-term residents of the city between the ages of 18 and 30 who were students at Miami-Dade College or Florida International University. I discuss participants’ sense of personal responsibility to inform themselves and the individualised understandings of climate science that emerge, their disillusionment with politics and resulting perception of individual responsibility for climate mitigation, and their negotiation of personal future plans in light of fatalistic visions of the future. These young adults’ perspectives on rising seas in their home city are revealed to be socially structured by ideals of individual agency and self-reliance, which become paradoxically disempowering because of the impossibility of addressing the transformational impacts of climate change through individualised means. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agency; climate change; future; individualism; Miami; youth","adult; climate change; climate effect; individualism; student; urban area; Florida [United States]; Miami; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082126432

In particular, the production, storage and re-utilization of hydrogen starting from renewable energy has proven to be one of the most promising solutions for offsetting seasonal mismatch between energy generation and consumption. A realistic possibility for large-scale hydrogen storage, suitable for long-term storage dynamics, is presented by salt caverns. In this contribution, we provide a framework for modeling underground hydrogen storage, with a focus on salt caverns, and we evaluate its potential for reducing the CO2 emissions within an integrated energy systems context. To this end, we develop a first-principle model, which accounts for the transport phenomena within the rock and describes the dynamics of the stored energy when injecting and withdrawing hydrogen. Then, we derive a linear reduced order model that can be used for mixed-integer linear program optimization while retaining an accurate description of the storage dynamics under a variety of operating conditions. Using this new framework, we determine the minimum-emissions design and operation of a multi-energy system with H2 storage. Ultimately, we assess the potential of hydrogen storage for reducing CO2 emissions when different capacities for renewable energy production and energy storage are available, mapping emissions regions on a plane defined by storage capacity and renewable generation. We extend the analysis for solar- and wind-based energy generation and for different energy demands, representing typical profiles of electrical and thermal demands, and different CO2 emissions associated with the electric grid. © 2019 The Authors","Hydrogen storage; Modeling; Multi-energy systems; Optimization; Salt cavern; Zero emissions","Carbon dioxide; Caves; Dynamics; Integer programming; Models; Optimization; Salt deposits; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy storage technologies; First principle modeling; Integrated energy systems; Mixed integer linear program; Multi-energy systems; Salt caverns; Zero emission; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077339750

This paper aim is to evaluate the current sensitivity to desertification of Basilicata region in southern Italy, where this phenomenon has been increasing over the past years, without control. Losses are strongly impacting on the potential regional progress, both economic and social, leading also to a huge ecological damage. The analysis was carried out based on the MEDALUS (MEditerrean Desertification and Land Use) model, developed within a dedicated European project. This method identifies the areas of the region that are more likely to be sensible to desertification thought the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) index. Starting with this methodology, the model parameters were implemented and then processed with a GIS-based approach, in order to evaluate soil, climate, management and vegetation quality factors, that represent the necessary input for assessing ESAs. The results were useful to indicate that the region is effectively lacking of management policies in those highly sensitive areas, due to a proved scarcity of previous studies on the topic. This study may open new opportunities for a further more conscious planning to prevent landscape, land and soil degradation. © 2020 ACM.","climate change; desertification; ESAs indicators; land degradation; landscape management planning; MEDALUS; NDVI; remote sensing; sensitivity; UNCCD","Climate change; Climate models; Data handling; Information analysis; Land use; Quality control; Remote sensing; Current sensitivity; Ecological damage; Environmental sensitivities; Environmentally sensitive areas; European project; Gis and remote sensing; Management policy; Mediterranean landscapes; Geographic information systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088572068

Since 1960, apparent dolomite formation has been reported from mud sediments of the shallow, oligohaline and alkaline Lake Neusiedl, Austria. To trace potential dolomite formation or diagenetic alteration processes in its deposits, lake water samples and sediment cores were analyzed with respect to sediment composition, hydrochemistry and bacterial community composition. Sediments comprise 20 cm of homogenous mud with 60 wt% carbonate, which overlies dark-laminated consolidated mud containing 50 wt%carbonate and plant debris. Hydrochemical measurements reveal a shift from oxic lake water with pH 9.0 to anoxic sediment pore water with pH 7.5. A decrease in SO2-4 with a concomitant increase in ΣH2S and NH+4 from 0 to 15 cm core depth indicates anaerobic heterotrophic decomposition, including sulfate reduction. The bacterial community composition reflects the zonation indicated by the pore water chemistry, with a distinct increase in fermentative taxa below 15 cm core depth. The water column is highly supersaturated with respect to (disordered) dolomite and calcite, whereas saturation indices of both minerals rapidly approach zero in the sediment. Notably, the relative proportions of different authigenic carbonate phases and their stoichiometric compositions remain constant with increasing core depth. Hence, evidence for Ca-Mg carbonate formation or ripening to dolomite is lacking within the sediment of Lake Neusiedl. As a consequence, precipitation of high-magnesium calcite (HMC) and protodolomite does not occur in association with anoxic sediment and sulfate-reducing conditions. Instead, analytical data for Lake Neusiedl suggest that authigenic HMC and protodolomite precipitate from the supersaturated, well-mixed aerobic water column. This observation supports an alternative concept to dolomite formation in anoxic sediments, comprising Ca- Mg carbonate precipitation in the water column under aerobic and alkaline conditions. © 2020 All rights reserved.",,"alkalinity; authigenic mineral; calcium; carbonate; decomposition; diagenesis; dolomite; hydrochemistry; lacustrine deposit; lake water; magnesium; microbial community; nucleation; saturation; sediment chemistry; sediment core; shallow water; sulfate; water column; Neusiedler See; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083735685

Past emission control has been ineffective in reducing winter nitrate. Here, we use extensive observations and a model with state-of-the-art nitrogen chemistry to identify the key factors that control the nitrate formation in the heavily polluted North China Plain (NCP). In contrast to the previous view of weak winter photochemistry, we show that the O3 and OH productions are sufficiently high in winter to facilitate fast gas-phase and heterogeneous conversion of NOX to nitrate over the NCP. Increasing O3 and OH productions from higher precursor levels and fast ROX cycling accelerate the nitrate generation during heavy pollution. We find that the 31.8% reduction of NOX emissions from 2010 to 2017 in the NCP lowers surface nitrate by only 0.2% and even increases nitrate in some polluted areas. This is mainly due to the increase of O3 and OH (by â&amp;circ;¼30%), which has subsequently increased the conversion efficiency of NOX to HNO3 (by 38.7%). Future control strategies for the winter haze should also aim to lower photochemical oxidants, via larger and synchronized NOX and VOCs emissions reduction, to overcome the effects of nonlinear photochemistry and aerosol chemical feedback.

A novel time-series analysis tool developed by Facebook, Prophet, is used to investigate the holiday, seasonal, and inter-annual patterns of PM2.5 and AOD at a rural station (RU) and an urban station (UR) in Beijing. PM2.5 shows a coherent decreasing tendency at both stations during 2014-2018, consistent with the implementation of the air pollution action plan at the end of 2013. RU is characterized by similar seasonal variations of AOD and PM2.5, with the lowest values in winter and the highest in summer, which is opposite that at UR with maximum AOD, but minimum PM2.5 in summer and minimum AOD, but maximum PM2.5 in winter. During the National Day holiday (1-7 October), both AOD and PM2.5 holiday components regularly shift from negative to positive departures, and the turning point generally occurs on October 4. AODs at both stations steadily increase throughout the daytime, which is most striking in winter. A morning rush hour peak of PM2.5 (7:00-9:00 local standard time (LST)) and a second peak at night (23:00 LST) are observed at UR. PM2.5 at RU often reaches minima (maxima) at around 12:00 LST (19:00 LST), about four hours later (earlier) than UR. The ratio of PM2.5 to AOD (η) shows a decreasing tendency at both stations in the last four years, indicating a profound impact of the air quality control program. η at RU always begins to increase about 1-2 h earlier than that at UR during the daytime. Large spatial and temporal variations of η suggest that caution should be observed in the estimation of PM2.5 from AOD. © 2020, by the authors.","AOD; Holiday effects; PM2.5; Prophet; Rural; Time-series; Urban","Air quality; Quality control; Rural areas; Aerodynamic diameters; Aerosol optical depths; Local standard time; Particulate Matter; Seasonal variation; Spatial and temporal variation; Temporal variability; Urban and rural areas; Time series analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084252889

However, in-cylinder fuel homogenization strongly depends on charge motion and injection strategies and can be challenging due to the reduced available time for mixture formation. An insufficient homogenization has generally a negative impact on the combustion and therefore also on efficiency and emissions. In order to reach the targets of the intensified CO2 emission reduction, further increase in efficiency of SI engines is essential. In this connection, 0D/1D simulation is a fundamental tool due to its application area in an early stage of development and its relatively low computational costs. Certainly, inhomogeneities are still not considered in quasi dimensional combustion models because the prediction of mixture formation is not included in the state of the art 0D/1D simulation. Therefore, a phenomenological homogenization model has been developed in this work based on 3D CFD simulations. The model is based on a finite volume approximation of the 2D convection diffusion equation representing the in-cylinder flow field. The velocity field is modelled as a Taylor-Green vortex according to an existing charge motion and turbulence model. Turbulence effect and the influence of piston motion on homogenization are also considered. As a result, the model is able to predict the progress of fuel homogenization as well as residual gas distribution, accounting for different cam profiles, injection strategies, engine loads and speeds. Furthermore, standard deviations representing the level of inhomogeneities are linked to the laminar flame speed of a quasi-dimensional combustion model to predict the impact of inhomogeneities on the burn rate. The influence of local air deficiency in inhomogeneous rich areas is also considered. The predictive capability was validated with measurement data and CFD simulations of two different engines. © 2020 SAE International.

Among the three main objectives in its energy policy is a reduction in greenhouse gases (mainly CO2) emissions to at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020. This study aims to assess the impact of international trade on actual CO2 emission in the EU, China and the USA for the period 1997-2017. For this aim, the Actual-Open CO2 emissions were calculated, taking into account the transfer of CO2 in exported products and services from China and the USA to the EU and vice versa. It is concluded that the actual CO2 emissions in China, the USA, and the EU differed from the traditionally calculated emissions. This has serious consequences for policy, as the factual level of implementation of the EU energy policy goals may be different from what is assumed. Without including the goals of energy policy into trade policy, the effectiveness of measures may be limited. This also has implications for the effectiveness of environmental management systems. When improvements rely on increasing trade with large CO2 emitting countries, the final effect may be opposed to the assumed effect. © 2020 by the authors.","Actual-Open CO2 emission; China; CO2 trade; EU energy policy; Sustainable development; USA","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; international trade; sustainable development; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084701682

Biomonitors can provide important information for ADM validation, but an open question is their temporal frame of application, particularly when native organisms are used. In this study, we tested two alternative ADM simulating the total suspended particulate (TSP) released by a coal power station, against the element content of two native lichens collected at 40 sites, integrated by soil samples. The ADM simulations differed by the time references: the 6-month period preceding lichen sampling, approximately corresponding to the estimated age of the samples (Mod. A), and the whole year 2005, representative of the local average conditions and used in the plant authorization processes (Mod. B). A generalized regression model analysis clearly showed that the Cr, Pb and V content of lichen samples was spatially associated to the outcomes of Mod. A, but not with Mod. B. Interestingly, the Cr content of lichen samples consistently correlated to TSP concentration predicted by Mod. A along two transects placed downwind from the coal power station. This result was corroborated by an air particulate matter sampling which pointed out that air Cr concentrations increased during the operative period of the source. Overall, our results suggest that lichen bioaccumulation data can proficiently be used to validate ADM simulations if the exposure time of the biological samples is consistent with the temporal domain of the ADM simulations. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; Bioaccumulation; Dispersion models; Enrichment factor; Exposure time; Lichen growth","atmospheric modeling; bioaccumulation; biomonitoring; concentration (composition); dispersion; lichen; model validation; native species; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; simulation; Italy; coal; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; Italy; lichen (organism); Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Italy; Lichens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079464219

They are known as sequential sedimentation-biofiltration systems (SSBSs) for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in urban rivers. Nutrient removal performances for both SSBSs were up to 55% for N-NO2, 46% for N-NO3 and 96% of TP, however, an increase of N-NH4 in the outflow was observed for the eight-year SSBS (Sok-SSBS). Analysis of microbial communities in sediments showed similar metabolic activity for all zones in both SSBSs, suggesting no significant difference according to the working time, but the lowest metabolic activity was observed for geochemical zones, which contained a limestone barrier for the removal of phosphorus. The quantity of key functional genes, involved in nitrogen transformation cycle, showed that denitrifying bacteria (up to 1.16 × 108 copies of nosZ gene g−1) were more abundant than nitrifying bacteria (up to 5.68 × 105 copies of amoA gene g−1) in SSBSs sediments. Maximum abundances of both gene copy numbers were observed in the denitrifying zone presented only in the two-year SSBS (Str-SSBS). The above results suggested that both SSBSs could be recommended as a useful solution to improve water quality in urban areas. However, the implementation of the denitrifying zone, containing brown coal, significantly increased the abundances of denitrifying and nitrifying bacterial communities. In consequence, the efficiency of N-NH4 removal in Str-SSBS could be enhanced compared to Sok-SSBS. Furthermore, microbial metabolic activity in geochemical zones could be strengthened with the application of biopolymers carrying additional carbon substrates, in order to promote biofilm formation in the limestone barrier. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Denitrifiers; Gene amoA; Gene nosZ; Microbial activity; Nitrifiers; Nutrients","Bacteria; Biofilters; Biofiltration; Biopolymers; Denitrification; Efficiency; Genes; Geochemistry; Lime; Limestone; Metabolism; Nitrification; Nitrogen removal; Phosphorus compounds; Water quality; Biofiltration systems; Denitrifiers; Genetic characteristics; Microbial activities; Nitrifiers; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Nitrogen transformations; Nutrient removal efficiency; Nutrients; biofilm; biofiltration; biotransformation; lignite; limestone; microbial community; outflow; phosphorus; sedimentation; water quality; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082833573

Nonetheless, several mechanisms of plant diversity patterns are unknown, especially for continental islands. In this paper, we explored how endemic and alien vascular plant species richness and the compositional dissimilarity of small Mediterranean continental islands vary according to factors related to human activities, geography/landscape, and climate. Actions for endemic plant conservation were also prioritised according to both endemic and alien components. To this aim, data of endemic and alien plant species for forty islands of Sardinia were considered. Species-area residuals, which express the actual species composition free of area-effects, were modelled using 19 variables related to anthropogenic, geographic/landscape and climatic domains (group of factors). The geographic/landscape domain appeared to be important for both endemic and alien species richness and compositional dissimilarity, while the climatic one was especially relevant for alien species richness. The anthropogenic domain was mostly important for the compositional dissimilarity of aliens and for the endemic species richness. Actions for endemic plant conservation were of high priority for 14 islands; 11 of which are located off the northwest coast of Sardinia.

In order to understand the interactions between clay surfaces and carbonate-precipitating solutions, we built model aqueous solutions of various compositions (containing Ca2+, Mg2+ and CO3 2– ions) between layers of clay minerals (montmorillonite and kaolinite), and performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations. The results were compared with simulations for bulk solutions. Contrary to intuition, ionic clusters formed preferentially in the interlayer solution (instead of on the clay surface). The clusters grew both by the association of individual ions and aggregation, and were adsorbed to the clay surfaces with distinctly different efficiencies in the various systems. Montmorillonite was found to be more efficient than kaolinite in capturing clusters from solution. However, the efficiency of anchoring ionic clusters to the clay surfaces strongly depended on the Na+ concentration of the solution, since Na+ appeared to strongly attach to the surface and thereby block it from clusters in the solution. Montmorillonite (and probably other smectite clays as well) may thus have an important role in certain, primarily freshwater, systems in the localization of ionic clusters on its surface, thereby promoting the nucleation and templated growth of crystalline calcium‑magnesium carbonate minerals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Calcite; Heterogeneous nucleation; Ionic clusters; Kaolinite; Molecular dynamics; Montmorillonite","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Clay minerals; Crystallization; Efficiency; Kaolinite; Nucleation; Bulk solutions; Carbonate formations; Cluster formations; Heterogeneous nucleation; Ionic clusters; Magnesium carbonate; Molecular dynamics simulations; Templated growth; Molecular dynamics; aqueous solution; calcite; calcium carbonate; ionic composition; kaolinite; molecular analysis; montmorillonite; nucleation; precipitation (chemistry); smectite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079221600

This is particularly important in built up areas, where localized emissions in the form of NOx and particulate matter may worsen health issues such as respiratory disease. However, high degrees of electrification also mean that waste heat from the internal combustion engine is often not available for heating the cabin and for maintaining the temperature of the powertrain and emissions control system. If not managed properly, this can result in increased fuel consumption, exhaust emissions, and reduced electric-only range at moderately high or low ambient temperatures negating many of the benefits of the electrification. This paper describes the development of a holistic, modular vehicle model designed for development of an integrated thermal energy management strategy. The developed model utilizes advanced simulation techniques, such as co-simulation, to incorporate a high-fidelity 1D thermo-fluid model, a multi-phase HVAC model, and a multi-zone cabin model within an existing longitudinal powertrain simulation environment. It is shown that the final model is useful of detailed analysis of thermal pathways including energy losses due to powertrain warm-up at various ambient temperatures and after periods of parked time. This enables identification of sources of energy loss and inefficiency over a wide range of environmental conditions. © 2020 SAE International; Loughborough University.",,"Electric utilities; Energy dissipation; Energy management; Powertrains; Temperature; Thermal energy; Waste heat; Waste incineration; Advanced simulation techniques; Emissions control systems; Environmental conditions; Full hybrid electric vehicles; Identification of sources; Low ambient temperatures; Powertrain simulation; Thermo-fluid model; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083839046

However, the interrelation of labile and recalcitrant pools with changes in plant functional groups (i.e., C3 and C4) along precipitation gradients is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the soil organic C and N (SOC and SON), labile C and N (LC and LN), recalcitrant C and N (RC and RN), and their isotopes (δ13C, and δ15N) in relation to C3 and C4 plant inputs from 20 sites across a 600-km precipitation gradient in secondary grasslands of South China. The SOC content decreased first slightly and then increased along precipitation gradients, largely due to the increase in C4 plant C inputs in the lower precipitation regions. In contrast, the SON content increased with increasing N inputs from C3 plant at higher precipitation regions. The LC and LN contents increased with increasing precipitation, whereas RC and RN did not change with precipitation. The LC and LN were correlated with plant C and N contents, as well as the mean annual precipitation, respectively. Increases in LC and LN stocks were tightly related to enhanced plant C and N inputs influenced by precipitation, suggesting stronger sensitivity of labile pools to both plant functional groups inputs and precipitation compared to the recalcitrant pool. Moreover, the δ13C values in RC declined with precipitation, while the δ15N values of both labile and recalcitrant N increased with increasing precipitation, further revealing that soil labile and recalcitrant C and N pools closely related to the shift in the C3 and C4 plant along precipitation gradients. Overall, our findings indicated that soil labile and recalcitrant fractions should be considered in context of precipitation under which plant inputs takes place in predicting soil C and N dynamics. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","C3 plant input; C4 plant input; Labile pools; Precipitation; Recalcitrant pools; Soil organic matter","grassland; plant; precipitation (climatology); soil nutrient; vegetation type; China; carbon; nitrogen; China; grassland; soil; Carbon; China; Grassland; Nitrogen; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078031359

Twenty-two different models have been developed and tested: eleven Multilinear Regression (MR) models and eleven Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) models, using combinations of variables such as Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Global Extraterrestrial Irradiance (G0), Temperature (T) and Relative Humidity (RH). Data provided by Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) are used to develop and train the models, while the models have been validated using field data from four stations located in Spain, covering the different study climates. According to the results, zones with different climate conditions need different models, both for the case of MR and ANN. The results show the need of including the GHI in all models in order to obtain accurate estimates; in fact, the presence of more variables only improves slightly the results in mediterranean climate, while in oceanic climate no improvement is observed. On the other hand, comparing MR and ANN models, ANN models did not show better results than those of MR models in no one of the cases studied. Regarding the climate, both types of models are clearly better for the mediterranean case than for the oceanic one. In order to improve the performance of the model for oceanic climate a correction based on the site adaptation technique was carried out. The good results obtained by this technique fully justify its use. The best proposed models provide better performance than other models which are restricted to certain locations. Besides, the clustering technique based on the PAR variable, used in this work, allows obtaining useful models for a whole region. Finally, another advantage of this methodology is that there is no need of ground measurements for its development, except for the site adaptation technique. © 2020 COSPAR","Artificial neuron network; Global horizontal irradiance; Multilinear regression; Photosynthetically active radiation; Site adaptation technique","Climatology; Neural networks; Adaptation techniques; Artificial neuron networks; Global horizontal irradiance; Multi-linear regression; Photosynthetically active radiation; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079744457

At the same time, the use of renewable energy sources is pursued to address decarbonization targets, but the stochasticity of renewable energy systems produces an increasing need for management systems to supply such energy volume while guaranteeing, at the same time, the security and reliability of the microgrids. Locally distributed energy storage systems (ESS) may provide the capacity to temporarily decouple production and demand. In this sense, the most implemented ESS in local energy districts are small–medium-scale electrochemical batteries. However, hydrogen systems are viable for storing larger energy quantities thanks to its intrinsic high mass-energy density. To match generation, demand and storage, energy management systems (EMSs) become crucial. This paper compares two strategies for an energy management system based on hydrogen-priority vs. battery-priority for the operation of a hybrid renewable microgrid. The overall performance of the two mentioned strategies is compared in the long-term operation via a set of evaluation parameters defined by the unmet load, storage efficiency, operating hours and cumulative energy. The results show that the hydrogen-priority strategy allows the microgrid to be led towards island operation because it saves a higher amount of energy, while the battery-priority strategy reduces the energy efficiency in the storage round trip. The main contribution of this work lies in the demonstration that conventional EMS for microgrids’ operation based on battery-priority strategy should turn into hydrogen-priority to keep the reliability and independence of the microgrid in the long-term operation. © 2020 by the authors.

Modeling approaches can be used to assess the impacts of climate change on tree crops for the past and forecast possible impacts for the future. We apply modeling approaches to assess climate change impacts on Chilean fruit production in nine major agricultural sites. Using a weather generator, we obtained 100 years of plausible weather data for scenarios produced by 15 climate models for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Winter chill, safe winter chill (both quantified in Chill Portions - CP), and the percentage of years with spring frost were estimated for two reference years, 2050 and 2085. Projections show a considerable chill reduction in northern regions in all future scenarios. Relatively stable conditions are projected for southern regions, whereas most of the central sites are expected to lose between 10 and 15 CP by 2050. For 2085, expected chill reduction is much more severe. The percentage of years with spring frost is projected to decrease in all locations, varying according to RCP scenario and year. Results highlight that in northern sites, some species may fail to meet their chill requirements in the future. In other regions, strategies to mitigate the effects of chill shortfalls may become critical to ensure adequate yields. Results may be useful for geneticists, breeders, physiologists, dormancy researchers, and growers making production decisions, e.g., on selection of appropriate species and varieties. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Bud rest; Chill models; Chill requirement; Food security; Fruit trees; Temperature increase","Composting; Crops; Food supply; Forestry; Fruits; Global warming; Orchards; Agricultural sites; Bud rest; Climate change impact; Food security; Fruit trees; Mediterranean climates; Production decisions; Temperature increase; Climate models; climate effect; crop yield; deciduous tree; fruit production; global warming; Mediterranean environment; twenty first century; winter; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077625192

We used a combined field and object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach, based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery, to assess C stock of three dominant riparian species. A linear discriminator was designed, based on a set of spectral variables previously selected in an optimal way, permitting the classification of the species corresponding to every object in the study area. This made it possible to estimate the area occupied by each species and its contribution to the tree aboveground biomass (AGB). Three uncertainty levels were considered, related to the trade-off between the number of unclassified and misclassified objects, leading to an error control associated with the estimated tree AGB. We found that riparian woodlands dominated by Acacia dealbata Link showed the highest average carbon stock per unit area (251 ± 90 tC ha-1) followed by Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertner (162 ± 12 tC ha-1) and by Salix salviifolia Brot. (73 ± 17 tC ha-1), which are mainly related to the stem density, vegetation development and successional stage of the different stands. The woody tree compartment showed the highest inputs (79%), followed by the understory vegetation (12%) and lastly by the soil mineral layer (9%). Spectral vegetation indices developed to suppress saturation effects were consistently selected as important variables for species classification. The total tree AGB in the study area varies from 734 to 1053 tC according to the distinct levels of uncertainty.

We propose a cellular automata model to predict land use scenarios and use these to estimate China's total carbon stock and its 2000–2030 variation. The results show that the total carbon stock of Chinese terrestrial ecosystems is ∼98 Gt. The total quantity decreases by 0.2% and the annual carbon emissions related to land use change decreases slightly during 2000–2030. Urban expansion in developed areas is the leading cause of carbon emissions, accounting for more than one-quarter of the carbon emissions in these areas. In other areas, the loss of forests and grasslands is the leading cause of carbon emissions, accounting for more than half of the emissions in these areas. In a few sub-regions, an increase of carbon stock is found that can be linked to environmental policies like Grain-for-Green.

In this study, we construct a regional air pollution data assimilation system based on the WRF/CMAQ model and ensemble Kalman filter algorithm to quantitatively optimize gridded CO emissions using hourly surface CO measurements over China. The Multi-resolution Emission Inventory of China CO emission inventories in December 2012 and 2016 are treated as prior emissions, and the CO emissions in December 2013 and 2017 are optimized using the CO observations of December of 2013 and 2017, respectively. The results show that in both periods, assimilation of CO observations significantly improves the CO simulations and emission estimates. Assimilation increases the CO emissions in most areas of mainland China, especially in northern China, and the spatial patterns of the increases in the two periods are similar. Overall, the posterior CO emissions in December 2017 are 17% lower than those in December 2013. Large emission decreases are mainly found in most key urban areas and developed regions, and emission increases are mainly located in their surrounding areas and certain central and western regions, which might reflect the emission migration from developed regions or urban areas to developing regions or surrounding areas. These changes are not found in the prior emissions but are basically consistent with the emission control strategies and industrial transformation and upgrade phenomena in recent years, indicating that our CO assimilation system could successfully capture the temporal and spatial variations. ©2020.

So, a TiN single-layer coating was formed using PVD method as well as CrN/TiN multilayer coating under totally the same conditions including deposition temperature, working pressure, bias voltage, cathode current and deposition time. To identify the phases in the coatings, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized in order and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was used in order to study the microstructure of coating. Potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were also carried out for corrosion measurements. In the corrosion evaluation, the PDP and EIS tests were performed for the samples after immersion in Hank’s solution for 24 hours to reach the steady state. The obtained results from PDP curves showed that the specimen with CrN/TiN multilayer coating exhibited better corrosion behavior than the TiN single-layer coatings. This improvement in corrosion resistance is probably due to the high density of the layers in the CrN/TiN multilayer coating that prevents the penetration of the corrosive solution to the substrate. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

One challenge is developing operating policies for an unknown and uncertain future. Here, we develop a suite of ‘optimal’ operating policies for the reservoir system of Portland, Oregon. We assess the sensitivity of projected reservoir reliability to the choice of GCMs and time periods used to develop each of our policies. Results indicate that, while different GCMs and fitting periods produce different optimal operating policies, when those policies are applied across all the other GCM scenarios, the overall projected reliability does not change due to the great variability between simulations. Across the simulations, we note a trend of decreasing reliability in the future which is not sensitive to the choice of GCM or fitting period. This indicates that the projected reliability is dominated by uncertainty in climate projections that cannot be mitigated by tuning operating policies to projected changes. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Emission Scenario; GCMs; Operation Policy; Reliability; Runoff","Reliability; Reservoir management; Climate projection; Operating policies; Optimal operating policy; Portland , Oregon; Reservoir reliability; Reservoir systems; Time-periods; Climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; policy approach; reliability analysis; reservoir; sensitivity analysis; Bull Run Basin; Oregon; Portland [Oregon]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083790746

Titan in particular harbours a rich hydroclimate replete with valley networks, lakes, seas and putative wetlands, all of which are pronounced in the lower-elevation polar regions. However, understanding of Titan’s global climate has heretofore neglected the hydraulic influence of Titan’s large-scale topography. Here we add a surface hydrology model to an existing Titan atmospheric model, and find that infiltration, groundmethane evaporation, and surface and subsurface flow are fundamental to simultaneously reproducing Titan’s observed surface liquid distribution and other aspects of its climate system. We propose that Titan’s climate features infiltration into unsaturated low- and mid-latitude highlands and surface or subsurface flow into high-latitude basins, producing the observed polar moist climes and equatorial deserts. This result implies that a potentially massive unobserved methane reservoir participates in Titan’s methane cycle. It also illustrates the importance of surface hydrology in Titan climate models, and by extension suggests the influence of surface hydrology in idealized models of other planetary climates, including the climates and palaeoclimates of Earth, Mars and exoplanets. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076533860

The operational energy needs of buildings are highly dependent on various building physical, operational, and functional characteristics, as well as meteorological and temporal properties. Besides physics-based energy modeling of buildings, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to provide faster and higher accuracy estimates, given buildings' historic energy consumption data. Looking beyond individual building levels, forecasting building energy performance can help city and community managers have a better understanding of their future energy needs, and to plan for satisfying them more efficiently. Focusing at an urban scale, this research develops a campus energy use prediction tool for predicting the effects of long-term climate change on the energy performance of buildings using AI techniques. The tool comprises four steps: Data Collection, AI Development, Model Validation, and Model Implementation, and can predict the energy use of campus buildings with 90% accuracy. We have relied on energy use data of buildings situated in the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida (FL).

The first WRF ensemble is performed under current land use and land cover, while the second is carried out after introducing a virtual large and shallow surface water reservoir (a lake) in Chott el-Jerid. The most pronounced effects generated by the artificial lake are circumscribed over its surface and slightly spread downwind to the other parts of the Chott. The lake has a clear moderating effect on near-surface air temperatures by increasing (decreasing) the wintertime (summertime) air temperatures. Sensible heat fluxes are remarkably increased in winter and decreased in summer over the lake following the temperature gradient between the lake surface and the overlying atmosphere. Latent heat fluxes, moisture convergence, and water vapor mixing ratio are increased over the lake throughout the year, especially in winter. The lake also induces domain-wide decreased (increased) surface pressures and land (lake) breeze circulation in winter (summer). Simulated rainfall amounts are most increased over the lake in winter likely because of an enhanced atmospheric instability, while they slightly decrease in summer. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial lake; Chott el-Jerid; Regional arid climate; WRF ensembles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077621298

A national target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035 has been declared. As a part of this, the use of coal for energy purposes has been banned from May 2029 onwards. The Nordic electricity market was a world forerunner in creating a liberalized, multi-national electricity market in the 1990s. At present, the electricity systems of Finland, Sweden, and Norway are already very low-carbon. The Baltic countries Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the Nordic market about a decade ago. Estonian electricity production is the most carbon-intensive of all the EU countries due to the extensive use of domestic oil shale. Especially Lithuania still suffers from capacity deficit created by the closure of the Soviet time nuclear reactor Ignalina in Lithuania. This paper presents the ambitions of the EU and national level energy and climate policies and models the multi-national impacts of Finland's forthcoming closure of coal-fired generation. We also take into account Sweden's planned decrease in nuclear generation. We find that these national-level policies have an impact on the Baltic countries as reduced import possibilities and increasing electricity prices, and the expected rise of the EU CO2 allowance prices amplifies these. We further find that the abandonment of coal and nuclear power plants increases the net import and increases CO2 emissions in neighboring regions. © 2020 by the authors.

Input and output variables, GHG scopes, allocation principles and mathematical formulations are described, followed by a discussion of the differences and similarities between methods. Findings: The authors show GHG emission mitigation scenarios are as important in the determination of targets as the allocation principle. Practical implications: For this reason, businesses should apply well-bellow 2ºC scenarios with robust sectoral and regional granularity and the science community should consider the needs of these groups of stakeholders. Social implications: Policymakers should actively support efforts by corporations to set science-based targets and ensure that the research they commission can be translated into practical action by non-party stakeholders.

The characteristic of biomass, the demand for products, and the local constraints determine the sustainability of utilisation. Generic principles and criteria can be applied to the analysis of specific instances. This work develops a decision-making tool for determining the most sustainable use of biomass for carbon management. The mathematical principles are based on break-even analysis and are visualised in the form of a graphical display for transparent communication of results to decision-makers. An essential feature of this tool is that it allows the Emissions-Cost Nexus to be considered in identifying the most sustainable biomass utilisation pathway under different baseline conditions. Economic instruments such as carbon emissions tax can also be determined and calibrated to direct decisions to specific pathways. The use of this tool is illustrated with a case study considering the pyrolysis of two different sources of biomass (residual biomass and energy crop) and plastic waste. Pyrolysis optimised for energy production is generally preferable unless biochar produced is at the quality for soil amendment. However, the change in baseline conditions, e.g. energy demand or carbon emission intensity, could overturn the initially selected utilisation. This result highlights the importance of a better standard to define avoided emissions for appropriate decision making. The case study also suggested that corn stover optimised for energy has a better emission-cost performance than optimised for biochar and carbon sequestration, unless the multiplier effect of biochar application to soil is higher than 1.4. The presented study shows the applicability of the developed method as a useful tool for sustainable biomass and product utilisation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Biomass utilisation; Carbon management; Greenhouse gases mitigation; Pyrolysis","Biomass; Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Crops; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Pyrolysis; Soils; Base-line conditions; Bio chars; Carbon emission intensities; Carbon management; Decision making tool; Economic instruments; Mathematical principle; Principles and criterion; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081225383

According to the maximum electric power and all-electric range, PHEVs are divided into two categories, including ""all-electric PHEV"" and ""blended PHEV"" and the latter provides a potential for more rational energy distribution because engine participates in vehicle driving during aggressive acceleration not just by motor. However, the frequent use of engine may result in severe emissions especially in low state of charge (SOC) and ahead of catalyst light-off. This study quantitatively investigates the impact of oil viscosity and driving mode (hybrid/conventional) on oil dilution and emissions including particle number (PN). Two cycles, WLTC (World-wide Harmonized Light Duty Driving Test Cycle) and continuous ECE 15 (European Driving Cycle), were adopted and initial SOC was controlled in the range of 10-13%, which can induce more engine start events. Oil dilution is detected through method of ASTM D3525-04 to identify dilution rate under different conditions. Results show that both in WLTC and ECE 15, frequent engine start will causes high PN and unburned hydrocarbon emissions while NOx is substantially reduced due to relatively low engine loads except in first cold start. Intermittent engine start also significantly accelerates dilution rate but this rate for 5W-30 increases more rapidly than 0W-20 does in hybrid driving mode. Moreover, 5W-30 oil increases fuel consumption due to higher friction work compared to 0W-20 does and the emission of PN along with NOx and THC is also increased. © 2020 SAE International.

To this end, Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) can improve the understanding of stochastic in-cylinder phenomena during the engine design process, if the employed modeling approach is sufficiently accurate. In this work, an inhouse code has been used to investigate CCV in a direct-injected spark ignition (DISI) engine under fuel-lean conditions with respect to a stoichiometric baseline operating point. It is shown that the crank angle when a characteristic fuel mass fraction is burned, e.g. MFB50, correlates with the equivalence ratio computed as a local average in the vicinity of the spark plug. The lean operating point exhibits significant CCV, which are shown to be correlated also with the in-cylinder subfilter-scale (SFS) kinetic energy. To assess the predictive capabilities of the turbulent combustion modeling approach, an engine-relevant Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) dataset of lean premixed flame propagation in homogeneous isotropic turbulence is considered for a-posteriori investigations. LES predictions using the Flame Front/Progress Variable Equation Model are demonstrated to be in good agreement with the DNS results. Integral flame propagation results are shown to be unaffected by the choice of two eddy viscosity models, although noticeable differences in the SFS velocity distributions near the flame front exist between the Dynamic Smagorinsky Model (DSM) and the Coherent Structure Model (CSM). © 2020 SAE International.

The 2017 Kenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Strategy claims to guide a transformation of Kenya's agricultural system through an integrated approach to agriculture, climate change, development, environment, and food security. By undertaking a longitudinal analysis of policy frames, this study temporally contextualizes climate-smart agriculture (CSA) policy adoption to understand whether CSA is a transformative tool versus business-as-usual. A policy frame analysis of the Ministries of Agriculture and Environment between 2002 and 2017, complemented with in-depth interviews addresses the question how policy frames for agriculture, climate change, development, environment and food security have evolved over time, and which factors contributed to policy frame development in Kenya. Findings demonstrate that (a) CSA in Kenya is an incremental shift away from existing policy frames rather than a radical transformation, (b) a discrepancy exists between Strategic Plans and sectoral policies; and (c) policy frames are influenced by donors, regional and global fora and personal networks. This study suggests that CSA's relevance is limited to those contexts that acknowledge a complex relationship between agriculture, climate change, development, environment, and food security prior to CSA policy adoption. © 2020 The Author","Climate-smart agriculture; Frame analysis; Kenya; Nexus approach; Policy change; Policy frame","adoption; adult; agriculture; article; climate change; food security; human; interview; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079608666

The objective of this study is to quantify the relationship between CO2 emission and urban form, using panel data analysis for Iran's 15 cities from 2001 to 2015. Therefore, a series of urban form indicators were selected which were measured by applying spatial landscape metrics to remotely sensed data. The results of the study expressed a positive correlation between CO2 emission levels and the growth of urban areas. In addition, increased urban complexity represented a positive relationship with CO2 emissions and conversely, increased urban compactness led to reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The findings of this research indicate that measures to make existing cities in northern Iran more compact may in fact help to decrease the CO2 emissions level, just as increasing fragmentation or increased complexity with respect to urban form may contribute to increase carbon dioxide emissions. Urban planners and decision makers should consider urban form to obtain significant reduction in CO2 emissions which subsequently leads to low carbon cities development in Iran. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Centrality; Compactness; Complexity; Landscape; Low carbon city",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084377677

Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection is one of the methods that can be used to increase oil recovery and store the CO2 in the reservoir via adsorption. This research investigates the CO2 storage applicability in the North East Oklahoma shale, which is part of the southern section of the Kansas Basin for CO2 storage, as well as the factors impacting the storage capacity. The shale mineralogy was initially identified using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis. CO2 adsorption on shale was measured using a volumetric-based adsorption apparatus. The effect of varying the CO2 phase, injection pressure, temperature, shale particle size, and shale volume in the sample cell was studied. Increasing the pressure resulted in an increase in adsorption, whereas increasing the temperature showed an opposite trend. No trend can be observed when decreasing the shale volume, since decreasing the volume using the volumetric adsorption apparatus will result in erroneous results. This research investigates and highlights the main factors that will impact CO2 adsorption to North East Oklahoma shale during CO2 injection in order to assess the applicability of CO2 injection storage purposes. © 2020","Carbon dioxide adsorption; Unconventional shale; Volumetric method","Gas adsorption; High pressure effects; Minerals; Particle size; Particle size analysis; X ray diffraction analysis; Carbon dioxide adsorption; Current increase; High pressure high temperature; Hydrocarbon production; Injection pressures; Storage capacity; Unconventional oil and gas; Volumetric methods; Carbon dioxide; adsorption; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; high pressure; high temperature; mineralogy; particle size; shale; Kansas; Kansas Basin; Oklahoma [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079681244

Plants can influence soil CO2 emissions through specific effects on soil humidity, soil temperature and soil microbial communities. These plant-soil effects mostly come via litter production and root exudates, enhancing soil autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration. We explored how plant species affected soil CO2 emissions in an arid environment. We altered soil temperature in bare soil and under the canopy of four plant species differing in functional type, and measured monthly fluxes to establish seasonal patterns of CO2 release along a 20-month period. We found that soil temperature explained 69% of the annual soil respiration (SR) variance, while soil water content explained 71% of SR variance. When we included plant species identity in the model, soil temperature and soil water content explained 76% and 81% of SR variance, respectively, exemplifying how plant species modulate SR responses as a function of temperature and water availability. Our results demonstrate that plant species influence soil carbon balance and emphasize that species identity matters in dry ecosystems. SR dynamics in dry ecosystems can be accurately modelled with soil water and temperature as predictors, but models are more efficient if plant species identity is considered. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arid plant communities; Climate change; Seasonal CO2 emissions; Soil respiration models","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Soil moisture; Temperature; Autotrophic and heterotrophic respirations; CO2 emissions; Plant communities; Soil microbial community; Soil respiration; Soil water content; Total ecosystem respirations; Water availability; Ecosystems; arid region; bare soil; carbon balance; prediction; scrub; seasonality; soil organic matter; soil respiration; soil temperature; soil water; water content",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077494821

In this study, Ahmed bodies are used to investigate the effects of the rear slant angle of a leading vehicle on the mean flow and turbulent statistics between two vehicles. The experiments were conducted with a particle image velocimetry at a fixed Reynolds number, ReH = 1.7 x 104, and inter-vehicle spacing distance of 0.75L, where H and L are the height and length of the model. The rear slant angles investigated were a reference square back, high-drag angle (α = 25°) and low-drag angle (α = 35°). The mean velocities, Reynolds stresses, production of turbulent kinetic energy and instantaneous swirling strength are used to provide physical insight into the wake dynamics between the two bodies. The results indicate that the recirculation region behind the square back Ahmed body increases while those behind the slant rear-end bodies decreases in the presence of a follower. For the square back models, the dominant motion in the wake region is a strong upwash of jet-like flow away from the road but increasing the rear slant angle induces a stronger downwash flow that suppresses the upwash and dominates the wake region. © 2020 by the authors.","Ahmed body; Bluff body aerodynamics; In-cabin air pollution; Wake flows","Drag; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Reynolds number; Rhenium compounds; Velocity measurement; Wakes; In-line vehicles; Leading vehicle; Mean velocities; Recirculation regions; Reynolds stress; Turbulent kinetic energy; Turbulent statistics; Wake dynamics; Automobile bodies; atmospheric pollution; drag; experimental study; flow field; indoor air; jet flow; particle image velocimetry; recirculating system; Reynolds number; turbulent flow; wake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084753007

To address this need, this paper introduces and utilizes the decoupled net present value (DNPV) valuation methodology. DNPV is a robust method that can incorporate climate change risk into investment analyses. This paper also discusses how the widespread use of traditional valuation methods such as net present value combined with risk-adjusted discount rates introduces a pernicious time bias effect that magnifies stakeholders’ misaligned interests and investment horizons, leading investors, both public and private, to significantly underinvest in resilience and adaptation. Furthermore, because traditional valuation methods cannot correlate physical risks (e.g., loss of revenue due to physical damage or lost access to an asset) with discount rates, investments to reduce climate change risks are largely considered as expenses that make the investment less attractive. The DNPV method addresses this issue and offers a viable alternative that can consistently and transparently quantify all risks (market and non-market) in terms of cash flows. This allows investors and stakeholders to quantify in monetary terms the potential exposure of physical assets to climate-related hazards and assess the effect of decisions to invest in resilience and adaptation measures. With the aid of a simple numerical example, the DNPV method is used to illustrate how such actions can be treated as quantifiable risk reduction investment opportunities that result in better investment decisions. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; DNPV; Project finance; Resilience; Risk analysis; Valuation","climate change; climate effect; decision making; discount rate; monetary policy; risk assessment; stakeholder",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069967453

In addition, there is an increased interest in growing hops in other warmer regions of the United States. To understand how hop plants respond to high temperatures, we measured several physiological traits of six hop cultivars under a range of temperatures from 15 to 45 8C. We found that hop plants achieved maximal carbon assimilation at temperatures of 21 to 39 8C when given sufficient water. At temperatures of 41 8C and higher, all cultivars experienced declines in carbon assimilation. This was likely due to multiple effects on the cell, including damage to photosystem II (PSII), as reflected in declines in FV/FM, damage to membrane integrity as reflected in electrolyte leakage at high temperatures, and declines in Rubisco activity likely due to degradation of Rubisco activase, as reflected in declines in Vc,max. 'Cascade', 'Willamette', and 'Southern Brewer' may be good candidates for growing in warm climates because all experience relatively high rates of carbon assimilation at high temperatures and did not experience significant declines in FV/FM or increases in electrolyte leakage. 'Chinook' appeared susceptible to extreme heat stress and exhibited evidence of irreparable damage to PSII and membrane integrity at 45 8C. © 2020 American Society for Horticultural Science.

This study investigates the socioeconomic drivers of the sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration changes in Ulaanbaatar between 2005 and 2015 by applying the index decomposition analysis (IDA) method. Five socio-economic driving forces are considered in the decomposition analysis. All the driving forces contributed to more air pollution concentration changes in 2015 than in 2005, despite the decreasing trends of decomposition results for the period of 2010-2015. In general, economic growth, pollution intensity, and energy intensity significantly contributed to the changes of air pollutant concentrations, while energy structure and population growth had marginal effects. Finally, appropriate policy recommendations are proposed to the local government so that they can initiate feasible policies to effectively reduce air pollution, protect human health, and respond to climate change in Ulaanbaatar. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollutants; Driving forces; Governance; Index decomposition analysis; NO2; PM2.5; SO2; Ulaanbaatar city","atmospheric pollution; capital city; climate change; combustion; concentration (composition); decomposition analysis; economic growth; energy intensity; fossil fuel; index method; local government; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; population growth; sulfur dioxide; Central Province [Mongolia]; Mongolia; Ulaanbaatar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084522318

A key question is how habitat management can proactively generate microclimatic refugia to maintain locally favourable conditions despite macroclimatic change. This study uses woodland epiphytes as a case-study, to answer this question. Field sampled data documented a cross-scale response of the conservation-priority lichen – Lobaria pulmonaria – to macroclimate, and, representing microclimates, the distance to watercourse and bryophyte association. The field sampled response was tested against experimental growth rates in a factorial design with respect to two climatically-contrasting sites (Benmore and Dawyck Botanic Gardens, in northern Britain), four watercourse distances, for lichens with and without bryophyte association. When measured for a summer dry period, the sites, watercourse distances and bryophyte associations had significantly different vapour pressure deficit (VPD) experienced by the lichen thalli, and therefore affecting physiological response. Furthermore, the field sampled response and growth rates were consistent, supporting the use of riparian woodland with a buffer of c. 500 m as an adaptation option that would allow lichen populations to adjust position (further or nearer from a watercourse) as they migrate locally into microclimatic space when responding to macroclimatic change. Microhabitat complexity (areas with and without bryophytes) would facilitate this process. These results are relevant to rare and threatened conservation priority epiphytes – including temperate rainforest species – lending additional support to the bundle of ecosystem services provided by riparian woodland. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Lichen; Microclimate; Niche","Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Fungi; Physiological models; Population statistics; Adaptation; Climate change adaptation; Conservation priorities; Lichen; Microclimate; Niche; Physiological response; Vapour pressure deficits; Climate change; adaptive management; bryophyte; climate change; conservation management; lichen; microclimate; niche partitioning; refugium; riparian forest; riparian vegetation; Adaptation; Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Fungi; United Kingdom; bryophytes; Lobaria pulmonaria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080093007

The primary research targets of these expeditions were glaciers (there are about 990 photographs of at least 58 named glaciers), but there are also photographs of people, villages, and geomorphological features, including glacial features in the formally glaciated regions of New York state. Some of the glaciers featured in the photographs have retreated significantly in the last century or even completely vanished. The images document terminus positions and ice elevations for many of the glaciers and some glaciers have photographs from multiple viewpoints that may be suitable for ice volume estimation through photogrammetric methods. While some of these photographs have been used in publications in the early 20th century, most of the images are only now widely available for the first time. The digitized collection also includes about 300 lantern slides made from the expedition photographs and other related images and used in classes and public presentations for decades. The archive is searchable by a variety of terms including title, landform type, glacier name, location, and date. The images are of scientific interest for understanding glacier and ecological change; of public policy interest for documenting climate change; of historic and anthropological interest as local people, settlements, and gold-rush era paraphernalia are featured in the images; and of technological interest as the photographic techniques used were cutting edge for their time. © Author(s) 2020.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083012934

As the land patterns change, the capacity of the landscape to regulate the UHI can change. The aim of this paper is to explore how simulating land cover changes (LCC) may affect UHI using an ecosystem service matrix approach. A LCC model, illustrated in the case study of Lisbon, Portugal, was implemented to estimate the UHI effects over time starting from the modelling of land cover changes associated with the supply of local climate regulation service. Our results show that the capacity of urban landscape to mitigate the UHI effect has decreased since 1990, and will continue to decrease slightly until 2022 although more smoothly than between 1990 and 2000. This is because no substantial land cover changes have occurred after 2000 that required the transition between highest to lowest ecosystem service supplier landscapes. The proposed modelling approach may be refined and used to aiding the decision making process for urban planners in the placement of built structures and green spaces that have the capacity to regulate local climate. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Cellular automata; Ecosystem services; Land cover change; Lisbon; Local climate regulation; Urban heat island","cellular automaton; decision making; ecosystem service; heat island; indoor air; land cover; numerical model; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081723347

Review of empirical study between financial developments, with trade, and the consumption of energy on emissions of CO2 has revealed no consensus in the literature. Therefore, this research scrutinizes the inference of financial development, receptivity of trade, and the utilization of energy on the effusion of CO2. The present study adopts FMOLS {fully modified ordinary least squares} and DOLS {dynamic ordinary least squares} estimators to investigate the nexus between the outlined variables for the case of ten MENA countries for annual data from 1970 to 2017. The major findings provide proof of a negative linkage between financial development and that of CO2 emission. Hence, higher financial development in the region over time will lead to more reduction of CO2 emission. However, the trade receptivity and energy utilization result to positive remarkable influence on the effusion of CO2. The major policy inference from this study is that expansion of trade or increase in trade openness as suggest by Environmental Kuznets curve phenomenon will reduce the emission of carbon in MENA region in the long run. Also, financial development causes a reduction in emission of carbon in the region. Thus, it is very essential for policymakers and government administrators of MENA countries to promote policies and activities that will enhance development financially and trade receptivity in the region. Energy consumption is found to increase the emission of carbon in the region; thus, there is need to ensure implementation of policies designed to secure efficient energy use and energy supply at the same actualizing the target of having supportable environment and enlargement of MENA nations’ far-reaching projects in renewable energy. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon effusions; Energy utilization; Financial development; MENA countries; Trade receptivity","alternative energy; carbon dioxide; economic development; energy use; environmental economics; finance; Kuznets curve; policy implementation; policy making; trade openness; trade-environment relations; carbon dioxide; economic development; least square analysis; policy; pollution; renewable energy; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Environmental Pollution; Least-Squares Analysis; Policy; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078766021

While local politicians are limited in many respects, their control over land use and transportation policy provides them with powerful tools to reduce Americans’ reliance on cars–thereby decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Using six years of novel elite survey data, we find that mayors are strongly committed to addressing climate change and reducing their communities’ reliance on cars. They are also supportive of some specific policies–including the construction of dense, multifamily housing and bicycle lanes–that would decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Other policy views, though, reveal that mayors do not consistently endorse evidence-based transportation policy practices that would make walking and cycling safe and attractive modes of transit. Insufficient knowledge, a lack of funding, partisan polarization, and public opposition all pose potent obstacles to mayors taking the lead on climate change. © 2020 De Gruyter.

As the geographic range and incidence of arthropod-borne infectious diseases is being affected by climate change, co-infection cases with Plasmodium and Babesia are likely to increase. The two parasites have been used in experimental settings, where prior infection with Babesia microti has been shown to protect against fatal malarial infections in mice and primates. However, the immunological mechanisms behind such phenomena of cross-protection remain unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of a primary B. microti infection on the outcome of a lethal P. chabaudi challenge infection using a murine model. Simultaneous infection with both pathogens led to high mortality rates in immunocompetent BALB/c mice, similar to control mice infected with P. chabaudi alone. On the other hand, mice with various stages of B. microti primary infection were thoroughly immune to a subsequent P. chabaudi challenge. Protected mice exhibited decreased levels of serum antibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines during early stages of challenge infection. Mice repeatedly immunized with dead B. microti quickly succumbed to P. chabaudi infection, despite induction of high antibody responses. Notably, cross-protection was observed in mice lacking functional B and T lymphocytes. When the role of other innate immune effector cells was examined, NK cell-depleted mice with chronic B. microti infection were also found to be protected against P. chabaudi. Conversely, in vivo macrophage depletion rendered the mice vulnerable to P. chabaudi. The above results show that the mechanism of cross-protection conferred by B. microti against P. chabaudi is innate immunity-based, and suggest that it relies predominantly upon the function of macrophages. Further research is needed for elucidating the malaria-suppressing effects of babesiosis, with a vision toward development of novel tools to control malaria. © Copyright © 2020 Efstratiou, Galon, Wang, Umeda, Kondoh, Terkawi, Kume, Liu, Ringo, Guo, Gao, Lee, Li, Moumouni, Nishikawa, Suzuki, Igarashi and Xuan.","Babesia microti; babesiosis; cross-protection; infection; innate immunity; macrophages; malaria; Plasmodium chabaudi","antibody; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 2; tumor necrosis factor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody blood level; antibody response; Article; B lymphocyte; Babesia microti; controlled study; cross protection; cytokine production; female; humoral immunity; immunization; in vivo study; innate immunity; macrophage; macrophage function; mortality rate; mouse; nonhuman; piroplasmosis; Plasmodium chabaudi infection; primary infection; T lymphocyte; animal; Bagg albino mouse; macrophage; malaria; piroplasmosis; Animals; Babesia microti; Babesiosis; Macrophages; Malaria; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084665696

Public transport systems are a good strategy to reduce these, but the emissions generated by public transport vehicles should not be neglected during the design of the service. The Transit Network Design and Frequency Setting Problem (TNDFSP) has usually been addressed considering only the passengers’ and the operator's point of view. However, we show it is worthwhile to consider also the emissions already during this planning phase. This paper proposes a memetic algorithm to address the bi-objective TNDFSP where both the total travel time and the CO2 emissions are minimized. The analysis considers a heterogeneous fleet, meaning that buses of different sizes and technologies can be assigned under a budget constraint. The results on benchmark instances show that the proposed memetic algorithm performs as well as state-of-the-art algorithms where CO2 emissions are not considered. In addition, several experiments are carried out to observe the effect of incorporating emissions and heterogeneous fleet into the model. The heterogeneous fleet allows reducing travel times and emissions at the same time, compared to solutions without a heterogeneous fleet. Moreover, the explicit minimization of CO2 emissions within a bi-objective framework allows illustrating the trade-off between both objectives. Reductions of about 30% in the emissions can be achieved by increasing the travel time only 1%, while the costs for the operator remain the same. This clearly demonstrates the benefits of considering both the CO2 emissions and a heterogeneous fleet during the design stage of public transport systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bi-objective memetic algorithm; CO2 emissions; Frequency Setting; Transit Network Design; Transportation","Benchmarking; Bismuth compounds; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Fleet operations; Transportation; Travel time; CO2 emissions; Frequency setting; Heterogeneous fleet; Memetic algorithms; Public transport systems; Public transport vehicles; State-of-the-art algorithms; Transit network design; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073828469

Strategies to manage natural resources are often not effective, or do not have intended outcomes, if they do not account for local contexts and the varied needs and constraints of stakeholders who rely upon natural resources for their livelihoods. Through fieldwork in Ba, Fiji, local insights were generated concerning the institutional, geographic, and socio-economic factors which determine and challenge i) different stakeholders' ability to access landscape resources, and ii) stakeholders' capacities to benefit from ecosystem services. The following insights were generated from this research which are important for guiding management of landscape multifunctionality. In Ba, hierarchical governance systems present barriers to effective management of landscape multifunctionality, and projects or policies with aims to manage landscapes should establish context appropriate multi-scale governance. Such governance systems should facilitate communication and interaction between different stakeholders, build upon community knowledge, and support communities as key actors in landscape management. Consideration of the spatial footprint of landscape resources, stakeholders' different physical and financial capacities, and the institutional structures that mediate access to resources should be central to landscape management and planning. Various climatic stressors affect flows of ecosystem services from the Ba landscape and people's capacity to access landscape resources; therefore, it is important that management of landscapes also builds resilience to climate stressors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Fiji; Multifunctional landscapes; Pacific Islands; Socio-ecological systems","carbon footprint; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem service; fieldwork; land management; stakeholder; Article; community; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental policy; field work; Fiji; financial management; geography; interpersonal communication; knowledge; landscape; Pacific islands; socioeconomics; Pacific islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079165564

Yet, biodiversity scenarios have so far concentrated on climatic effects because forecasts of land use are rarely available at appropriate spatial and thematic scales. Agent-based models (ABMs) represent a potentially powerful but little explored tool for establishing thematically and spatially fine-grained land-use scenarios. Here, we use an ABM parameterized for 1,329 agents, mostly farmers, in a Central European model region, and simulate the changes to land-use patterns resulting from their response to three scenarios of changing socio-economic conditions and three scenarios of climate change until the mid of the century. Subsequently, we use species distribution models to, first, analyse relationships between the realized niches of 832 plant species and climatic gradients or land-use types, respectively, and, second, to project consequent changes in potential regional ranges of these species as triggered by changes in both the altered land-use patterns and the changing climate. We find that both drivers determine the realized niches of the studied plants, with land use having a stronger effect than any single climatic variable in the model. Nevertheless, the plants' future distributions appear much more responsive to climate than to land-use changes because alternative future socio-economic backgrounds have only modest impact on land-use decisions in the model region. However, relative effects of climate and land-use changes on biodiversity may differ drastically in other regions, especially where landscapes are still dominated by natural or semi-natural habitat. We conclude that agent-based modelling of land use is able to provide scenarios at scales relevant to individual species distribution and suggest that coupling ABMs with models of species' range change should be intensified to provide more realistic biodiversity forecasts. © 2020 The Authors.

In addition, Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) can effectively reduce engine NOx emissions, and combining EGR technology with GDI engines is becoming a new research direction. In this study, the effects of hydrous ethanol gasoline blends on the combustion and emission characteristics of GDI engines are analyzed through bench test. The results show that the increase of the proportion of hydrous ethanol can accelerate the burning rate, shorten the combustion duration by 7°crank angle (CA), advance the peak moment of in-cylinder pressure and rate of heat release (RoHR) and improve the combustion efficiency. The hydrous ethanol gasoline blends can effectively improve the gaseous and PM emissions of the GDI engine. Among them, the concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) decrease by 10.6% and 12.2%, the concentration of PM drops by three orders of magnitude, and the particle size of the particles is transferred from the accumulation state to the nuclear state. Furthermore, a GT-Power one-dimensional simulation model is established to study the dual effects of EGR technology combined with hydrous ethanol gasoline blends. The results show that the fuel economy is improved under partial load due to the introduction of EGR.

Stromatolite (layered accretions formed by microbial activity) lithification and CaCO3 precipitation are dependent on the interplay between autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial mat communities. Key processes, such as nutrient uptake and primary production by the autotrophic community (cyanobacteria and microalgae) are hypothesised to influence the precipitation process and overall stromatolite growth. As this has yet to be demonstrated, this study investigated primary production, nutrient uptake dynamics (N and P) and CaCO3 precipitation of tufa stromatolites by conducting in situ experiments in a well-studied system near Port Elizabeth, South Africa. There was limited variability between stromatolite pool locations in terms of inorganic content, calcification rates and primary production. Importantly, this demonstrates that these bottom-up processes are likely not solely responsible for observed gradients of stromatolite biomass, as previously thought. This suggests that stromatolite microalgae, when exposed to suitable conditions (i.e. sufficient nutrients and carbonate saturation), are adapted towards an optimum level of accretion to maximise competitive utilisation of these resources. This has important implications for interpreting both modern and past stromatolite growth conditions. Differential stromatolite growth conditions/biomass is likely instead a function of the different durations under which saline, brackish or freshwater (which affect nutrient and carbonate dynamics) are experienced between pool locations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Calcium carbonate precipitation; Nutrient uptake; Primary production; Tufa stromatolite","bioturbation; calcification; calcium carbonate; concentration (composition); heterotrophy; lithification; microbial mat; nutrient uptake; primary production; stromatolite; Eastern Cape; Port Elizabeth; South Africa; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079181613

Allocation of the total emissions reduction target among various entities is an issue of both theoretical importance and practical significance. Based on efficiency analysis, this paper proposes a methodology to develop an iterative procedure that can realize the disaggregation of emissions allowance. We use China as a typical case to illustrate our methodology, and disaggregate China's national reduction target of carbon dioxide emissions into targets applicable at the provincial level. Our results indicate that economically well-developed entities exhibit smaller percentages in carbon reductions. In contrast, less-developed entities should lower their carbon emissions by significant amounts, since their economic growth rates do not align with the huge amounts of ecological consumption. By implementing the proposed allocation scheme, the cross-performance of all involved entities will achieve the best state. The proposed method is readily applicable to general scenarios including nations, industries and enterprises. The results could support decision makers in developing an equitable and easy-to-operate allocation scheme of emissions allowance among various entities. The findings from the case study can be generalized to a global level that economic development and emissions status quos affect the scales of emissions reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions reduction; Data envelopment analysis; Directional distance function; Efficiency","Carbon dioxide; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Economics; Efficiency; Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Iterative methods; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Developing nations; Directional distance function; Economic development; Economic growth rate; Efficiency analysis; Emissions reduction; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076522789

In essence, the abundance of vegetation communities increases the complexity of phenology-climate relationships, leading to a certain limitation in predictions of future dynamics among different vegetation types using a unified model. In this study, we focused on the climatic constraints on spring phenology in arid mountains (AMs) of China, and emphasis was laid on accurate representation of mechanisms that control phenology across different vegetation types. We Firstly explored spatio-temporal variations in satellite-derived estimates of starting date of vegetation growing season (SOS) over the period 2000–2015 using moderate-resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Phenological models in response to climate variability were then established by using mixed-effect models based on satellite observations and an extensive dataset of climatic measurements. Our results showed that the climatic regulation on SOS varied greatly over vegetation types. More climatic factors that regulate phenological development were found in grassland than forest and shrubland. At ecosystem level, two critical climate factors, daily minimum temperature (Tmin) and precipitation, explained 74–95% of total variability in predicted SOS. The observed sensitivity to Tmin is expected to be closely linked with the risk of frost damage, while preseason precipitation determines water availability in spring. The varying ecosystem sensitivity revealed the different resilience and adaptability to changing climate among vegetation types, which have been linked to their eco-physiological characteristics (e.g., water use efficiency) and environmental conditions (e.g., elevation). Overall, our results indicate a strong dependence of spring phenology on Tmin and precipitation, and create an opportunity for a more realistic representation of vegetation phenology and growth of AM plants in China in land surface models. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","arid mountain ecosystems; climate change; daily minimum temperature; NDVI; precipitation; spring phenology","Climate models; Ecosystems; Landforms; Precipitation (chemical); Radiometers; Systems engineering; Vegetation; Eco-physiological characteristics; Environmental conditions; Minimum temperatures; Mountain ecosystems; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; Precipitation controls; Spatio-temporal variation; Climate change; air temperature; arid environment; climate change; mountain environment; NDVI; phenology; precipitation (climatology); spring (season); vegetation type; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074866877

We coupled a flexible chemical kinetics scheme to the Met Office Unified Model, which enables the study of the interaction of chemistry, radiative transfer, and fluid dynamics. We used a newly-released ""reduced"" chemical network, comprising 30 chemical species, that was specifically developed for its application in 3D atmosphere models. We simulated the atmospheres of the well-studied hot Jupiters HD 209458b and HD 189733b which both have dayside-nightside temperature contrasts of several hundred Kelvin and superrotating equatorial jets. We find qualitatively quite different chemical structures between the two planets, particularly for methane (CH4), when advection of chemical species is included. Our results show that consideration of 3D chemical transport is vital in understanding the chemical composition of hot Jupiter atmospheres. Three-dimensional mixing leads to significant changes in the abundances of absorbing gas-phase species compared with what would be expected by assuming local chemical equilibrium, or from models including 1D - and even 2D - chemical mixing. We find that CH4, carbon dioxide (CO2), and ammonia (NH3) are particularly interesting as 3D mixing of these species leads to prominent signatures of out-of-equilibrium chemistry in the transmission and emission spectra, which are detectable with near-future instruments. © ESO 2020.","Planets and satellites: atmospheres; Planets and satellites: composition; Planets and satellites: gaseous planets","Ammonia; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Carbon dioxide; Digital television; Emission spectroscopy; Gas dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Mixing; Chemical compositions; Emission spectrums; Local chemical equilibrium; Out of equilibrium; Radiation hydrodynamics; Temperature contrast; Three dimensional chemicals; Threedimensional (3-d); Three dimensional computer graphics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083846962

During the 11th Five-year Plan, Chinese government set the emission reduction target policy to reduce energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 20%. This paper attempts to estimate the effect of this emission reduction target policy on industrial performance from complexity perspective. The result shows more complex industrial structure is related to less coal consumption. In general, emission reduction target policy has a negative effect on the probability of branching into new industries and lower the productivity and profitability of a given industry. However, this negative effect is weaker for more complex industries. Only for industries with very high complexity, emission reduction target policy can improve the performance of an industry rather than exerting a negative effect.

One of reasons for this phenomenon is the increase in greenhouse gases, especially CO2. Therefore, the authors investigated CO2 absorption from forests of 45 plots in Ba Be National Park, characterized by 3 forest states as rich, medium and poor forest, rehabilitated forest after exploitation to estimate carbon sequestration of the forest. In which, the carbon stock of rich forest reaches 273.17 tones/ha, the medium forest is 136.23 tones/ha and the poor forest, rehabilitated forest is 42.06 tones/ha. With a forest growth rate of 1.8% per year, the carbon sequestration in Ba Be National Park for 3 forest states is about 16,499 tones per year.

In order to assess the economic and environmental consequences of the latter, a mixed linear integer optimization model was developed with the endogenous decision on the potential interconnectors. The case study was carried out for the city of Zagreb, Croatia. The results showed that all three studied interconnections are economically viable, while the socio-economic cost was 29.2% lower in the case of the implemented interconnectors, all other capacities being equal. Moreover, the optimal thermal energy storage capacity was found to be equal to 25 and 24 days of average heating demand in two alternative scenarios.

Tree-based land use system has been emphasized as an effective strategy across ecological regions and farming situations as the most effective farmer-friendly technology limiting GHGs emission. The present study, therefore, was aimed to assess footprint and the annual fluxes of C in different traditional agroforestry systems in contrasting ecosystems to seek a way forward to mitigate climate change. The study revealed higher net C gain in rainfed ecosystem in agricultural system (3925.85 kg CE ha−1) followed by agroforestry systems with trees grown on the boundary (3868.03 kg CE ha−1) followed by trees scattered on farm land (3763.78 kg CE ha−1) and on field bunds (3752.53 kg CE ha−1). However, higher C sustainability index was with scattered planting of trees (30.35) followed by boundary planting (30.31), bund planting (29.54) and agricultural system (26.96). In irrigated ecosystem, higher C gain was in boundary planting of trees (6579.46 kg CE ha−1) followed by silvihorti (6539.96 kg CE ha−1) and bund planting (6051.59 kg CE ha−1), but was the lowest in crops alone (5850.46 kg CE ha−1) and in tree blocks (5121.59 kg CE ha−1). However, higher C sustainability index occurred with block plantation (537.28) followed by boundary planting (40.99), bund planting (37.15), agricultural system (36.56) and silvihorti system (18.58). Further, it was observed that among the inputs used chemical fertilizers contributed more towards GHGs emission in both the ecosystems (76% of the total emission). In the contrasting ecosystems, bund and boundary planting agroforestry systems were more sustainable in terms C efficiency and offered better food security unlike block plantation, and partial substitution of chemical fertilizer helped reduce C emission. Overall, the agroforestry land use systems proved highly sustainable on long-term basis and hence need promotion. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Biomass; Block plantation; C footprint; Climate change; Green house gases","agroforestry; carbon footprint; farming system; food security; intensive agriculture; irrigation system; land use change; rainfed agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067996931

The biome is an agriculture frontier and lost at least 50% of its natural capital since the early 1950s, with the highest rate of vegetation clearing among all Brazilian biomes. Here we match information on geographic range shifts in response to climate changes and habitat loss to define conservation priorities for species genetic diversity using Eugenia dysenterica, a widely distributed tree across the Brazilian Cerrado. We found a set of 27 optimal solutions in which a minimum of 12 out of 23 populations are necessary to represent all 208 alleles of the species. Environmental suitability predicted for 2050 was higher for populations in the southern region of the Cerrado, whereas the proportion of natural remnants around populations expected for 2030 was lower in this same region. Thus, it seems to be more conservative to adopt “in situ” strategies in the northwestern part of the species range to hold more genetic diversity in areas harboring high numbers of natural remnants, despite the likely reduction in climatic suitability. On the other hand, in the southern and southeastern region of the range, despite more stability from a climatic point of view, there was a serious constraint given the high levels of human occupation; in this case, “ex situ” strategies might be a better option for the species. Our results and proposed priorities enable different strategies for making an operational approach for conservation of genetic diversity. Adopting different prioritization strategies for stable and unstable regions (both in climatic suitability and natural remnants) in the future would allow, in principle, to avoid “the worst of both worlds” to achieve an efficient conservation program for the species. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Brazilian Cerrado; Ecological niche modeling; Eugenia dysenterica; Genetic diversity; Irreplaceability","cerrado; climate change; climate effect; conservation planning; dicotyledon; genetic variation; habitat loss; home range; niche; prioritization; range expansion; species conservation; strategic approach; Brazil; Eugenia dysenterica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057094762

However, the current studies are not high in identifying economic output inefficiency and neglect to control target energy carbon emission intensity (ECI), which may cause evaluation bias. Hence, this paper presents a constrained performance index measure (CPIM) model to solve the issues. The proposed model takes the performance index measure and can identify more numbers of positive economic output inefficiency compared to the directional distance function (DDF) model. Besides, the ECI constraint is presented and imposed into the proposed model to restrict the target ECI of decision making units. The numerical example from China's provincial dataset demonstrates and confirms the validity and merit of the proposed model through the measure and constraint comparison among different models. Then, it is found that most provinces exist certain economic output inefficiency and the center regions have a worst score of energy carbon emission performance index due to the rapid development of their secondary industry by using the proposed model. Several valuable modeling directions and questions related to performance index measure and energy pollution emission constraints are provided for future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission performance index; Constrained performance index measure; Energy performance index","Decision making; Energy utilization; Carbon emission intensities; Carbon emissions; Decision making unit; Directional distance function; Economic output; Energy performance indices; Performance indices; Pollution emissions; Carbon; carbon emission; decision making; economic conditions; environmental protection; index method; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081029063

The work performed in this manuscript focuses on the investigation of bacteria trapping and killing efficiency of stainless steel grids coated with a mixed layer of Cu-Ag. These grids are to be employed as decontamination filters for a smart natural ventilation prototype that we are currently building in our laboratory. The tested grids were coated with a mixed Cu-Ag layer using thermionic vacuum arc plasma processing technology. The fixed deposition geometry allowed the variation of Cu and Ag atomic concentration in coated layers as a function of substrate position in relation to plasma sources. The test conducted with air contaminated with a pathogen strain of staphylococcus aureus indicated that the filtering efficiency is influenced by two parameters: the pore size dimension and the coating layer composition. The results show that the highest filtering efficiency of 100% was obtained for fine pore (0.5 ± 0.5 mm) grids coated with a mixed metallic layer composed of 65 at% Cu and 35 at% Ag. The second test performed only on reference grids and Cu-Ag (65-35 at%) under working conditions, confirm a similar filtering efficiency for the relevant microbiological markers. This particular sample was investigated from morphological, structural, and compositional point of view. The results show that the layer has a high surface roughness with good wear resistance and adhesion to the substrate. The depth profiles presented a uniform composition of Cu and Ag in the layer with small variations caused by changes in deposition rates during the coating process. Identification of the two metallic phases of the Cu and Ag in the layers evidences their crystalline nature. The calculated grain size of the nanocrystalline was in the range 14-21 nm. © 2020 by the authors.","Air filtering; Antibacterial efficiency; Bacteria; Coated grids; Cu-Ag layers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083860811

The paraffinic fuel used was the HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) produced by Neste Oil with the brand name NEXBTL. The study was conducted on a light-duty turbocharged and aftercooled common-rail diesel engine, with both HVO and a conventional diesel fuel. Four steady-state operating points were examined, at low and medium engine speeds (1500 and 3000 rpm) and loads (35 and 100 Nm), typical of daily driving of a passenger car. The key contribution of the study is a comprehensive analysis of the phenomena influencing the crank angle resolved in-cylinder parameters, as well as interlinking the effects of different variations of injection pressure (default and 300 bar higher), pilot injection timing (default and ± 5°CA) and main injection timing (default and ± 2°CA) on gaseous emissions and particulate matter (PM). The findings have shown that at default engine settings the use of HVO results in up to 40% reduction of engine-out PM and HC emissions without appreciable changes in NOx emissions. The significant reduction of engine-out PM levels, facilitates the adoption of measures for NOx emissions limitation. The latter are reduced by up to 20% when the main injection timing is retarded (by 2° CA in the present study), while PM emissions are still kept well below the respective diesel fuel levels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","HVO; Injection pressure; Main injection timing; Pilot injection timing; PM-NOx trade off; Renewable diesel","Diesel fuels; Economic and social effects; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Passenger cars; Injection pressures; Injection timing; Pilot injection timing; Renewable diesels; Trade off; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077091033

Therefore, unfavourable environmental and climatic conditions render them more vulnerable to increasing food insecurity and poverty rates. However, few studies have investigated how farmers’ adaptation strategies affect farm productivity and household food security in the Sahelian region, notably Mali. We analyse factors that influence adaptation strategies to climate change and the impacts of the adaptation strategies on maize productivity and household food security in southern Mali. Farmers use adaptation strategies such as organic fertilizers, changing planting dates and growing of short duration maize varieties to mitigate against the negative effects of climate change. We find that farmer experience, number of livestock owned, off-farm employment, access to credit, farmer association and technical training exert positive effects on the use of planting short-duration maize varieties as an adaptation strategy, while distance to the farm shows a negative effect. We observe that household size, experience in maize farming, number of livestock owned and technical training positively influence farmers to change planting dates as an adaptation strategy. The use of organic fertilizers and short-duration maize varieties promote maize productivity and food security. We conclude that building farmers’ adaptive capacity tends to reduce their vulnerability to climate change by increasing crop yields and food security. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation strategies; Climate change; Environmental change; Food security; Maize yield; Mali","Agricultural robots; Cultivation; Fertilizers; Food supply; Industrial management; Productivity; Technical presentations; Adaptation strategies; Adaptive capacity; Climate change adaptation; Climatic conditions; Maize productivity; Off-farm employment; Organic fertilizers; Technical training; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; crop production; crop yield; food security; livelihood; maize; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; Mali; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082840799

The effect of common agro-waste management practices in soil quality and agricultural production system over this part of the world is not well documented. In the present three-years long study, spanning over two entirely different agro-ecological zones of India and Bhutan, highlights the impacts of the burning of agricultural waste in soil physio-chemical properties, biological properties and crop production. The current study also focuses on the alternative usage of crop residue to enhance soil organic carbon, soil moisture, soil nutrients and soil biological activity through the application of biochar and raw agricultural waste generated from the field. It was observed that crop residue used as raw mulch and biochar improved the agricultural production up to 36%–64% over the experimental fields of India and Bhutan. The results from the study disseminated among the local farmers and technological support were provided for practicing alternative crop residue management. Nearly 1450–1500 farmers in India and 100–125 farmers in Bhutan have adopted the agro-waste management practices of removal and re-application of agro-wastes in the field.

It is also home to subsiding organic soils, decreasing native aquatic species populations, water quality degradation, vulnerable levees (levees are equivalent to dikes) and decreasing agricultural viability. There has been substantial progress in the interdisciplinary understanding and quantification of the nature and effects of subsidence and its mitigation. Because of the need for a drained rootzone, farming of crops such as vegetables, trees, vines, corn and alfalfa, results in an ongoing unsustainable cycle of continuing peat oxidation and deepening of drainage ditches to compensate for elevation loss. Despite substantial evidence for the increasing risks to the State's economy and water supply, the unsustainability of the status quo, and evidence for the benefits of alternatives, there has been limited progress in converting to land uses that can reduce, stop and reverse subsidence. Our overall approach has been to measure land-surface elevation changes; understand, quantify and model subsidence and greenhouse gas emissions from drained organic soil, and evaluate alternate land uses. Subsidence rates vary from less than 0.5 to over 2 cm yr-1, depending primarily on depth to groundwater and soil organic matter content. The primary cause of subsidence is the oxidation of organic matter, which has resulted in elevations of -3 to -9m on about 100 000 ha. Using the results from micrometeorological measurements and modelling, we estimate that organic-matter oxidation causes an annual emission of over 2-106 t of CO2-equivalent which represents about 21% of the State's plant-based agricultural emissions. Rewetting of the peat soils is emerging as a viable solution. Rice and wetlands stop and (in the case of wetlands) reverse the effects of subsidence and result in a net greenhouse-gas emission reduction benefit. Wetlands accrete about 3 cm of soil per year, can break the unsustainable subsidence/drainage cycle, reverse the trajectory of increasing hydraulic pressures on levees, reduce the probability of levee failure and seepage onto islands (islands are equivalent to polders), and may provide material for biofuels and animal feed. The recent implementation of a methodology for quantification of the GHG benefit is facilitating land use conversion and participation in the carbon market. © Author(s) 2020.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biogeochemistry; Economics; Embankments; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Land use; Levees; Organic compounds; Oxidation; Peat; Soils; Water quality; Water supply; Water supply systems; Wetlands; Agricultural emissions; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Hydraulic pressure; Micrometeorological measurements; Organic matter oxidation; Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta; Soil organic matter contents; Water quality degradation; Subsidence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105612107

The population was the natives of Mukti Jaya village, Rimba Melintang, Rokan Hilir Municipality, Riau. There is an increase in the amount of methane emission from agricultural activities in Mukti Jaya village, Rimba Melintang, Rokan Hilir municipality, Riau between 2011 and 2015. However, the amount of methane emission in the village is low because of the agricultural mitigation the farmers conducted. The farmers selected low emission rice variety and applied organic fertilizer. Previous researchers have conducted various studies on methane emission and greenhouse gas emissionin agricultural sector. However, none of the studies discusses methane emission produced by agricultural sector in the villages considered as Kampung Iklim. The topic is important in order to provide an overview about methane emission reduction in agricultural sector.

The engine architecture is a supercharged high-power output, 1.1-liter engine with two-firing cylinders and a high compression ratio of 13.5: 1. The integrated exhaust heat recovery system is an additional, larger displacement, non-fueled cylinder into which the exhaust gas from the two firing cylinders is alternately transferred to be further expanded. The main goal of this work is to implement in this engine, advanced lean/dilute low-temperature combustion for low-NOx and high efficiency operation, and to address the transition between the different operating modes. Those include well-mixed charge compression-ignition at low-load, and a mixed-mode combustion at higher loads, before transitioning to boosted homogenous and stochiometric spark-ignited combustion. Here, the mixed-mode combustion strategy is composed of a deflagration of a stratified mixture created by a late direct injection, then triggering a controlled autoignition of the surrounding gas, improving the robustness of lean/dilute combustion. The paper describes the key features of the engine and details regarding the combustion and multi-mode valve strategies. The experiments were performed under steady-state operation at 2000 rpm, from 1 to 11 bar IMEPn and naturally aspirated conditions. The engine demonstrated great efficiency gains compared to a conventional naturally-aspirated and downsized-boosted spark-ignited engines. The piston-compounding exhaust-heat recovery system contributes to up to 10% of the total efficiency improvement, while lean/dilute advanced combustion increases the fuel economy by up to 38% compared to a naturally aspirated engine, and up to 22%, compared to a downsized-boosted engine. NOx emissions target was met using high-levels of internal and external dilution in mixed-mode combustion operation, as well as by optimizing the injection and ignition strategy. Finally, the analysis shows that a seamless transition between the different valving strategies is achievable in support of robust transient operation. © 2020 General Motors.",,"Direct injection; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuel economy; Gases; Heat pump systems; Ignition; Nitrogen oxides; Temperature; Waste heat; Controlled autoignition; Exhaust heat recovery system; High compression ratio; High-efficiency operations; Low temperature combustion; Naturally aspirated engine; Spark ignited combustion; Steady-state operation; Compression ratio (machinery)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083836775

We developed a semi-quantitative method, based on the degree of openness and Anthropogenic Impact Factors (AIF scores) from palaeoecological data (mire and lake records). Archaeological information was also considered to evaluate human impact. We compared regional mire development trends with datasets from Northern Europe, Siberia, Alaska and Canada, and with global CH4 emission. Heterogenous cases of mire initiation were highlighted during the last 15 ka years in the EMFC. From 15 to 11.7 ka cal. BP, some mires and histic horizons occurred, although further research is needed to better understand these peat accumulation phases. Related to the Early Holocene warming, a mire generation established by terrestrialization, in the southern EFMC where geomorphology favoured fens. Bogs also formed by paludification in the whole area between 10 and 7 ka cal. BP. Then, various cases of mire initiation were found from 4.4 to 2.4 ka cal. BP. The high number of mires established since 2.4 ka cal. BP could be related to major anthropogenic changes, indirectly favouring fens (in former ponds for instance) or small bogs (at the back of roads, walls or in abandoned drainage systems). This last generation was typical of Western European mountains and implied that moderate human impact may also produce socio-ecosystems with high ecological values. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate changes; Human impact; Peat initiation; Radiocarbon dataset; Spatio-temporal distribution of mires; Vegetation dynamic synthesis","Climate change; Ecosystems; Wetlands; Anthropogenic changes; Anthropogenic impacts; Human impact; Integrated approach; Quantitative method; Radiocarbon dataset; Spatiotemporal distributions; Vegetation dynamics; Peat; anthropogenic effect; archaeological evidence; fen; geomorphology; Holocene; integrated approach; mire; paleoecology; peat soil; radiocarbon dating; trend analysis; Alaska; France; Massif Central; Northern Europe; Siberia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080023364

Specifically, WC and 50:50 wt% TiC:WC solid solution powders were exposed to flowing hydrogen gas, or equilibrated against an excess of titanium in the presence of iodine, to form metallic tungsten and TiC solid products. In the case of pure WC reacting with hydrogen, transformation to metallic tungsten occurred as a result of removal of chemically bound carbon as gaseous hydrocarbons. In the case of pure WC reacting with titanium iodide vapors, transformation was accompanied by the appearance of TiC as a solid product formed at the gas-solid interface. In the case of 50:50 wt% TiC:WC solid solution powders, hydrogen was generally found to be an ineffective displacing reagent, whereas reaction with titanium iodide vapors was observed to proceed virtually to completion, resulting in a two phase product mixture comprising metallic tungsten and TiC. For the latter case, a variety of microstructures could be observed within a given batch, including tungsten platelets and/or lamellae in a TiC matrix, or coarse tungsten grains interspersed with TiC grains. These morphological variations are speculated to arise from compositional variation in the starting material and the occurrence of local rapid coarsening along fast diffusion pathways within reacting agglomerates and polycrystalline primary particles. The observed reaction products and relative efficacy of gaseous reagents to promote displacement reactions in the Ti–W–C system are rationalized on the basis of thermodynamic predictions.

A multiscale energy system engineering approach is followed combining process synthesis, scheduling, and supply chain concepts to address the trade-offs between various technologies in renewable power generation and storage, as well as energy carrier production and transportation across different locations. We apply our strategy to analyze the integration of hydrogen-based dense energy carriers (DECs) produced in a high-potential region of renewable energy in Texas in tandem with local solar production and battery storage in a low-potential region in New York to minimize the levelized cost of renewable electricity.

The “4 per 1,000 Initiative: Soils for food security and climate” was launched in 2015 to increase soil organic carbon sequestration with three objectives: mitigation of climate change, adaptation to climate change and improved food security. One of the challenges of the Initiative relates to its feasibility in contrasted biophysical, social and economic environments, questioning the adoption rate of required new practices. We conducted participatory multi-stakeholder workshops in France and Senegal to collect knowledge and perception of farmers, NGOs, agro-industries, administrations, donors and researchers on barriers and coping strategies for 4 per 1,000 innovations. Results in both countries reveal the predominance of social and economic barriers such as lack of knowledge or training, increased difficulties of fieldwork, workload, risk handling, funding and social pressure. Biophysical constraints such as limited potential of soil organic matter storage or rainfall scarcity and variability appear more important in Senegal. Identified actions to foster the sequestration of soil carbon call for an improved policy context leading to innovations in land planning, stakeholder communication, demonstration facilities, capacity building or financial support. Fewer constraints and coping strategies mention technical issues, showing that fostering agricultural soil carbon sequestration is more a question of enabling environment than technical innovations or farmers' willingness for change.

Given the value of the polymer products—polycarbonates or polyether carbonates—it could provide an economic stimulus to capture and storage technologies. The process efficiency depends upon the catalyst, and previously Zn(ii)Mg(ii) heterodinuclear catalysts showed good performances at low carbon dioxide pressures, attributed to synergic interactions between the metals. Now, a Mg(ii)Co(ii) catalyst is reported that exhibits significantly better activity (turnover frequency &gt; 12,000 h−1) and high selectivity (&gt;99% CO2 utilization and polycarbonate selectivity) for carbon dioxide and cyclohexene oxide copolymerization. Detailed kinetic investigations show a second-order rate law, independent of CO2 pressure from 1–40 bar, to produce polyols. Kinetic data also reveal that synergy arises from differentiated roles for the metals in the mechanism: epoxide coordination occurs at Mg(ii), with reduced transition state entropy, while the Co(ii) centre accelerates carbonate attack by lowering the transition state enthalpy. This rare insight into intermetallic synergy rationalizes the outstanding catalytic performance and provides a new feature to exploit in other homogeneous catalyses.

WFS was calcined at 600–900 °C, referred to as calcined foundry sand (CFS). Self-compacting mortars were produced with cement replacement levels of 0–30 vol% with CFS and a limestone filler. WFS and CFS were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The fresh-state properties (mini slump flow and mini V-funnel), cement hydration (isothermal calorimetry and XRD), compressive strength and microstructure (SEM-EDS) of the mortars were evaluated. EDS showed that WFS calcination reduced its carbon content and XRD indicated the loss of the montmorillonite crystalline structure present in the clay material. CFS-containing mortars required superplasticizer contents from 2% to 10% higher than the reference to reach the target flow range (240–260 mm), while increased the mini V-funnel from 4.9 (reference) to 10.3 s (30% CFS). Nonetheless, all the mortars met EFNARC's requirements. Calorimetry and XRD indicated that CFS enhanced the early age hydration of cement, increasing the main heat flow peak from 6.85 to 7.81 mW/g of cement and 72-h cumulative heat from 407 to 462 J/g of cement compared to limestone, with higher calcium hydroxide and lower alite contents at 3 days. CFS-containing mortars showed strength values about 14% higher than those containing limestone, for the same replacement level and age. Cement replacement with 10% CFS resulted in strengths equivalent to those of the reference mix at all ages (about 39, 45 and 54 MPa, respectively at 3, 7 and 28 days). SEM-EDS showed no significant differences between the microstructure of the mortars containing CFS and limestone. Overall, 10% CFS incorporation reduced 76 kg of cement and incorporated 58 kg of WFS per m³ of mortar, with equivalent performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-friendly construction; Industrial waste; Self-compacting mortar; Supplementary cementitious material; Waste foundry sand; Waste reuse","Calcination; Calorimeters; Calorimetry; Cements; Compressive strength; Fillers; Foundries; Hydrated lime; Hydration; Industrial wastes; Lime; Limestone; Microstructure; Mortar; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermogravimetric analysis; X ray diffraction; Eco-friendly construction; Self-compacting mortars; Supplementary cementitious material; Waste foundry sands; Waste reuse; Foundry sand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078757123

Specifically, we present the co-recurrence ratio (α), which elucidates the dependence structure between variables by quantifying their joint recurrences. This approach is applied to daily climate extremes, derived from the ERA-Interim reanalysis over the 1979–2018 period. The analysis focuses on concurrent (i.e., same-day) wet (total precipitation) and windy (10 m wind gusts) extremes in Europe and concurrent cold (2 m temperature) extremes in Eastern North America and wet extremes in Europe. Results for wet and windy extremes in Europe, which we use as a test-bed for our methodology, show that α peaks during boreal winter. High α values correspond to wet and windy extremes in northwestern Europe, and to large-scale conditions resembling the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This confirms earlier findings which link the positive NAO to a heightened frequency of extratropical cyclones impacting northwestern Europe. For the Eastern North America–Europe case, α extremes once again reflect concurrent climate extremes – in this case cold extremes over North America and wet extremes over Europe. Our analysis provides detailed spatial information on regional hotspots for these compound extreme occurrences, and encapsulates information on their spatial footprint which is typically not included in a conventional co-occurrence analysis. We conclude that α successfully characterises compound extremes by reflecting the evolution of the associated meteorological maps. This approach is entirely general, and may be applied to different types of compound extremes and geographical regions. © 2020 The Authors.

Vegetative and reproductive phenophases of 50 tree-shrub species were monitored monthly (12 months), and their relationship with climatic variables was tested using multiple linear regression. Time of leaf budding differed between areas for autochoric species and between autochoric and anemochoric species at LDF. Leaf fall in communities and functional groups was seasonal and highly synchronous during the dry season (95 % of species). Leaf budding peaked at the end of the dry season with > 80 % synchrony. In general, the species presented low synchrony or asynchrony for flowering phenophases, while fruiting phenophases were weakly seasonal but differed between functional groups. Temperature and precipitation were the regulating factors of vegetative phenophases in LDF, while daylength regulated them in SDF. Abiotic factors only influenced flowering phenophases at the dispersion group level. Only ripe fruits were related to reduced daylength. The phenophases of the deciduous forests of the Pantanal seem to be regulated not only by climatic factors but also by strong endogenous control. © 2020, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

There is a charge transfer from boron to nitrogen atoms which increases with the doping level. This transfer does not involve carbon atoms. Combined doping reduces both the ionization potentials (IPs) and the electron affinities (EAs) of the NFs similar to nitrogen doping alone. Boron does not affect either IPs or EAs being neither n- nor p-type dopant for the isomeric graphene NFs. All hybrid NFs show a tendency to increase the band gaps with doping level, which is promoted by the increment of the bond length alternation with doping.

Evidence-based decision making for the progressive control of the disease requires spatially-explicit information on its occurrence and prevalence, as well as on the distribution and abundance of the tsetse vector. In the framework of the continental Atlas of tsetse and African animal trypanosomosis (AAT), a geo-referenced database was assembled for Nigeria, based on the systematic review of 133 scientific publications (period January 1990 - March 2019). The three main species of trypanosomes responsible for the disease (i.e. Trypanosoma vivax, T. congolense and T. brucei) were found to be widespread, thus posing a national-level problem. Their geographic distribution extends beyond the tsetse-infested belt, owing to the combined effect of animal movement and mechanical transmission by non-tsetse vectors. T. simiae, the major trypanosomal pathogen in pigs, T. godfreyi and the human-infective T. brucei gambiense were also reported. AAT was reported in a number of susceptible host species, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, camels, horses, donkeys and dogs, while no study on wildlife was identified. Estimates of prevalence are heavily influenced by the sensitivity of the diagnostic techniques, ranging from an average of 3.5% for blood films to 31.0% for molecular techniques. Two riverine tsetse species (i.e. Glossina palpalis palpalis and G. tachinoides) were found to have the broadest geographical range, as they were detected in all six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. By contrast, the distribution of savannah species (i.e. G. morsitans submorsitans and G. longipalpis) appears to be highly fragmented, and limited to protected areas. Very little information is available for forest species, with one single paper reporting on G. fusca congolensis and G. nigrofusca nigrofusca in the Niger Delta region. The future development of a national Atlas of tsetse and AAT, relying on both published and unpublished information, could improve on the present review and provide further epidemiological evidence for decision making. © 2020 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)","GIS; Neglected tropical diseases; Nigeria; Trypanosomosis; Tsetse","abundance; epidemiology; geographical distribution; GIS; health risk; public health; satellite data; satellite imagery; tsetse fly; Article; blood analysis; bovine; camel; dog; domestic animal; donkey; evidence based practice; geographic distribution; geographic information system; Glossina; Glossina palpalis palpalis; Glossina tachinoides; Glossinidae; goat; horse; host susceptibility; molecular diagnosis; nagana; neglected disease; Nigeria; nonhuman; parasite transmission; parasite vector; pig; prevalence; sheep; Trypanosoma; Trypanosoma brucei; Trypanosoma brucei gambiense; Trypanosoma congolense; Trypanosoma godfreyi; Trypanosoma simiae; Trypanosoma vivax; African trypanosomiasis; animal; classification; Glossinidae; livestock; physiology; veterinary medicine; wild animal; Nigeria; Animalia; Bos; Camelidae; Canis familiaris; Capra hircus; Equidae; Glossina palpalis palpalis; Ovis aries; Suidae; Trypanosoma brucei; Trypanosoma vivax; Animals; Animals, Wild; Livestock; Nigeria; Trypanosoma; Trypanosomiasis, African; Tsetse Flies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079156462

Biochar is simply carbon rich charcoal-like substance which is created by heating biomass (organic matter) in limited oxygen condition, through a process known as pyrolysis. Locally available weed biomass which is not economically important and caused crop loss can be used as an important source of biomass for preparation of biochar. Biochar is able to ameliorate soil acidity as well as it is also able to increase the soil fertility. Biochar reduces leaching of soil nutrients, increases soil structure and pH, reduces dependency on artificial fertilizers, enhances nutrient availability for plants, increases water quality of runoff, reduces toxicity of aluminum to plant roots and microbiota and thus reducing the need for lime, reduces bioavailability of heavy metals, thus works as bioremediation and decreases N2O and CH4 emissions from soils, thus further reducing GHG emissions. Employment of biochar as a specialized soil amendment provides a practical approach to address the anticipated problems in the agronomic and environmental sectors. Incorporating huge quantity of biochar into soils provides numerous agricultural benefits, which this special paper examines. But, there is no concrete compilation yet how to apply biochar at farm level. This paper discusses on several factors related to biochar that need to be considered for maximising the soil amelioration and soil quality benefits from the use of biochar. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Amendment; Biochar; Charcoal; GHG emissions; Soil nutrients",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087424502

Winter had the most stable meteorological conditions, thus most RPHPDs appeared in winter, followed by autumn and summer, with the least days in spring. RPHPDs were classified into three patterns, respectively, as equalized pressure (EQP), advancing edge of a cold front (ACF) and inverted trough of low pressure (INT) according to the SLP (sea level pressure). RPHPDs under EQP were the most (51%), followed by ACF (37%); INT was the minimum (12%). Using statistical methods and meteorological condition data on RPHPDs from 2013 to 2017 to deduce the thresholds and 2018 as an independent dataset to validate the proposed thresholds, the threshold values of meteorological elements are summarized as follows. The probability of RPHPDs without rain was above 92% with the daily and hourly precipitation of all RPHPDs below 2.1 mm and 0.8 mm. Wind speed, RHs, inversion intensity(ITI), height difference in the temperature inversion(ITK), the lower height of temperature inversion (LHTI) and mixed-layer height (MLH) in terms of 25%–75% high probability range were respectively within 0.5–3.6 m s−1, 55%–92%, 0.7–4.0 ◦C 100 m −1, 42–576 m, 3–570 m, 200–1200 m. Two conditions should be considered: Whether the pattern was EQP, ACF or INT and whether the eight meteorological elements are within the thresholds. If both criteria are met, PM2.5 particles tend to accumulate and air pollution diffusion conditions are poor. Unfavorable meteorological conditions are the necessary, but not sufficient condition for RPHPDs. © 2020, MDPI AG.

Environmental and economic analysis model is established to study the system feasibility and performance, and eight typical Chinese cities are selected as the evaluated scenarios. The annual primary energy consumption (PEC) can be considerably reduced by introducing DMS to CO2 system, which is up to 8.65, 15.66, and 55.41% in comparison with baseline (BASE) CO2 system, coal-fired boiler (CFB) + traditional air conditioner (TAC), and direct electric heating (DEH) + TAC system, respectively. The PEC is higher for the severe cold and the cold region, and it is the lowest when small temperature difference fan-coil unit (STD-FCU) is utilized as heating/cooling terminal. The PEC can be reduced by 47.90% when the energy-saving potential for the building envelope is 65%. The gaseous and solid particulate matter emissions can also be significantly decreased by 3.80–9.75% in comparison with BASE CO2 system. The life cycle cost (LCC) performance is improved, and a lowest levelized annual total revenue requirement (TRRL) of 7924.93 CNY is obtained when DMS CO2 system with STD-FCU is used in Guangzhou, which is 4.51–14.04% lower compared with BASE system. CO2 compressor and electricity price have significant impact on the LCC and payback period. DMS CO2 system is a promising solution for annual space heating and cooling with the help of feed-in tariff and CO2 compressor price reduction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy-saving; CO2; Dedicated mechanical subcooling; Environment and economic analysis; Residential heating and cooling","Air conditioning; Carbon dioxide; Coal fired boilers; Coal industry; Cooling; Electric heating; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Housing; Investments; Life cycle; Space heating; Building energy saving; Economic feasibility analysis; Energy saving potential; Life cycle costs (LCC); Primary energy consumption; Residential heating; Subcoolings; Temperature differences; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082191205

A common residential building is selected as a scenario to assess the system annual performance from the viewpoint of energetic, exergetic, and exergoeconomic, and compare with traditional CO2 system (BASE). The influences of terminal type, climate condition, and energy-saving potential are discussed. The results indicate the annual performance factor (APF) of CO2 system is significantly improved by up to 6.23 ~ 22.90%. APF generally increases with the latitude, and it achieves the highest value of 3.41 by using small temperature difference fan-coil unit (STD-FCU) as terminal. The annual exergy efficiency (AEE) is promoted by 7.25 ~ 24.79%, and the throttling irreversibility can be significantly reduced by adopting DMS. From the perspective of thermoeconomic, introducing DMS to CO2 system is cost effective. The total cost, including non-exergy-related investment and cost of exergy destruction, is reduced by 16.96% for heating and 4.52% for cooling. The annual exergoeconomic factor increases with the improvement of building energy-saving potential while decreases with the compressor price reduction. To widen the application of CO2 system, it is suggested that the price of CO2 compressor should be reduced, such as with the help of government subsidies. Furthermore, the thermal insulation performance of the residential building should also be improved, especially for the severe cold and cold regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Annual heating and cooling; CO2; Dedicated mechanical subcooling; Energetic and exergetic analysis; Exergoeconomic analysis; Reversible heat pump-air conditioning","Air conditioning; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Exergy; Heat pump systems; Heating; Housing; Investments; Thermal insulation; Energetic and exergetic analysis; Exergoeconomic analysis; Heating and cooling; Reversible heat pumps; Subcoolings; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080039648

Purposely manipulating the root-associated AMF assemblages in order to improve plant health and modulate their interaction with the rhizosphere microbes could lead to increased agricultural crop yields and phytoremediation performance by the host plant and its root-associated microbiota. In this study, we tested whether repeated inoculations with a Proteobacteria consortium influenced plant productivity and the AMF assemblages associated with the root and rhizosphere of four plant species growing either in non-contaminated natural soil or in sediments contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. A mesocosm experiment was performed in a randomized complete block design in four blocks with two factors: (1) substrate contamination (contaminated or not contaminated), and (2) inoculation (or not) with a bacterial consortium composed of ten isolates of Proteobacteria. Plants were grown in a greenhouse over four months, after which the effect of treatments on plant biomass and petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations in the substrate were determined. MiSeq amplicon sequencing, targeting the 18S rRNA gene, was used to assess AMF community structures in the roots and rhizosphere of plants growing in both contaminated and non-contaminated substrates. We also investigated the contribution of plant identity and biotope (plant roots and rhizospheric soil) in shaping the associated AMF assemblages. Our results showed that while inoculation caused a significant shift in AMF communities, the substrate contamination had a much stronger influence on their structure, followed by the biotope and plant identity to a lesser extent. Moreover, inoculation significantly increased plant biomass production and was associated with a decreased petroleum hydrocarbons dissipation in the contaminated soil. The outcome of this study provides knowledge on the factors influencing the diversity and community structure of AMF associated with indigenous plants following repeated inoculation of a bacterial consortium. It highlights the dominance of soil chemical properties, such as petroleum hydrocarbon presence, over biotic factors and inputs, such as plant species and microbial inoculations, in determining the plant-associated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities. © 2020 by the authors.","Amplicon sequencing; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Bacterial inoculation; Biodiversity; Microbial ecology; Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination; Plant-microbes interactions; Rhizosphere microbiome; Ribosomal RNA",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084001541

This study describes a design proposal for a premium passive refugee house that uses three main passive heating and cooling solutions (Earth Air Heat Exchanger, Trombe wall, and green wall) and is suited to the Swedish climate. The purpose of the combination of the three passive systems is to reduce cooling and heating loads to conserve a significant amount of primary energy and thus mitigate the impact of the house's energy use on the environment through a reduction in emissions. The house is designed to fulfill its energy needs from renewable sources and produce an annual surplus of 180 kWh/m2/annum. The methodology applied is a dynamic system modeling and simulation approach using TRNSYS and ANSYS software. The simulation results showed a heating load of 7.9 kWh/m2/annum and a cooling load of 2.8 kWh/m2/annum, with total energy consumption reaching 18.4 kWh/m2/annum. Preliminary feasibility costing showed a payback time of 7.4 years out of the 25-years suggested lifetime of building using the three passive solutions. The amount of CO2 emissions is 231.1 kg CO2e/annum with a primary energy demand of 0.032 GJ/m2/annum. As a follow-up to the initial study, a proof of concept has been implemented in Lund, Sweden, in an urban living lab to verify the simulation results through a 12-month post-occupancy monitoring and evaluation study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CFD simulation; EAHE; Green wall; Premium passive house; Refugee housing; Trombe wall","Computer software; Cooling systems; Earth (planet); Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Heat exchangers; Houses; Walls (structural partitions); CFD simulations; EAHE; Green wall; Passive house; Trombe wall; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081006362

The irregular precipitation makes hydroponics a recommended technique for these regions, since it demands less water compared to conventional cropping systems. Two experiments, one from May to June 2016 (autumn) and other from March to April 2017 (summer-autumn), were conducted in a hydroponic system in PVC tubes, using the Deep Flow Technique (DFT). A 2 × 3 × 2 factorial arrangement in split-plot was used, which consisted of two nutrient solution depths (0.02 and 0.03 m) and three recirculation intervals of the nutrient solution (0.25, 12 and 24 h), with two coriander cultivars ('Tabocas' and 'Verdao') in the sub-plots, which were cultivated in the same hydroponic channel. Plant height, shoot fresh and dry matters, water consumption, water use efficiency and visual quality of the coriander plants were evaluated. The coriander cv. 'Verdao' was more tolerant to climatic variations, especially when plants were grown in channels with nutrient solution depth of 0.02 m and recirculation interval of 0.25 h, presenting higher growth and production. The recirculation intervals of 12 and 24 h had a negative effect on the variables evaluated; though, this effect was more significant in the summer-autumn experiment, affecting the quality of the plants harvested, especially those of the cv. 'Tabocas'. It may be concluded that the cultivation of the coriander in the DFT system in PVC tubes is viable, especially in sites with insecure electricity supply. © 2020, United Arab Emirates University.","Coriandrum sativum L.; Dissolved oxygen; Hydroponics; Water resources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085469102

These collective characteristics are essential in creating high-efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion and fuel generation in metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Recent years have witnessed considerable advances in rational design and controllable fabricate of COF-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, and CO2 reduction reactions. In this review, engineering strategies of COFs toward electrocatalysts are first summarized and given particular attention, highlighting their influence on intrinsic electrocatalytic performance. A systematic overview of the fundamental principles behind specific electrocatalysis reactions is then performed. Significant breakthroughs of COFs and their derivatives are presented in detail with an emphasis on the relationship between the molecular structures of COFs and their electrocatalytic performance. Lastly, current challenges and future perspectives on tailoring COFs for high-performance electrocatalysts are discussed.

Higher DIN fluxes were recorded in spring and summer and their total fluxes (averaged 7.58 kg N ha−1) were similar to the critical loads in aquatic ecosystems. Significant differences of precipitation δ15N were observed for NH4 +-N between town and wetland sites in spring and between urban and rural sites in summer. For NO3 −-N, significant differences of precipitation δ15N were observed between town and rural sites in spring and between urban and town sites in autumn, respectively. Quantitative results of NO3 −-N sources showed that both biomass burning and coal combustion had higher fluxes at the urban site especially in winter (0.18 ± 0.09 and 0.19 ± 0.08 kg N ha−1), which were about three times higher than those at the town site. A similar finding was observed for soil emission and vehicle exhausts in winter. On the whole, DIN wet deposition averaged at 12.13 kg N ha−1 yr−1 with the urban site as the hotspot (17.50 kg N ha−1 yr−1) and regional NO3 −-N fluxes had a seasonal pattern with minimum values in winter. The contribution to NO3 −-N wet deposition from biomass burning was 26.1 ± 14.1%, which is the second dominant factor lower than coal combustion (26.5 ± 12.6%) in the TGR area during spring and summer. Hence N emission reduction from biomass burning, coal combustion and vehicle exhausts should be strengthened especially in spring and summer to effectively manage DIN pollution for the sustainable development in TGR area. © 2020","Inorganic nitrogen; Nitrogen isotope; Source apportionment; Three Gorges reservoir (TGR); Wet deposition","ammonia; coal; dissolved inorganic nitrogen; nitrate; nitrogen derivative; unclassified drug; ammonium derivative; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; rain; ammonium; concentration (composition); dissolved inorganic nitrogen; land use; nitrate; nitrogen isotope; precipitation quality; seasonal variation; source apportionment; wet deposition; aquatic environment; Article; autumn; biomass; China; combustion; controlled study; exhaust gas; land use; precipitation; seasonal variation; soil pollution; spring; summer; urban rural difference; wet deposition; wetland; winter; ecosystem; environment; environmental monitoring; pollutant; season; soil; China; Three Gorges Reservoir; Ammonium Compounds; Biomass; China; Coal; Ecosystem; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Rain; Seasons; Soil; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079689776

We assemble a unique firm-level dataset with both firms’ patent innovation in renewable energy and CDM projects accounted for. We obtain some novel findings. CDM projects have contributed to the firm-level innovation in renewable energy and energy efficiency. The heterogeneity is detected. This positive enhancement effect is pronounced in invention patents, but is muted in utility patents. The induced innovation effect varies across industrial energy intensity. The more energy intensive the industry, the larger impacts the firms could absorb from the CDM projects. When inspecting CDM by specific energy type, the type-specific induced innovation effect is only documented for biofuel-related CDM projects, indicating that firm-level innovation in biofuels appears to benefit from the related CDM projects within the same province.

Climate change is an increasingly complex challenge for these territories. Tackling climate change, moreover, in a sustainable way, is a priority in the European Union, which has set several ambitious short-and long-term mitigation, adaptation, and sustainability targets. It is a central issue of how society can respond to the climate emergency that is affected by and depends on the vertical and horizontal interrelations among different stakeholders, organizations, governance actors, etc., and their activities. Countries, regions, counties, and cities around the world react by developing climate strategies. The operationalization of the high-level political agreements and discourses is uncertain, and the policies in practice should also be evaluated on regional and city levels, just as the milestones of related strategic planning processes fostering local adaptive capacity. According to regional and urban governance, it is pivotal addressing not only mitigation but adaptation issues to be able to foster sustainable regional development, also considering the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specified in the Agenda 2030. Adaptation to climate change is increasingly becoming a priority for policy action. It also has high relevance to find the synergic interrelations towards an adaptive future. This paper evaluates the recent changes in Hungarian regional and urban planning in relation to climate policy approach and reports a state of adaptation oriented spatial planning on NUTS-3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) and LAU-1 (Local Administrative Units) levels. The results are based on the collection of all relevant climate change-related strategic documents on these levels in Hungary and on the analysis of specific information. There is a lack of knowledge related to the comprehensive adaptation policy and planning on regional and local levels in Hungary. The results of the evaluation show the state-of-art knowledge related to possible adaptation pathways and the various engagement level for climate policy approach on different spatial levels in Hungary. In the case of the examined research area, the development of more mitigation oriented planning documents and low level of adaptation measures and monitoring process management tools is seen as critical. © 2020, Hungarian Meteorological Service.

Large WWTPs usually have anaerobic sludge digesters to valorize sludge as methane and to reduce its mass. However, the low methane market price opens the possibility for generating other high value-added products from the organic matter in sludge, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). In this work, the economic feasibility of retrofitting two types of WWTPs to convert them into biofactories of crude PHAs was studied. Two cases were analyzed: (a) a large WWTP with anaerobic sludge digestion; and (b) a small WWTP where sludge is only dewatered. In a two-stage PHA-production system (biomass enrichment plus PHAs accumulation), the minimum PHAs cost would be 1.26 and 2.26 US$/kg PHA-crude for the large and small WWTPs, respectively. In a single-stage process, where a fraction of the secondary sludge (25%) is directly used to accumulate PHAs, the production costs would decrease by around 15.9% (small WWTPs) and 19.0% (large WWTPs), since capital costs associated with bioreactors decrease. Sensitivity analysis showed that the PHA/COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) yield is the most crucial parameter affecting the production costs. The energy, methane, and sludge management prices also have an essential effect on the production costs, and their effect depends on the WWTP's size. © 2020 by the authors.","Anaerobic digestion; Bioplastics; Economic analysis; Methane; Resource recovery; Sewage sludge; WWTP size","Anaerobic digestion; Chemical oxygen demand; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Methane; Operating costs; Sensitivity analysis; Sewage sludge; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic sludge digestion; Crucial parameters; Economic feasibilities; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Single-stage process; Sludge management; Value added products; Sludge digestion; activated sludge; feasibility study; polymer; sewage treatment; wastewater treatment plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084502244

A multi-temporal assessment of land use was made by remote sensing, while sustainability criteria were analyzed using the multicriteria analysis (MCA) with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). In addition, we established recommendations for soil carbon management in semi-arid ecosystem soils that contribute to climate change mitigation. The results show an increase of the urbanized area from 3.8% to 22.3% in the studied period, identifying up to 15% of buildings in zones with some type of restriction. In 71% of the cases, urbanization caused the sealing of productive agricultural soils (2519 Ha), almost 20% of which were of the highest quality. In last few decades, an excessive increase of built-up areas in comparison to population dynamics was identified, which causes unnecessary soil sealing that affects the food production and the capacity to mitigate climate change by managing the carbon cycle in the soil. © 2020, by the authors.","City expansion; Climate change; Land use management; Soil organic carbon; Soil sealing","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Ecosystems; Land use; Remote sensing; Soils; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Agricultural soils; Climate change mitigation; Multi-criteria analysis; Multi-temporal analysis; Semi-arid ecosystems; Sustainability criteria; Urban agglomerations; Urban sustainability; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084262095

Here, we present a United States-based wildfire case study of the northern Rocky Mountains to investigate links between wildfire experience, knowledge, and perceived risk due to climate change and potential policy support for two internationally relevant strategies: land management and private/public collaboration. The 2017 fire season was one of the worst on record in the northern Rocky Mountains resulting in billions of dollars in damage and multiple casualties warranting exploration. In order to inform wildfire policy pertaining to forest land management and private/public collaboration, a survey (N = 1154) was conducted in August of 2017 among residents of 34 counties in the northern Rocky Mountains who had either experienced a close proximate large wildfire (n = 611) or had not (n = 543). Consistent with construal level theory, residents who perceived climate change is occurring had a clearer understanding of the link between climate change and local conditions (e.g., drought). Those who experienced a wildfire were more likely to support adaptive policies (i.e., land management changes, increased private/public collaboration). Residents who experienced a wildfire but did not perceive climate change risks (experienced/no risk) were less likely to attribute wildfires to drought conditions and more likely to support land management initiatives. Residents who experienced a wildfire and perceived climate change risks (experienced/risk) were more supportive of collaboration, but not land management initiatives.

We have proposed previously that vitrification would trace wood flash-pyrolysis induced by aeroplasma and lightning due to the production of ionized aerosols in the atmosphere and their accumulation in the tissues during the tree growth. Here we further explore the factors involved in vitrification by flash-pyrolysis, in terms of firing processes, heating rates and wood composition. Our study promotes the challenging potential of vitreous chars and related by-products in archaeological firing assemblages to explore the link between atmospheric conditions, fuel properties and heating processes which has never been so far debated. Our study is based on the comparison of firing-assemblages from diverse archaeological contexts and the ones from solar reactor experiments as well as present-day firing situations. We focus on the characteristics of charcoals showing different stages of vitrification and on the tightly associated polymeric compounds. Their in situ structure characterization and composition are performed at meso to nanoscale with the SEM-EDS in backscattered mode and completed by TEM, Raman spectrometry and XRD analyses. Biomass thermochemical conversion for gas production provides a solid knowledge to understand that the extreme vitrification of wood fuel can only be induced by flash-pyrolysis. This process is shown to involve depolymerisation of wood tissues and reformation of diverse carbonaceous solid phases, along to degassing of the most volatile compounds. Wood vitrification due to flash-pyrolysis can thus be traced by a continuum of pyrolytic residues formed of lamellar to vesicular charcoals, black carbon aggregates, polymerised plant fragments, polymer films and filaments and densely recrystallized ash. We establish the key influence of non-condensable gas with metal and mineral impurities of high electrical conductivity that were incorporated within the plant tissues on the characteristics of the solid residues formed by flash-pyrolysis and on their properties. The pyrolytic debris share in common a nanostructuration, an imbrication at nanoscale of mineral and carbonaceous phases and nanostructured metal films. Using the record of present-day lightning-strikes, we describe the assemblage of pyrolytic debris and their characteristics to trace primary flash-pyrolysis that is instantaneously produced by the sudden release of incondensable gases and segregation of impurities. We show the difference of pyrolytic debris formed by a secondary flash-pyrolysis that can be locally achieved in long-maintained high temperature heating due to enhanced concentrations of non-condensable gases in confined pores. The characteristics of the strongly vitrified chars with the associated pyrolytic debris of the archaeological firing assemblages match the ones of primary flash-pyrolysis, but not the ones of lightning-strikes. Instead, we propose that they would have formed under periods marked by enhanced atmospheric electrification and production of electrically charged aerosols. Our observations emphasize the key-role of graphitized nanocarbons with their bound catalytic metals from possible volcanic sources on the initiation of flash-pyrolysis in air or at the ground and on the long-term protection of the produced pyrolytic residues. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Archaeology; Charcoal; Electrification; Flash-pyrolysis; Nanoparticles; Non-condensable gases; Polymers; Vitrification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078721887

Improving the sustainability of existing housing stock is a major challenge facing the UK social housing sector. There is a lack of support to navigate the growing and often incongruent information relating to sustainable development and how to operationalise it. The problem is twofold; first, the current (single criterion) condition-based approach to maintenance planning constrains asset managers and does not fully address the social, environmental and economic aspects of sustainability. Second, the toolkits available for assessing the sustainability of housing are often generic and are time consuming and expensive to implement. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports the findings of a participatory research project with a leading London-based housing association, using a series of landlord and tenant workshops to derive a set of attributes associated with KPIs to fully reflect the local requirements of the landlord and their interpretation of the sustainability agenda. Five KPIs are considered to be measurable, directly affected by maintenance work and independent of each other were identified by this landlord (comfort, running costs, adaptability, maintenance costs and community). Findings: The resulting outputs, in a policy context, will provide a clear route map to social housing landlords of how to improve the sustainability of their housing stock with the additional benefits of addressing fuel poverty and carbon emission targets, whilst at the same time, help create and maintain housing in which people want to live. Originality/value: The proposed approach is flexible enough to incorporate the individual requirements of landlords and be able to adapt to changes in government policy (local and central) in a timely, robust, transparent and inclusive format. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Building Asset Management; Housing; Key Performance Indicator (KPI); Performance Attributes; Sustainability","Asset management; Benchmarking; Housing; Maintenance; Planning; Condition-based approach; Design/methodology/approach; Existing housing stocks; Housing association; Key performance indicators; Maintenance planning; Participatory research; Performance indicators; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082564651

Significant reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will need to be achieved to meet these requirements whilst at the same time satisfying the more stringent forthcoming emissions regulations. This focus on techniques to reduce the tailpipe CO2 is increasing the interest in novel combustion technologies, including dilute combustion in gasoline engines. The pre-chamber based jet ignition concept produces high energy jets of partially combusted species that induce ignition at multiple locations in the main combustion chamber to enable rapid, stable combustion, even with dilute mixtures. The present study focusses on the beneficial synergies of the pre-chamber system with high geometric compression ratio (CR), Miller cycle operation and cooled external exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The study has been undertaken using the MAHLE 1.5 liter, 3-cylinder, downsized demonstrator engine. The interaction of the various technologies applied to the engine, will be discussed and the improvements in fuel consumption due to the technology package that has been applied relative to the baseline engine will be presented. A critical challenge for pre-chamber based combustion systems is achieving operation over a wide operating region and under low load and cold start conditions.

Thus, urban farming as a produce source has grown in popularity in recent years. One farming method that is gaining attention is urban rooftop farming, which integrates farming practices into city infrastructure without requiring expensive real estate or large warehouse-type structures with interior grow lighting. Rooftops in American cities represent the largest unoccupied urban space for agricultural purposes, but they remain underutilized. Selection of feasible and safe locations, obtaining permissions, designing and constructing the farm itself, selecting appropriate crops, and projecting farm outputs are all complex issues that impede the adoption of rooftop farming. To address such complexity, this project developed a prototype Decision Support and Planning Tool that assesses rooftop feasibility, supports informed and geographically appropriate rooftop farm design and crop selection, and predicts crop yield. The team implemented requirements analysis and functional decomposition to identify structural, safety and access requirements for rooftop farming. A second phase of the requirements analysis and functional decomposition was performed to identify agricultural methods and farm design. As a result, 'square foot farming' was selected as the appropriate basis for farm and tool design. Users are also guided to input their desired level of effort for maintenance, time to maturity, and crop yield to identify crops most suitable to the specific rooftop location. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to scale and calculate the weights associated with the users' maintenance preferences. A linear programming model based on knapsack optimization was used to project maximum total yield based on available square footage and crop yield preferences. Two proof-of-concept rooftop farms, generated by the prototype Decision Support and Planning Tool, were constructed in Washington, DC and Los Angeles. Prior to the spread of COVID-19, these farms were intended to validate model results against actual yield from crops produced over a 90day growing horizon. Instead, the farms validated rooftop assessment and crop selection tool functions. © 2020 IEEE.","Agriculture; Crop Selection Decision; Optimization; Rooftop Farms; Urban Planning; Yield Projection","Agricultural robots; Analytic hierarchy process; Carbon footprint; Crops; Decision support systems; Linear programming; Optical variables measurement; Requirements engineering; Scales (weighing instruments); Agricultural purpose; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Decision supports; Farming practices; Functional decomposition; Knapsack optimization; Linear programming models; Requirements analysis; Urban transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087068535

Strategic implementation of demand response (DR) programs and renewable energy (RE) integration can provide efficient solutions with several benefits such as peak load reduction, grid congestion mitigation, load profile modification, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. In this research, an incentive and price-based DR programs model using the price elasticity concepts is proposed. Economic analysis of the customer benefit, utility revenue, load factor, and load profile modification are optimally carried out using Freetown (Sierra Leone) peak load demand. The strategic selection index is employed to prioritize relevant DR programs that are techno-economically beneficial for the independent power producers (IPPs) and participating customers. Moreover, optimally designed hybridized grid-connected RE was incorporated using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to meet the deficit after DR implementation. GA is used to get the optimal solution in terms of the required PV area and the number of BESS to match the net load demand after implementing the DR schemes. The results show credible enhancement in the load profile in terms of peak period reduction as measured using the effective load factor. Moreover, customer benefit and utility revenues are significantly improved using the proposed approach. Furthermore, the inclusion of the hybrid RE supply proves to be an efficient approach to meet the load demand during low peak and valley periods and can also mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020 by the authors.","Demand response; Load profile; Price elasticity; Renewable energy; Strategic selection index","alternative energy; cost-benefit analysis; electricity industry; energy market; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; photovoltaic system; smart grid; Sierra Leone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083560672

Efforts to reduce food waste at the consumer level are urgently needed to address the most prominent nutrition and environmental sustainability issues we now face. Importantly, individuals report that saving money is a salient motivator for reducing food waste, yet contemporary evidence on the consumer cost of wasted food is lacking. The objectives of this study are to 1) estimate the daily per capita cost of food wasted, inedible, and consumed 2) at home and away from home, and 3) by food group. Methods: This study utilizes cross-sectional, nationally-representative data on food intake from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001-2016), linked with nationally representative data on food waste from published literature, as well as data on food prices and food price inflation from multiple publicly-available sources. Survey-weighted procedures estimated daily per capita expenditure on food waste for 39,758 adults aged ≥20 y. Results: Total daily per capita food expenditure was $13.27, representing 27% wasted, 14% inedible, and 59% consumed. The greatest daily food waste expenditures were observed for meat and seafood purchased for consumption outside of the home (.94, 95% CI: .90-0.99), and fruits and vegetables purchased for consumption in the home (.68, .63-0.73). Conclusions: The most cost-effective ways to reduce food waste at the consumer level are to focus waste reduction efforts on meat and seafood purchased for consumption outside of the home and fruits and vegetables purchased for consumption in the home. A number of strategies are available to help consumers reduce their food waste, which can increase their financial flexibility to purchase more healthy foods while simultaneously reducing environmental impact. © 2020 The Author(s).","Cost; Expenditure; Food waste; FoodAPS; LAFA; NHANES; Sustainability","adult; article; consumer; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; female; food intake; food waste; fruit; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; money; public health; sea food; United States; vegetable; aged; consumer attitude; cross-sectional study; economics; food; middle aged; United States; waste disposal; young adult; Adult; Aged; Consumer Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Food; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Refuse Disposal; United States; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083755690

The positions of the symmetric vibrational modes of CO3 2- and HCO3 -/DCO3 - were compared to density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a polarizable continuum model in light and heavy water. The experimental Raman peak positions shifted linearly toward lower wavenumbers with increasing temperatures. Raman scattering coefficients, measured relative to a perchlorate internal standard, were used to determine equilibrium molalities of the carbonate and bicarbonate species.

Here, we tested the responsiveness of archaeal communities on settled plant debris and sediment from a karstic lake to different organic carbon amendments (amino acids, plant-derived carbohydrates, and aromatics) using a lab-scale microcosm. Changes in the composition and abundance of sediment and biofilm archaeal communities in both DNA and RNA fractions were assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR, respectively, after 7 and 30 days of incubation. Archaeal communities showed compositional changes in terms of alpha and beta diversity in relation to the type of carbon source (amino acids vs. plant-derived compounds), the nucleic acid fraction (DNA vs. RNA), and the incubation time (7 vs. 30 days). Distinct groups within the Bathyarchaeota (Bathy-15 and Bathy-6) and the Thermoplasmata (MBG-D) differently reacted to carbon supplements as deduced from the analysis of RNA libraries. Whereas Bathyarchaeota in biofilms showed a long-term positive response to humic acids, their counterparts in the sediment were mainly stimulated by the addition of tryptophan, suggesting the presence of different subpopulations in both habitats. Overall, our work presents an in vitro assessment of the versatility of archaea inhabiting freshwater sediments towards organic carbon and introduces settled leaf litter as a new habitat for the Bathyarchaeota and the Thermoplasmata. © 2020 Compte-Port et al.

Life cycle inventory data from a SME meat processing site in regional Australia was used for benchmarking with existing industry data and for risk and opportunity identification along the supply chain. A LCA was conducted of the current operation and possible future energy supply scenarios involving the use of tallow, wastewater methane and biomass production, to identify the best performing option as part of a PhD project on SMEs and sustainability in agribusiness value chains. System expansion was used to handle all coproducts and byproducts. The area of land required to produce biomass was calculated and was compared to the catchment area for livestock, and an estimate was made of the non-arable land area required to produce biomass to offset all greenhouse emissions for the supply chain. Inventory data and LCA results for this SME were significantly different to previous LCAs. The system expansion resulted in large credits, particularly for edible offal. Climate change may not be a suitable proxy for other midpoint impact categories due to the difference in contributing processes. The best future energy appeared to be the biomass scenario, which involved using tallow for biodiesel production, capturing methane generated in the onsite wastewater treatment system for electricity generation, using tallow to generate the remaining electricity needs and using biomass for thermal energy production. Less than 0.5% of the non-arable land area required for producing the livestock for the plant was needed for biomass production, and if all supply chain emissions were offset using biomass, the land area required was 12% for life time grass fed beef. The potential for supply chain integration in the red meat sector appears promising, particularly in terms of offsets from biomethane use for electricity production, tallow use for biodiesel production and biomass production for thermal energy use.

We use a recently developed configuration of the NOAA GFDL chemistry-climate model – in which the atmosphere and land are coupled through dry deposition—to investigate the influence of ozone dry deposition on ozone pollution over northern midlatitudes. In our model, deposition pathways are tied to dynamic terrestrial processes, such as photosynthesis and water cycling through the canopy and soil. Small increases in winter deposition due to more process-based representation of snow and deposition to surfaces reduce hemispheric-scale ozone throughout the lower troposphere by 5–12 ppb, improving agreement with observations relative to a simulation with the standard configuration for ozone dry deposition. Declining snow cover by the end of the 21st-century tempers the previously identified influence of rising methane on winter ozone. Dynamic dry deposition changes summer surface ozone by −4 to +7 ppb. While previous studies emphasize the importance of uptake by plant stomata, new diagnostic tracking of depositional pathways reveals a widespread impact of nonstomatal deposition on ozone pollution. Daily variability in both stomatal and nonstomatal deposition contribute to daily variability in ozone pollution. Twenty-first century changes in summer deposition result from a balance among changes in individual pathways, reflecting differing responses to both high carbon dioxide (through plant physiology versus biomass accumulation) and water availability. Our findings highlight a need for constraints on the processes driving ozone dry deposition to test representation in regional-to-global models. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Here we apply findings from in-depth interviews of people whose daily lives interact with climate, weather and a range of natural resources. The interviews are meant to build a nuanced understanding of experienced climate knowledge, and while this approach cannot provide the type of data generated from user surveys, it can reveal local climate perceptions, challenges and understandings that can improve delivery of climate services. Resource users in Colorado's Gunnison Basin recognize the importance of climate in their livelihoods and want information that fits the scale of their land and resource interactions and that addresses the most salient local and regional climate elements, such as snowpack, runoff, and the timing and character of locally-defined seasons. We also find elements included in local notions of climate that might not arise in a climate needs survey, in this case the problem of dust from a nearby desert region that accumulates on the local snowpack and affects it melt. These findings have implications for the design of climate services, including how local climate perceptions, knowledge, and issues might be better understood and incorporated to improve salience of climate information. The findings presented in this paper, while in some cases distinctive to the study area, can offer guidance for climate services in other contexts. © 2020 The Authors","Climate services; Information needs; Perception; Resource-based livelihoods","climate change; information management; knowledge; livelihood; perception; runoff; snowpack; Colorado; Gunnison River; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087046623

We assume that the correlation matrix of the uncertainties in the prior is both spatially and temporally Gaussian, in order to produce a climate reconstruction that is smoothed both from month to month and from grid cell to grid cell. The pollen-based reconstructions include mean annual temperature (MAT), mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCO), mean temperature of the warmest month (MTWA), growing season warmth as measured by growing degree days above a baseline of 5 °C (GDD5), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and a moisture index (MI), which is the ratio of MAP to mean annual potential evapotranspiration. Different variables are reconstructed at different sites, but our approach both preserves seasonal relationships and allows a more complete set of seasonal climate variables to be derived at each location. We further account for the ecophysiological effects of low atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration on vegetation in making reconstructions of MAP and MI. This adjustment results in the reconstruction of wetter climates than might otherwise be inferred from the vegetation composition. Finally, by comparing the uncertainty contribution to the final reconstruction, we provide confidence intervals on these reconstructions and delimit geographical regions for which the palaeodata provide no information to constrain the climate reconstructions. The new reconstructions will provide a benchmark created using clear and defined mathematical procedures that can be used for evaluation of the PMIP4-CMIP6 entry-card LGM simulations and are available at https://doi.org/10.17864/1947.244 (Cleator et al., 2020b). © 2020 Author(s).",,"carbon dioxide; CMIP; data assimilation; growing season; Last Glacial Maximum; reconstruction; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083223793

Drainage of a soil profile reduces the water filled pore space (WFPS) in the upper soil horizons with consequences for N2 and N2O emissions, the fate of nitrogen (N), transformational processes and microbial and bacterial communities. The present intact soil column study with isotopically enriched fertiliser investigates all these aspects simultaneously under two WFPS treatments (80% (HS) and 55% (LS) saturation). Results showed significant differences in nitrous oxyde (N2O) emissions, in both pattern and amount, with maxima at 11.97 mg N2O-N/m2h for HS and at 1.64 for LS. Isotopic enrichment data showed a significant predominance (74.8–97.2%) of nitrification in LS, with a possible reduction in NH4 + but a higher concentration of nitrate (NO3 −) in N losses. Denitrification dominated in HS (72.5–73.4%), possibly leading to high ammonium (NH4 +) losses. Enrichment values showed differential apportionment patterns. A high component of N2O emission derived from denitrification in HS (6.0% HS; 0.4% LS) with a significant amount of N2O (62.9%) transformed to N2 (3.7% LS). A higher percentage of 15N was retained in LS soil. HS showed a lower amount of unaccounted N highlighting lower losses. Differences in gene copy concentrations (GCC) were found across most analysed genes (16S, nirS, nirK, nosZ1, nosZ2, amoA and nrfA). Both HS and LS treatments showed similar potentials for N2O production and its reduction to N2, but a reduced potential for nitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in HS. This study explained the effect of drainage and rewetting on gaseous emissions providing an explanation in terms of community switches. On the current soil type, structures to manage watertable heights would push the system towards complete denitrification with only N2 production but may present risks in terms of ammonia (NH3) and NH4 + losses. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Enriched fertiliser; Greenhouse gases; Isotopes; Nitrous oxide; qPCR","Ammonia; Denitrification; Fertilizers; Genes; Greenhouse gases; Hydraulic structures; Isotopes; Nitrates; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Polymerase chain reaction; Soils; Textures; Bacterial community; Dissimilatory nitrate reduction; Isotopic enrichment; Isotopically enriched; Nitrogen transformations; Nitrous oxide; qPCR; Water-filled pore space; Soil pollution; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; humic substance; isotopic analysis; nitrous oxide; transformation; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076629253

Based on this, we propose that psychological distance will influence the effect of risk versus efficacy framing on climate change engagement. In particular, risk perception related to the end-state expectancy of climate change mitigation should influence people's climate change engagement at farther distance. In contrast, efficacy perception related to the perceived feasibility of attaining end-state goals should influence engagement at closer distance. Results from an experimental survey based on a national sample that is both demographically and geographically representative (N = 1,282) supported our proposition. At closer spatial distance, perceived efficacy boosted by efficacy framing increased participants’ intention to perform climate mitigation behaviors. In contrast, at farther distance, risk framing increased behavioral intention through heightened risk perception. Based on these findings, we suggest that when communicating distant and abstract risks, highlighting their disastrous impacts may better motivate action. In contrast, when communicating impending and concrete risks, stressing the feasibility of action may have stronger motivational potential. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis","Climate change; efficacy; psychological distance; risk","Behavioral research; Decision theory; Risk perception; Risks; Behavioral intention; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Construal levels; efficacy; Experimental survey; Psychological distance; Spatial distance; Climate change; climate change; decision making; demography; local participation; mitigation; participatory approach; psychology; risk perception; aged; climate change; female; human; male; middle aged; motivation; risk assessment; Aged; Climate Change; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Psychological Distance; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078680582

However, political centralization and economic decentralization have subjected the local governments (LGs) to the dual constraints of environmental protection and economic development during the implementation of environmental regulation, which has resulted in the failure of conventional environmental regulation. To this end, the central government (CG) has established a central environmental protection inspection system (CEPIS). However, the existing literature has insufficiently studied the role and policy tools of the CG for inspecting the LGs and the polluting enterprises (PEs) to implement environmental regulation, and lacked systematic analysis of the strategic interactions and policy effects caused by CEPIS. Evolutionary game theory (EGT) provides a powerful tool with which to unpack the interactive strategies of Multi-Agent in China. By exploring the evolution of different participants’ behavior and their evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), EGT enables a robust, quantitative analysis of this three-party game. Simultaneously, some numerical examples serve to verify the theoretical results and support four key insights. First, the selection of environmental strategies manifests in a dynamic process of constant adjustment and optimization. Second, the whole evolutionary game system can converge on an ideal state under certain conditions. Third, increasing the investments in the special transfer payments of environmental protection, expanding the scale of emissions trading market, and improving the emission reduction benefits can motivate the PEs to reduce their emissions and the LGs to perform their duties. Fourth, in some scenarios, simply increasing the political penalties for the LGs fails to motivate the LGs to perform their duties. This research can provide the evolutionary mechanism and broaden our understanding of relationship between environmental regulation and emission reduction strategies. Related implications are finally proposed, which can offer valuable guidance on reforming the environmental regulation and improve market outcomes in China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Central environmental protection inspection; Environmental regulation; Evolutionary game; Stability","Commerce; Convergence of numerical methods; Emission control; Environmental management; Game theory; Inspection; Inspection equipment; Investments; Multi agent systems; Economic decentralization; Emission reduction strategy; Environmental pollutions; Environmental strategy; Evolutionary game theory; Evolutionary games; Evolutionary mechanisms; Evolutionary stable strategies; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082683386

However, the association between particulate matter (PM) and CVD risk among cancer survivors (alive >5 years since diagnosis) is unclear. We investigated the risk of CVD among 40,899 cancer survivors within the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Exposure to PM was determined by assessing yearly average PM levels obtained from the Air Korea database from 2008 to 2011. PMs with sizes <2.5 (PM2.5), <10 (PM10), or 2.5–10 (PM2.5–10) ffm in diameter were compared, with each PM level exposure further divided into quintiles. Patients were followed up from January 2012 to date of CVD event, death, or December 2017, whichever came earliest. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CVD were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression by PM exposure levels. Compared with cancer survivors in the lowest quintile of PM2.5 exposure, those within the highest quintile had a greater risk for CVD (aHR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07–1.59).

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are being designed to meet consumer demand for eco-friendly vehicles that offer increased power and improved fuel efficiency. HEVs are powered by an internal combustion engine (ICE) in combination with one or more electric motors that use electrical energy stored in a secondary battery, which is typically a lithium-based battery. With the use of such a hybrid drivetrain system, the fuel efficiency can be improved over that of conventional ICE vehicles. In this study, we conducted a vehicle-driving experiment to evaluate a transmission-mounted electric device (TMED) type parallel HEV using a chassis dynamometer and on-board diagnostics (OBD) signal-measuring equipment. In addition, we performed a numerical analysis using the CRUISE vehicle simulation code with experimental data. In our analysis, the engine output, which affects the torque of the drive motor, and the capacity (energy density) of the lithium-ion polymer battery were set as variables that affect the fuel-economy performance. As a result of this numerical analysis, a hybrid power-drivetrain model based on CRUISE was developed, and the current balance was evaluated according to the change in the battery capacity. We found that the battery state of charge (SOC) dropped because of a decrease in battery capacity. Thus, we predicted that the lithium-ion battery capacity would be reduced. © 2020 by the authors.","CRUISE software; Current balance; Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV); Lithium-ion battery (LIB); State of charge (SOC)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084755908

However, it is still unclear whether they can be used to track past climate changes due to the combined effects of climate forcing and topographic factors. We first explored shifts of the whole forest-steppe ecotone in northern China during the Holocene by collecting 383 topsoil pollen samples to establish discriminant functions representative of forest, forest-steppe ecotone, and temperate steppe. The discriminant functions were applied to 39 fossil pollen sites to reconstruct the range of the forest-steppe ecotone during the Holocene. Our results showed that the shift of the forest-steppe ecotone exhibited a generally consistent trend with the intensity of the EASM, which was characterized by southward retreat during the early Holocene from 12,000 to 8000 cal. yr BP, northward expansion during the middle Holocene from 8000 to 4000 cal. yr BP, and southward retreat during the late Holocene from 4000 to 0 cal. yr BP, suggesting a dominant role of precipitation provided by the EASM. However, some sites in mountainous regions still indicated forest group membership within the ecotone, implying possible vertical forest migration. We stress that EASM and topography co-determine the shift of the forest-steppe ecotone in northern China, and mountainous terrain differences also benefit the vertical forest migrations when threatened by the dry climate. Our study implies that future climate change may cause three-dimensional changes in vegetation, which should be considered in climate change mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","East Asian summer monsoon; Forest-steppe ecotone; Holocene; Pollen; Topography","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Forestry; Topography; Climate change mitigation; Dimensional changes; Discriminant functions; East Asian summer monsoon; Forest-steppe ecotone; Holocenes; Mountainous terrain; Pollen; Climate change; climate change; climate forcing; ecotone; forest ecosystem; forest-steppe; fossil record; Holocene; monsoon; pollen; summer; topography; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079292137

In order to explore how does carbon dioxide emissions reduction influence capacity utilization, this paper proposes a novel method to decompose the total capacity utilization (TCU) rate under carbon dioxide emissions reduction constraints using data envelopment analysis. The TCU rate is decomposed into an equipment utilization rate (EU), low-carbon technology efficiency (CTE), and policy oriented capacity utilization rate (PCU), and four policy orientations are then simulated to investigate the performance of TCU and its components. Three main conclusions are drawn: (1) the TCU rate was basically maintained between 60% and 70%, indicating a serious overcapacity in China. (2) most regions with a higher TCU rate are the well-developed southeast coastal regions, those with lower TCU rates being mainly the central and western regions; (3) the mandatory emission reduction mode is one of the main causes of overcapacity, where the southeastern coastal areas in particular suffer the most severe capacity loss. In comparison, a win-win development mode is the most cost-effective for China, with a relatively small capacity loss. These conclusions could assist policy designers in improving capacity utilization through effective low-carbon policies. © 2020","Capacity utilization; Data envelopment analysis(DEA); Directional distance function(DDF); Low-carbon policy","Carbon dioxide; Coastal zones; Cost effectiveness; Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Global warming; Capacity utilization; Capacity utilization rate; Carbon dioxide emissions; Directional distance function; Emission reduction; Equipment utilization; Low-carbon policies; Low-carbon technologies; Data reduction; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; emission control; pollution policy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078232912

However, the factors that determine the rate of carbon sequestration with afforestation are still poorly understood. We analyzed ecosystem carbon exchange after afforestation based on eddy covariance measurements with the aim to identify factors responsible for the rate of carbon exchange following afforestation. The results indicated that afforestation in the tropical/subtropical and temperate climate zones had greater capacities for carbon sequestration than those in boreal zones. Net ecosystem production (NEP), gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (RE) varied greatly with age groups over time. Specifically, NEP was initially less than zero in the < 10 year group and then increased to its peak in the 10–20 year group. Afforestation of varied previous land use types and planting of diverse tree species did not result in different carbon fluxes. The general linear model showed that climate zone and age of afforestation were the dominant factors influencing carbon sequestration. These factors jointly controlled 51%, 61% and 63% of the variation in NEP, GPP and RE, respectively. Compared to the strong regulation of climate on GPP and RE, NEP showed greater sensitivity to the age of afforestation. These results increase our understanding of the variation in ecosystem carbon exchange of afforestation and suggest that afforestation in subtropical and temperate areas after 20 years would yield greater carbon sink benefits than would afforestation of boreal regions. © 2019, The Author(s).","Afforestation; Age; Carbon sequestration; Climate; Eddy covariance","afforestation; age structure; biomass; Boreal Kingdom; carbon sequestration; climate effect; eddy covariance; gas exchange; global warming; primary production; respiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064803306

Using a multi-criteria optimization method based on energy, economic, environmental and adjustable factors, the optimal allocation ratio of hot water from the ICE is analyzed to maximize the performance of the hybrid CHP system for a specific case building. The necessary thermodynamic models of the system components needed for the optimization are presented. The results demonstrate that the increasing allocation ratio of mixed water for the heat pumps raised the output and coefficient of performance (COP).

However, the long term knowledge of spatiotemporal pattern of plantation forests (PF) is essential to understand the continuability and sustainability of the PF contribution and its spatiotemporal pattern comparing to nature forests (NF). Here we combined an inventory based map of PF, three up-to-date remote sensing leaf area index (LAI) datasets, and a process-based terrestrial biogeochemical model to investigate the interannual variabilities (IAVs) and trends of LAI and net primary productivity (NPP) of natural and plantation forests in China, from 1982 to 2014. We found that PF possessed similar spatiotemporal patterns as those of NF, while they exhibited a greater enhancement of both LAI and NPP since 2000. The total proportions of LAI and NPP in the plantation areas increased from 22% to 23.4%, and 22% to 22.8% from 1982 to 2014, respectively. Although different datasets provided diverse rates, an increasing trend was in agreement. The spatially-explicit analysis also illustrated that the increasing proportions were primarily contributed by the Southern sub-regions, particularly the Southwest and South sub-regions, while the PF in Northern sub-regions (e.g., Inner Mongolia and Northeast) even showed a decreasing contribution trend. The quantitative outputs from this study supported that PF promoted the greening trend in China since the 21st century. However, we also argued that the swift increase in LAI and NPP by PF should mainly result from the growing number of tree plantations and the rapid growth of newly planted forests. The proper management of PF is, therefore, an essential task for the maintenance and long-term improvement of their ecosystem services. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"Ecosystems; Remote sensing; Biogeochemical modeling; Ecosystem services; Interannual variability; Leaf Area Index; Net primary productivity; Plantation forests; Spatially explicit; Spatiotemporal patterns; Reforestation; afforestation; annual variation; data set; ecosystem service; leaf area index; net primary production; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; trend analysis; twenty first century; China; Ecosystems; Forests; Mongolia; Patterns; Ratios; Reforestation; Remote Sensing; China; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080089246

Experimental results showed that the Xi'an SALSCS maintained a strong nature convective flow created by thermal buoyancy, drawing a large volume of PM2.5-laden ambient air towards the filter banks and the center of the tower. The polluted air was filtered before discharging from the top of the tower. While filtration method works well, it requires changing and disposing these filter wastes on a maintenance schedule.

With this concept, a rain-shower based cleaning system utilizing falling water drops to remove the ambient PM2.5 was built at Yancheng Environmental Science Park, Jiangsu, China. In this system, there were a large array of spraying nozzles used to provide a sufficient residence time and high rainfall intensity to increase the collision frequency between incoming particles and falling droplets. Theoretical calculations showed that under flow speed of 0.2 m s−1 and using only 752 nozzles, the created sprays can remove PM2.5 by 35% in mass. Applying two layers of mesh screens to form water films to enhance the particle capture, experimental data showed an improved efficiency of 50%. Further increasing the number of nozzles and deployment area, the wet scavenging method is feasible to remove fine particles with much higher efficiency. In addition to the removal of PM2.5, an additional benefit of using the rain-shower technology is that if appropriate alkaline is dissolved in the water, the rain shower can also remove the precursor gases, e.g., adding NaOH for capturing CO2 to reduce the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric PM2.5 control; CO2 mitigation; Environmental sustainability; Precipitation scavenging; Water recirculation; Water spray","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Cleaning; Efficiency; Filter banks; Greenhouse gases; Rain; Sodium hydroxide; Solar chimneys; Spray nozzles; Sustainable development; CO2 mitigation; Environmental sustainability; PM2.5 control; Precipitation scavenging; Water recirculation; Water sprays; Air filters; Carbon Dioxide; Cleaning; Efficiency; Greenhouse Gases; Nozzles; Rain; Sodium Hydroxide; Sprayers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076540892

Spatial nonstationarity affects the relationship between urban expansion and ecosystem service value (ESV) loss, but its significance has been under-emphasized. To study the spatially-heterogeneous ESV loss, we integrated cellular automata (CA) with geographically weighted regression (GWR) in a model that considers the relationships between urban expansion and its driving factors. We used ten GWR bandwidths to construct the CAGWR models for reproducing rapid urban expansion at Chongqing from 2005 to 2010. We then used the CAGWR model with the best bandwidth to predict future urban scenarios out to 2030. Our modeling shows that CAGWR is strongly sensitive to bandwidth, and that the overall accuracy and Figure-of-Merit are maximized with a ~2 km2 bandwidth (about 150 samples). We examined ESV losses in eleven ecosystem classes and found that climate regulation and water flow regulation are the dominant drivers of ESV loss. From 2010 to 2030, Chongqing's urban area will increase by about 87%, resulting in substantial encroachment on agricultural land, dryland and shrubs, causing significant ESV losses of about 38%. Our results constitute an early warning of ecosystem degradation caused by massive urban development. This study improves our understanding of spatially-varying urban expansion and related ESV losses in rapidly developing areas and should help improve urban planning regulation and regional policy for sustainable development to maintain environmentally-friendly cities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bandwidth selection; Cellular automata; Chongqing; Ecosystem service values (ESV); Spatial nonstationarity; Urban expansion","Bandwidth; Cellular automata; Expansion; Flow of water; Urban growth; Bandwidth selections; Chongqing; Ecosystem service values; Spatial non-stationarity; Urban expansion; Ecosystems; cellular automaton; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; modeling; regression analysis; spatial analysis; urban development; agricultural land; article; body weight; city planning; climate; developing country; ecosystem; geographically weighted regression; human; major clinical study; nonhuman; shrub; sustainable development; urban area; water flow; water transport; China; Chongqing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077502225

Cloud screening strategies are essential to remove scenes with significant cloud and/or aerosol contamination from OCO-2 observations, which helps to save on the data processing cost and ensure high quality retrievals of the column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2). Based on the radiance measurements in the 0.76 μm O2A band, 1.61 μm (weak), and 2.06 μm (strong) CO2 bands, the current combination of the A-Band Preprocessor (ABP) algorithm and Iterative Maximum A Posteriori (IMAP) Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) Preprocessor (IDP) algorithm passes around 20%–25% of all soundings, which means that some contaminated scenes also pass the screening process. In this work, three independent pairs of threshold parameters used in the ABP and IDP algorithms are sufficiently tuned until the overall pass rate is close to the monthly clear-sky fraction from the MODIS cloud mask. The tightened thresholds are applied to observations over land surfaces in Europe and Japan in 2016. The results show improvement of agreement and positive predictive value compared to the collocated MODIS cloud mask, especially in summer and fall. In addition, analysis indicates that XCO2 retrievals with more stringent thresholds are in closer agreement with measurements from collocated Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) sites. © 2020, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","cloud screening; CO2 retrieval; MODIS; OCO-2; TCCON",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082576954

However, many studies have shown that it can also lead to increased energy consumption and carbon emissions. To study the effects of technological changes on carbon emissions, we decomposed technological changes into environmental technological changes and production technological changes. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of technological progress on carbon emissions by embedding the Solow residual model into the logarithmic mean Divisia index model. We used data from China's 30 provinces to calculate the regional effects of technological progress during 2005–2015. We drew the following conclusions: 1) China's overall domestic technological progress reduced carbon emissions over the study period; 2) technological progress in Central and West China significantly reduced carbon emissions, whereas that in East China slightly increased emissions; and 3) the relationship between technological progress and carbon emissions is complex and depends on both environmental technological changes and production technological changes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon emission; Environmental technological change; Logarithmic mean Divisia index; Production technological change; Technological progress","Technological forecasting; Carbon emissions; Divisia index; Logarithmic mean; Regional effects; Residual model; Technological change; Technological progress; West China; Energy utilization; carbon emission; emission control; environmental technology; technological change; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079171128

The emissions of large quantities of species-specific BVOC depend not only on environmental (temperature, T; photosynthetically active radiation, PAR), but also physiological parameters (i.e. net photosynthetic rate, Pn; transpiration rate, Tr; stomatal conductance, gs and intercellular CO2 concentration, Ci). Here, isoprene, monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions were determined from five dominant mature woody tree species in northern China, which are two evergreen conifers (Pinus tabuliformis and Platycladus orientalis) and three broad-leaved deciduous trees (Quercus variabilis, Populus tomentosa and Robinia pseudoacacia). A dynamic enclosure technique combined with GC-MS was used to sample BVOCs and analyse their fractional composition at daily and annual scales. The diurnal data showed that both isoprene and monoterpene emissions increased with increasing temperature, and reached their maximum emission rates in the peak of growing season for both coniferous and broad-leaved species. The emissions of individual compound within the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were statistically correlated with each other for all species. Furthermore, some oxygenated monoterpene emissions were highly correlated to sesquiterpenes in all tree species. Linking BVOC emissions to environmental and leaf physiological parameters exhibited that monoterpene emissions were linearly and positively correlated to the variation of T, PAR, Pn and Tr, while their relationship to gs and Ci is more complex. Collectively, these findings provided important information for improving current model estimations in terms of the linkage between BVOC emissions and plant physiological traits. The data presented in this study can be used to update emission capacity used in models, as this is the first time of reporting BVOC emissions from five dominant species in this region. The whole-year measurement of leaf-level BVOCs can also advance our understanding of seasonal variation in BVOC emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Broad-leaved deciduous species; Conifer species; Isoprene; Monoterpene","Forestry; Gas chromatography; Isoprene; Olefins; Physiological models; Physiology; Volatile organic compounds; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Conifer species; Deciduous species; Increasing temperatures; Monoterpene; Net photosynthetic rate; Photosynthetically active radiation; Physiological parameters; Monoterpenes; isoprene; monoterpene; sesquiterpene; terpene; volatile organic compound; coniferous tree; diurnal variation; isoprene; monoterpene; physiological response; seasonal variation; stomatal conductance; volatile organic compound; woody plant; air and air related phenomena; Article; biogenic volatile organic compound emission; chemical composition; China; circadian rhythm; Cupressaceae; mass fragmentography; oak; pine; Pinus tabuliformis; plant leaf; Platycladus orientalis; Populus; Populus tomentosa; Quercus variabilis; Robinia pseudoacacia; seasonal variation; temperature; woody plant; air pollutant; plant; season; tree; China; Coniferophyta; Pinus tabuliformis; Platycladus orientalis; Populus tomentosa; Quercus variabilis; Robinia pseudoacacia; Air Pollutants; China; Monoterpenes; Plants; Seasons; Trees; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077922563

Given constant changes in the concentration and the composition of atmospheric aerosol, uncertainty exists as to whether the current focus on PM2.5 mass or individual components may fully characterize the health burden of PM2.5. We proposed a component-adjusted method that jointly estimates the health impacts of PM2.5 and its major components while allowing for a potential nonlinear PM2.5-outcome relationship. Using this method, we quantified the effects of PM2.5 on the risks of developing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and dying from cardiovascular causes in comparison to three traditional approaches in the entire adult population across Ontario, Canada. We observed that PM2.5 was positively associated with AMI incidence and cardiovascular mortality with all four methods. Compared to the traditional approaches, however, the new component-adjusted approach demonstrated a significant improvement in explaining the health impacts of PM2.5, especially in the presence of a nonlinear PM2.5-outcome relationship. Using the new approach, we found that the effects of PM2.5 on AMI incidence and cardiovascular mortality may be 10% to 27% higher than what would be estimated from the conventional approaches examining PM2.5 alone.

Background and objectives: Carbon storage in small-scale stands of forests have been less studied compared to that in large-scale forests. The aims of the present study were to clarify the ecological functions of carbon storage and the economic value of homestead windbreaks to propose effective conservation strategies for old-growth homestead windbreaks in the face of climate change. Materials and Methods: On the small islands of Okinawa Prefecture, the dominant tree species used for the homestead windbreaks is fukugi (Garcinia subelliptica Merr.). We collected data on the diameter at breast height (DBH) and the height of 23,518 fukugi trees in 10 villages from 2009 to 2018. Results: The total amount of carbon stored in the remnant fukugi homestead trees of the 10 surveyed hamlets was 6089 t-CO2. The amount is equivalent to the carbon amount that is stored in a 40-year-old Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) forest, a representative tree species in Japan, of 20.9 ha area. Furthermore, the estimated economic value of the homestead trees was equivalent to USD 235,433, in terms of the plantation and management costs of 40-year-old Japanese cedar forests. This study revealed that homestead trees planted in an orderly line usually have a high density; hence, they have a high potential for biomass accumulation, carbon sequestration, and climate change mitigation. Moreover, homestead trees could contribute to a reduction in carbon diffusion, by cooling the house and reducing potential energy consumption. The findings related to homestead trees are consistent with those of other types of trees outside forests or small patches of trees: not adding to future land use competition and highly effective at carbon sequestration. Conclusions: The finding related to the carbon storage of homestead trees will provide basic information, as well as a new perspective on future local conservation and its contribution to climate change mitigation. This study suggests the necessity of the existing trees being properly managed, recruiting trees to be planted to replace old-growth trees, and replanting trees near newly established houses or old homesteads where trees have been cut. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Ecosystem services; Hedgerow; Small-scale forest management; Trees outside the forest","Climate change; Digital storage; Ecology; Economics; Energy utilization; Land use; Landforms; Potential energy; Storage (materials); Biomass accumulation; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Conservation strategies; Diameter-at-breast heights; Japanese cedars (Cryptomeria japonica); Sustainable management; Total amount of carbons; Forestry; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; conservation management; ecosystem function; environmental economics; environmental management; home garden; old-growth forest; plantation; sustainable development; valuation; Ecology; Economics; Energy; Forestry; Islands; Land Use; Japan; Okinawa [Ryukyu Islands]; Ryukyu Islands; Cryptomeria japonica; Garcinia subelliptica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084605775

They provide many ecological and sustainable benefits of greenery; reduce the adverse effects of high-rise building constructions. Though this concept is more popular across many countries over the past few decades, still, implementation of this technology in Sri Lanka is new and scant. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze the potential of green roofs in high-rise buildings in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach: The data collection was conducted through expert interviews and questionnaire survey. Expert interviews were carried out to validate the prospects and restraints identified through literature review to the Sri Lankan context and analyzed using content analysis. Questionnaire survey identified the most significant prospects and restraints using descriptive statistics and paired sample t-test. Purposive sampling was used to select participants. Findings: Reduction of air pollution, aesthetical appearance, thermal benefits and energy savings, reduction of an urban heat island effect, the addition of points in the green rating system are the top most significant prospects that need to be highlighted in promoting green roof systems in Sri Lankan high rises. Less space allocation on rooftops, lack of technical competence and lack of awareness and research are restraints that need most effective elimination strategies to encourage green roof systems. Originality/value: The first identified and quantified prospects and restraints for green roof system in Sri Lankan high-rise buildings can be utilized by the government, donors, multi-lateral agencies to promote the sustainable development in Sri Lanka and this knowledge could be used in different scale awareness programs.

Hence, it is desirable to optimize the effect of different input variables such as mixing rates, heating rates, flowrates, pressure and concentration of raw materials in order to ensure a high resource efficiency. The Attainable Region (AR) is an optimization method that uses geometric techniques to represent a region of all possible outcomes derived from a combination of parameters, bound by lines showing the limitations of the system. This review explores the successful development of AR in solving chemical reaction and processing problems, against the backdrop of limitations portrayed by other optimization techniques. The research demonstrates that AR methods have found a niche in this field, with many successful applications to problems of industrial importance such as in ammonia, methanol, butanol, lignocellulosic ethanol and comminution. This is due to the ability of AR to map out a global solution, unlike mathematical optimization superstructures which can give local optima, leaving the proprietor wondering if a better alternative does not exist. Coupled with a clear illustrative graphic interpretation and versatility in application, AR has a large potential impact in process optimization. There is no better time for such a tool, than the emergence of an environmentally conscious and resource efficient generation. Consequently, there is an increased demand for higher production efficiencies for both fossil and renewable energy feedstocks to curb emissions and reduce production costs, respectively. This research also traces AR applications in processes relevant in Waste-to-Energy (WtE) - a modern day research field where reactive conversions such as pyrolysis, gasification and bio-digestion are core. The complexities and catalytic inhibitions characterizing WtE conversions, heterogeneity of feedstock and poorly understood kinetics and thermodynamics of the reactions are actually a good opportunity for an optimization tool such as AR. Since AR can be built from experimental data or theoretical kinetic or thermodynamic models, it is a good choice optimization technique to employ in such a field with so many research questions and feedstock regimes. © 2020 The Author(s)","Attainable region; Kinetics; Optimization; Thermodynamics; Waste-to-energy",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077751648

In this study, SOC stocks were compared within three different hydrologic schemes in six freshwater wetlands of the Chi River Basin in tropical Northeast Thailand. The SOC concentration exhibited a decrease with increased depth and significantly differed among the hydrologic schemes (9.15 ± 0.84, 8.66 ± 0.67, and 5.53 ± 0.49 g C kg−1 for the intermittently flooded zone, saturated zone, and permanently flooded zone, respectively). The SOC stocks at 50 cm depth were significantly highest in the intermittently flooded zone (69.05 ± 10.86 Mg C ha−1), followed by the saturated zone and the permanently flooded zone (66.06 ± 7.75 and 43.39 ± 5.83 Mg C ha−1, respectively). Total SOC stocks among wetlands ranged from 123.30 to 291.29 Mg C ha−1. These differences indicate the spatial variability of SOC within wetland locations and among wetlands.

In this paper we develop a Bayesian Belief Network model that supports decision making to increase the availability of safe drinking water in five flood-prone rural communities in the Solomon Islands. We collected quantitative household survey data and qualitative cultural and environmental knowledge through community focus group discussions. We combined these data to develop our model, which simulates the state of eight water sources and ten sanitation types and how they are affected by season and extreme events. We identify how climate and current practices can threaten the availability of drinking water for remote communities. Modelling of climate and intervention scenarios indicate that water security could be best enhanced through increased rainwater harvesting (assuming proper installation and maintenance). These findings highlight how a systems model can identify links between and improve understanding of water and sanitation, community behaviour, and the impacts of extreme events.

Estuarine freshwater wetlands may experience increases in salinity during drought; however, the impact of salinization on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is uncertain. We measured ecosystem-scale GHG emissions from a wetland experiencing salinization during the 2011–2017 California drought and used information theory analyses to quantify couplings and causal interactions between CH4 fluxes and two dominant environmental drivers; gross ecosystem photosynthesis and temperature. Machine learning models were then used to estimate salinization-induced changes in CH4 fluxes and plant productivity. We observed dynamic CH4 flux-driver relationships across the salinization disturbance event, where temperature connections strengthened, and productivity connections dampened during salinization. Annual gross ecosystem productivity reduced by 64% during peak salinization, whereas annual CH4 emissions only reduced by 10%, suggesting that other CH4 substrate sources compensated for reductions in recent photosynthate. Our results demonstrate the value of applying information theory and machine learning approaches to ecological analyses and suggest that drought-induced salinization may increase GHG emissions from estuarine freshwater wetlands. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","carbon dioxide; complex systems; eddy covariance; peatland; photosynthesis; saltwater intrusion; transfer entropy","carbon flux; drought; greenhouse gas; machine learning; methane; net ecosystem production; photosynthesis; wetland; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071487561

For this reason, aggravated by the outdated building envelope of the healthcare building stock, large fenestration systems are usually avoided in hospitals, especially in old structures. However, with appropriate glazing specifications, the adoption of wider openings can result into significant energy savings, lower costs and strong positive effects on patients and staff well-being. The present study investigates how different window sizes and types of glazing affect heating, cooling and lighting energy demand in a hospital patient room. The objective is to evaluate the energy savings that may be obtained when installing larger windows and to identify the glazing properties allowing one to reach the maximum energy reductions. Simulations were carried out using nine diverse glazing systems, already available on the market, and their energy performance was evaluated in relation to two different window areas: a common size opening, characterized by a 25% Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR), and a floor to ceiling window, with 77% WWR. The analysis was conducted taking into consideration four different orientations in four Italian cities, supposing two artificial lighting control strategies. The results highlighted how the adoption of wider windows with appropriate glazings and a daylight-linked dimming lighting control strategy may lower the primary energy demand up to 17%. © 2020 by the authors.

In this paper, we study the impact of tariffs on domestic carbon intensities and carbon dioxide emissions. We find that tariffs increase carbon intensities and do not have an effect on carbon dioxide emissions. Since tariffs also reduce output, we conclude that by implementing tariffs the second best problem is invoked and overall market inefficiency increases. Additionally, since carbon intensities rise and overall carbon dioxide emissions do not decline, regional concerns over environmental quality and health should be raised.

This work deals with the integration of a thermo-chemical energy storage (TCES) system based on the calcium looping (CaL) process with a concentrated solar tower power (CSP) plant. The objective of this work is the integration of a conventional 320 MWe Rankine cycle with a direct calcination for energy harvesting. Particularly, this work addresses the use of CO2 as the working fluid of a compressed-gas energy storage (CGES) system for hybrid energy storage with the CaL process. The hybrid TC/CG-ES (thermo-chemical/compressed-gas energy storage) system can increase the competitiveness of the CSP with respect to conventional fossil-based power plants leading to a reduction in CO2 emissions. The thermal integration with the calcium looping (CaL) system is optimized by means of the pinch analysis methodology. The obtained results show a reduction in the electrical efficiency of about four percentage points with respect to the conventional Rankine power cycle without the CSP unit: the net electrical efficiency reduces from 43.7% to 39.5% while the global (thermal and electrical) efficiency of the plant reaches the peak value of 51.5% when low enthalpy energy is recovered (e.g., district heating network, district cooling network). This paper highlights the importance of the thermochemical CaO based material.

The Physiological Principles in Prediction Growth (3-PG) model has been successfully used for this purpose since 1997. In this study, the 3-PG model was parameterized and validated to predict the productivity of the most planted clonal eucalypts in Brazil (Eucalyptus urophylla) in different regions of the country and assess the attainable productivity of this same clone for a region little exploited for this plantations in the country. Through data collection carried out between 2012 and 2018, conducted in 36 sites distributed across an environmental gradient that spans over 3500 km in Brazil, it was possible to parameterize the 3-PG model using data that represent a portion of the soil and climate diversity of forest plantations in Brazil. We determined the initial biomass of the compartments (stem, leaf, and root), relationship between net and gross productivity, average wood density, maximum stem biomass for 1000 trees ha−1, maximum stomatal conductance, bark and branch fractions for the initial and mature age, specific leaf area for the initial and mature age, and allometric parameters at different ages. Considering the model initialization period, the initial age was defined at 12 months after planting and the final age was considered at 80 months. Model calibration was performed in four experimental sites (special sites for the calibration set), which correspond to the environmental diversities of the project, and model validation was performed by applying the setup of the model obtained in 10 other sites (regular sites for validation set) of the same experimental network. In all sites tested, estimates of basal area, diameter at breast height, leaf area index, and stem biomass agreed with the measured values. On average, the estimates of diameter and breast height were 4.91% higher than the observed measures, whereas the stem biomass estimates were 16.44% lower and the leaf area index was 26.22% lower; moreover, the estimates were overestimated for the first three years and underestimated in recent years. Overall, the model was able to capture the soil and climate differences for predicting E. urophylla clone productivity. Its application in a region not yet exploited for eucalypts plantations may help investors in the region select areas for acquisition, planting extensions, and extend production technologies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ecophysiology; Environmental gradient; Modeling; Process-based model","Biomass; Cloning; Ecology; Forecasting; Forestry; Models; Physiological models; Physiology; Productivity; Diameter-at-breast heights; Ecophysiology; Environmental diversities; Environmental gradient; Phenotypic plasticity; Physiological principles; Process-based modeling; Production technology; Climate models; allometry; ecophysiology; environmental gradient; environmental modeling; evergreen tree; exploitation; forestry production; model validation; parameterization; phenotypic plasticity; plantation forestry; stomatal conductance; Biomass; Ecology; Forecasts; Forestry; Models; Physiology; Brazil; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus urophylla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080069979

Seagrasses can be negatively affected by increasing seawater temperatures, but the effects of warming on CO2 and CH4 fluxes in seagrass meadows have not yet been reported. Here, we examine the effect of two disturbances on air-seawater fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in Red Sea Halophila stipulacea communities compared to adjacent unvegetated sediments using cavity ring-down spectroscopy. We first characterized CO2 and CH4 fluxes in vegetated and adjacent unvegetated sediments, and then experimentally examined their response, along with that of the carbon (C) isotopic signature of CO2 and CH4, to gradual warming from 25 C (winter seawater temperature) to 37C, 2 C above current maximum temperature. In addition, we assessed the response to prolonged darkness, thereby providing insights into the possible role of suppressing plant photosynthesis in supporting CO2 and CH4 fluxes. We detected 6-fold-higher CO2 fluxes in vegetated compared to bare sediments, as well as 10- to 100-fold-higher CH4 fluxes. Warming led to an increase in net CO2 and CH4 fluxes, reaching average fluxes of 10 422.18-2570.12 molCO2 m2 d1 and 88:11-15:19 molCH4 m2 d1, while CO2 and CH4 fluxes decreased over time in sediments maintained at 25-C. Prolonged darkness led to an increase in CO2 fluxes but a decrease in CH4 fluxes in vegetated sediments. These results add to previous research identifying Red Sea seagrass meadows as a significant source of CH4, while also indicating that sublethal warming may lead to increased emissions of greenhouse gases from seagrass meadows, providing a feedback mechanism that may contribute to further enhancing global warming. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

The retrofit systems, a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and diesel particulate filter (DPF), were evaluated individually using a US EPA tier 2 (ter 2) engine operated under four steady-state conditions and one transient cycle. The DOC effectively curtailed emissions of CO, and to some extent organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and aerosol number concentration. The DPF system offered substantially higher reductions in OC and EC mass and aerosol number concentrations. Both, the DOC and DPF achieved reductions in the aforementioned emissions without adversely affecting emissions of NO2 and nano-sized aerosols. The strategy of repowering with an advanced system was examined using a US EPA tier 4 final (tier 4f) engine equipped with a cooled exhaust gas recirculation system and diesel exhaust fluid-based selective catalytic reduction system, but not with a DPF system. The tier 4f engine contributed substantially less than the tier 2 engine to the EC and OC mass, aerosol number, and CO, NO, and NO2 concentrations. The tier 4f engine was very effective in reducing aerosol mass, NO, and NO2 concentrations, but it was not equally effective in reducing aerosol number concentrations.

Furthermore, the potential of biomass from the livestock and agricultural sectors in this village has not been well utilized. The purpose of this study is to determine the amount of energy use in the Thekelan hamlet, and analyze the potential use of renewable energy (biogas) to substitute conventional electricity. The method used in this research is descriptive qualitative combined with IPCC default methods based on a questionnaire from 40 respondents taken randomly. The result of the research shows that the use of energy sources from fuel wood is 9, 830 kg and LPG is 215.5. The number of cattle in the hamlet of Thekelan is 70 heads and 34 goats. The largest GHG emissions are generated from the use of fuel in animal husbandry activities with a value of 0.206 Gg CO2e/year while the lowest GHG emissions from LFG utilization activities are 0.008 Gg CO2e/year. The total emissions of all activities are 0.599 Gg CO2e/year. The use of biogas as an alternative energy is known to be able to reduce GHG emissions by 34.3% because the substitution of fuel wood and LPG is transferred to the use of biogas.

We modeled exposure to PM2.5 for the year July 2010 to June 2011 and estimated the burden of current mortality attributable to these sources. We also estimated the number of life-years that would be produced if emissions from wood heaters and power stations, the two largest emissions sources, were reduced. Wood heaters (assuming a real-world emissions factor of 11.4 g of PM2.5 per kg of wood burned) were the most important source of PM2.5 exposure, responsible for around 24.0% of the total anthropogenic PM2.5 concentration. On-road sources and power stations were also important, responsible for 16.9% and 10.5% of anthropogenic PM2.5 exposure respectively. Around 1.2% of mortality (5,900 YLL) was attributable to long-term exposure to all anthropogenic PM2.5, including 0.3% (1,400 YLL) attributable to wood heater–related PM2.5, 0.2% (990 YLL) to on-road sources and 0.1% (620 YLL) to power stations. Compared to ongoing emissions at 2010/11 levels, we estimated that a sustained reduction in emissions from wood heaters due to the introduction of an emissions standard of 1.5 g of PM2.5 per kilogram of wood burned (real world emissions factor of 3.9 g of PM2.5 per kg of wood burned) and the associated reduction in PM2.5 population exposure would produce 90,000 life-years among the cohort of people alive in 2010/11. Complete removal of sulphur oxide emissions from power stations would produce 14,000 life-years and complete removal of nitrogen oxide emissions would produce 38,000 life-years. A range of sensitivity analyses indicate the true impact of PM2.5 from these sources is likely to be at least as large as these estimates. This assessment shows that eight sources are responsible for more than 60% of exposure to anthropogenic PM2.5 in the Sydney GMR. Although the burden of mortality attributable to each source is relatively small, interventions that achieve sustained reductions in emissions could provide substantial health benefits, which are likely to far outweigh the costs. © 2020 The Authors",,"Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Particulate emissions; Power plants; Roads and streets; Sensitivity analysis; Health benefits; Long term exposure; Metropolitan regions; Nitrogen oxide emissions; PM2.5 concentration; Population exposure; Real-world emission; Sydney , Australia; Wood; nitrogen oxide; sulfur oxide; anthropogenic source; concentration (composition); metropolitan area; mortality; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution exposure; air pollution; air quality; Article; Australia; controlled study; electric power plant; environmental exposure; long term exposure; mathematical model; mortality; particulate matter; population exposure; prediction; priority journal; air pollutant; air pollution; cohort analysis; human; toxicity; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Australia; Cohort Studies; Humans; Mortality; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079428941

It was driven by the mining industry for several decades. Despite certain changes in this area, a number of mineral and energy resources are still being mined in the EU. Nevertheless, mining activities are accompanied by many unfavorable phenomena, especially for the environment, such as greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions. The great diversity of the EU countries in terms of the size of the “mining and quarrying” sector means that both the volume and structure of these emissions in individual countries varies. In order to assess the current state of affairs, research was conducted to look at the structure and volume of these emissions in individual EU countries. The aim of the study was to divide these countries into homogenous groups by structure and volume of studied emissions. In order to reflect both the specificity and diversity of the EU countries, this division was based on the seven most important gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, NH3, NMVOC, CO, NOx) and two types of particulate matter (PM 2.5, PM 10) emitted into the atmosphere from the sector in question. The volume of studied emissions was also compared to the number of inhabitants of each EU country and the gross value added (GVA) by the mining and quarrying sector. This approach enabled a new and broader view on the issue of gas and air pollutant emissions associated with mining activities. The artificial Kohonen's neural networks were used for the analysis. The developed method, the analyses and the results constitute a new approach to studying such emissions in the EU. Research that looks only at the emission of harmful substances into the environment in relation to their absolute values fail to fully reflect the complexity of this problem in individual EU countries. The presented approach and the results should broaden the knowledge in the field of harmful substance emissions from the mining and quarrying sector, which should be utilized in the process of implementing the new European climate strategy referred to as “The European Green Deal”. © 2020 by the authors.

This linear abrasion apparatus simulates the mechanical solicitation, i.e. abrasion. Various particle size measurement techniques were applied to assess the size distribution and the quantity of particles released. Observations of airborne particle from abrasion tests are consistent with TEM characterization of the nanomaterials before any tests. Abrasions of both samples (called here ‘1’ and ‘2’) gave rise to emissions. For sample 1, a few ‘dust’ particles and micronic particles are observed. For sample 2, despite a track on the sample, no detectable micronic particles and very few ‘dust’, particles are detected. As a result, we can state there were effective abrasions which gave rise to a low emission (sample 1) and a very low emission (sample 2) under the detection limits of particle sizing and counting, for the last case. The emission of particles upon Taber test abrasion is extremely low (less than 8 particles per cm3) and for one of the samples at the level of the detection limit. Moreover, the size of these particles is generally larger than 100 nm. © 2020 INERIS","Health; Nanomaterials; Nanosafety; Occupational; Particle size; Safe by design; Silica","Abrasion; Dust; Erosion; Filled polymers; Health; Health risks; Industrial hygiene; Nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Particle size; Resins; Risk assessment; Silica; Filled composites; Mechanical solicitations; Micronic particles; Nanosafety; Occupational; Occupational health risk; Particle size measurement; TEM characterization; Particle size analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078825516

Calculations show that recirculation of SD could offset for losses in plant methane production by up to 2.4%. In that context, two post-treatments were evaluated to enhance residual potential methane of agricultural SD. Effect of fungal solid state fermentation (SSF) of SD on subsequent methane production has never been explored before. It was hypothesized that: (i) ligninolytic fungi would be able to specifically use the complex fraction of SD for their growth and (ii) energy generation from the subsequent anaerobic digestion of the colonized SD will be enhanced. However, experiments showed that thermo-alkaline treatment of SD (used as alkalinization and sterilization process) and a high spawn level (20% w/w) were necessary to perform fungal SSF. Besides, the observed fungal activities on SD did not target specifically the most complex fractions. This led to uncontrolled organic matter losses and subsequent decreases of biodegradability and methane yield of SD (up to 50%). Therefore, fungal SSF of SD before its recirculation into biogas plants appeared not to be a viable option. Only thermo-alkaline treatment (CaO 2% w/w and 121 °C 30 min) enhanced methane yield of SD by 13% and decreased its complex fraction by 25%. Further studies on optimization of this post-treatment may enhance efficiency of SD recirculation strategy to offset plant methane production losses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural biogas plant; Anaerobic digestion; Fungal post-treatment; Pleurotus ostreatus; Solid digestate recirculation; Thermo-alkaline post-treatment","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biodegradability; Biogas; Calcium oxide; Feedstocks; Fermentation; Fungi; Methane; Biogas plants; Digestate; Ligninolytic fungus; Pleurotus ostreatus; Post treatment; Recirculation strategies; Solid-state fermentation; Sterilization process; Anaerobic digestion; alkalinity; alkalinization; anaerobic digestion; biogas; fermentation; fungus; methane; organic matter; recirculating system; sterilization; thermodynamics; Fungi; Pleurotus ostreatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076716588

Nevertheless, its particles emissions are denounced. Nowadays, one of the most efficient second abatement emissions systems (SAES) for the particles consists of fabric filter. Nevertheless, this high trapping efficiency system is often bypassed due to condensation or burning issues. Small to medium-scale biomass combustion equipment are becoming an attractive non-fossil local and renewable energy means of production. Nevertheless, they remain poorly equipped with SAES because of their variable power output and subsequent condensation issues. This work presents an optimization of the working temperature range for fabric filter in order to produce a cleaner energy. The present study clearly demonstrates that the dew point temperature of the smoke, for any combustion conditions and any fuels, is always higher than 70 °C while the safety temperature of the fabric classically is 110 °C. Experimentations show condensation issues occur only during power change. The simulation of the optimization on the temperature range shows that the Total Suspended Particles emissions can be reduced by 55% (mass fractions) for the same energy production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bag filter; Biomass combustion; Dew point; Flying ashes; Particles emissions; Second abatement system","Biomass; Combustion equipment; Condensation; Smoke; Bag filters; Biomass combustion; Dew points; Dewpoint temperature; Second abatement system; Total suspended particles; Trapping efficiencies; Working temperatures; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077505522

The implied technical substitution alone may be too slow to contribute meaningfully to meeting ‘net zero’ carbon reduction targets. This paper uses established modelling techniques and prospective scenario analyses in a UK case study to investigate what the impacts might be if we were more ambitious, how much disruption is needed to meet climate goals, the role of lifestyle and social change, and the potential implications for key actors in transport energy systems. Existing policies may neither hit carbon reduction targets nor make the early gains needed for a Paris-compliant trajectory. Deeper and earlier reductions in carbon and air quality emissions can be achieved by more ambitious but largely non-disruptive change of a 2030 phase out that includes (plug-in) hybrids. The earlier phase outs combined with lower demand for mobility and car ownership would make significant contributions to an emissions pathway that is both Paris compliant and meets urban air quality goals. Some disruption for technology providers, business and government can be expected in the more ambitious cases.

The present study uses a three-phase adaptation framework to propose adaptation strategies aimed at overcoming socioecological barriers of the food–energy–water (FEW) nexus. Cradle-to-farm-gate land, greenhouse gas (GHG), and water impacts—that derive from food consumption in the United States—are analyzed and differentiated by major demographic groups (Black, Latinx, and White). Results indicate that the White demographic yields the highest per capita GHG (680 kg of CO2 eq⋅year−1) and water impacts (328,600 L⋅year−1) from food consumption, whereas the Black demographic yields the highest per capita land impacts (1,770 m2⋅year−1) from food consumption. Our findings suggest that obtaining data with the intention of building consensus across sociodemographic lines overcomes barriers in the understanding phase, leading to increased social receptivity for many planning and managing phase processes. Specifically, we find that identifying and developing leaders who possess the cognitive and interpersonal capacity to manage many variables and stakeholders is key to assessing and selecting adaptation options in the planning phase. We also propose using government programming to encourage environmentally friendly food purchasing behavior. Then, we discuss how our proposals could be used in adaptation feasibility and evaluation activities in the managing phase. In all, these findings facilitate the development of improved climate change adaptation and policy by satisfying the understanding phase of the climate change adaptation framework, establishing a cross-disciplinary methodological approach to addressing socioecological problems, and providing useful FEW impact data for FEW nexus and climate change researchers. © 2019 by Yale University","climate change adaptation; demographics; diet and environment; food–energy–water (FEW); industrial ecology; life cycle assessment (LCA)","Ecology; Food supply; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Population statistics; Adaptation framework; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; demographics; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Methodological approach; Purchasing behaviors; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; demography; diet; feasibility study; food consumption; governance approach; greenhouse gas; stakeholder; strategic approach; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063413617

Here, we integrate climate change anomaly with a land-use change model both projected for 2050 to identify refugia areas for 103 bird species that occur in the Brazilian Cerrado. We found that 13% of the Cerrado may serve as refugia for the bird species. In contrast, nearly 35% of the biome might become areas of high risk for those species. Most species (74%) will held from 34% to 85% of their current geographic distribution in areas with less native vegetation, but with low climate anomaly. Apart from the protection of the refugia areas, we suggest restoration of native vegetation in regions that are likely to maintain climate conditions more adequate in the future. These areas should be prioritized to protect places with higher species richness and ease the establishment of corridors that would support climate-induced dispersal from high risk areas to suitable ones.

The work is a case study in connection with the proposed Kiggavik project in Nunavut, Canada. A major challenge in simulating fluid flow through partially frozen porous media is how to define the transient hydraulic conductivity as a function of temperature. An indirect approach based on the similarity between soil freezing and soil–water characteristic curves for unsaturated soils is implemented to define the relation between unfrozen water content and cryogenic suction which is linked to temperature by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation. Richard’s equation is then used to model fluid flow in partially frozen ground conditions. Finite element numerical modelling results of a worst-case climate change scenario indicate that although the permafrost could disappear completely in about 750 years with an increase in 7∘C in the mean annual ground surface temperature during the next 100 years, the groundwater level around tailings facility would be approximately 35 m below ground surface. Hence, tailings pore water would not likely to migrate upwards to reach the ground surface even after the permafrost is completely disappeared. These conclusions are certainly within uncertainties and limitations of the analysis. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Fluid flow; Partially frozen ground; Permafrost; Unsaturated porous media","climate change; cold region; finite element method; frozen ground; groundwater flow; numerical model; open pit mine; permafrost; Canada; Nunavut",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062725465

Seventy percent of marine PP is generated by phytoplankton photosynthesis. However, the phytoplankton productivity rate is dependent on the photo-physiological state of phytoplankton cells, as well as other environmental conditions. To consider these variables appropriately, refine the current estimates of PP, and reduce the laboursome and lengthy methodologies of radiocarbon estimates, we have created “Phyto-VFP” (Variable Fluorescence Phytoplankton Production), a new bio-optical model classified as a Wavelength and Depth-resolved (WDR) model. The model integrates the effect of the photo-acclimation processes on the “active” fraction of the phytoplankton population with the dynamic of the water column, parametrised through a series of laboratory experiments based on in vivo variable fluorescence measures on the marine diatom Skeletonema costatum (Greville) Cleve. The performance of Phyto-VFP was compared with concurrent estimates of radiocarbon (14C) uptakes, under different dynamic and optical conditions, during two oceanographic cruises (SAMCA3 and SAMCA4) in the Mediterranean Sea. The low Root Mean Square Differences (RMSDs) show that Phyto-VFP performs well when estimating phytoplankton PP. When compared to other bio-optical models, Phyto-VFP estimates of PP in coastal waters were closer to radiocarbon measurements than other models could predict [e.g., the Morel model (MM)]. The application of Phyto-VFP to the SAMCA dataset and its comparison to MM allowed the assessment of model performance under three different physical and biological conditions, in which it was possible to analyse how photo-physiological responses of phytoplankton influence PP. © 2019","Dynamics; Mathematical model; Photo-acclimation processes; Photochemical efficiency; Photosynthesis; Primary production","Dynamics; Estimation; Fluorescence; Image processing; Mathematical models; Photosynthesis; Physiology; Phytoplankton; Environmental conditions; Laboratory experiments; Photochemical efficiency; Physiological response; Phytoplankton productions; Phytoplankton productivity; Primary production; Root mean square differences; Physiological models; biological uptake; carbon cycle; climate feedback; coastal water; diatom; environmental conditions; estimation method; fluorescence; hydrodynamics; numerical model; optical property; photochemistry; photosynthesis; physiology; phytoplankton; primary production; water column; Mediterranean Sea; Nitzschia alba; Skeletonema costatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077328585

In the age of climate change, there could be cascading failures through a range of infrastructure breakdowns. Direct and indirect damage costs could exceed what had been estimated in traditional risk assessments. This could be exacerbated through abrupt price peaks in international supply chains of minerals, and through events happening in remote parts of the world that affect extraction and vulnerable industries. The core argument made here is one of feedbacks: climate adaptation has significant resource implications, and how resources are being used will have implications on climate strategies. Industrial Ecology has a role to play assessing those interactions and providing a better grasp of the spatial dimension of material flows, partly to track those flows and align them to specific actors, and partly to address interlinkages across different flows and their stocks (‘the resource nexus’). Methodological novelties are needed to better understand the resource base and the socio-economic dimension, especially on innovations and transitions that can help to cope with the challenges ahead.

This requires an understanding of environmental impact potential and detectability of a range of hypothetical leak scenarios. In the absence of a significant body of real-world release experiments this study collates the results of 86 modelled scenarios of offshore marine releases derived from five different model systems. This synthesis demonstrates a consistent generalised relationship between leak rate, detectability and impact potential of a wide range of hypothetical releases from CO2 storage, which can be described by a power law. For example a leak of the order of 1 T per day should be detectable at, at least, 60 m distance with an environmental impact restricted to less than a 15 m radius of the release point. Small releases are likely to require bottom mounted (lander) monitoring to ensure detection. In summary this work, when coupled with a quantification of leakage risk can deliver a first order environmental impact assessment as an aid to the consenting process. Further this work demonstrates that non-catastrophic release events can be detected at thresholds well below levels which would undermine storage performance or significantly impact the environment, given an appropriate monitoring strategy. © 2019","Assurance; Carbon capture and storage; Detection; Environmental impact; Offshore","Carbon capture; Climate change; Environmental impact assessments; Error detection; Offshore oil well production; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Assurance; CO2 storage; Detectability; Model system; Monitoring strategy; Offshore; Release experiments; Storage performance; Environmental impact; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; environmental impact assessment; offshore application; risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078125664

Yet existing studies indicate that adding energy storage actually increases emissions. The difference may be explained by the absence in the previous literature of “investment effects” – changes in deployment of other generation technologies after storage is deployed. Our paper tests this hypothesis by evaluating battery-storage-induced emissions changes using a model that accounts for both long-run investment and dispatch effects simultaneously across regions in the United States, which can be used to separate the relative magnitudes of these two effects. Model results indicate that the investment effect dominates the dispatch effect under a range of sensitivities. We find that emissions may increase or decrease with battery storage, depending on policy and market assumptions, with reductions more likely in environments where wind and solar are more economically competitive relative to natural-gas-fired generation. These results suggest that existing studies that only account for operational impacts likely underestimate potential emissions changes from battery storage deployment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity grid; Emissions; Energy storage; Energy systems modeling; Power sector economics; Renewable energy","Economics; Electric batteries; Electric power system economics; Energy storage; Gas emissions; Investments; Particulate emissions; Electricity grids; Energy systems modeling; Gas-fired generation; Generation technologies; Operational impacts; Power sector; Regional power systems; Renewable energies; Battery storage; alternative energy; economic analysis; electronic equipment; energy market; energy storage; power plant; solar power; wind power; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080036719

The protection of mangroves for mitigation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as well as for multifaceted sustainable growth of ecosystem is of great scientific concern. Mangrove vegetation in Kerala is now restricted largely to river mouths and tidal creeks with about 15 species of mangroves and 8 associated species. Kannur holds the largest mangrove area in Kerala with an area of about 32 Km2. Located at 12°15′ North and 75°13′ East, Kunhimangalam, in Kannur district, has luxuriant mangroves. A considerable part of mangroves are undergoing destruction and over exploitation. There are organised attempts to acquire all the mangrove areas under private ownership by the real estate groups. Although a large scale conversion of the mangroves was prevented by the timely intervention of local people and NGOs, long term preservation of this system is under question. The urge to establish this mangrove as a protected area is very relevant in this context. The aim of the study is to promote restoration of these mangroves through community and government participation. The study integrates field inventory data with the satellite images. Analysis involves four major steps, namely, (i) Image processing, (ii) derivation of vegetation indices using satellite imagery (iii) ground truthing through field stratification and collection of field inventory data and (iv) calculation of carbon stock. The satellite image of 18th January 2015 is used for the study. Using ERDAS IMAGINE 9.2, the layers are stacked and given standard False Color Composite (FCC) for better vegetation analysis using ArcGIS. The vegetation indices (VIs) can estimate the biomass of mangroves from remote sensing images and the most appropriate one is the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). The NDVI is based on absorption in the red spectrum and very strong reflectance in the near infrared spectrum. Ground truthing is done to establish relationship between NDVI from Satellite imagery and Above-ground biomass (AGB) from field observations. Reference pixels are selected as those for which actual data are known. A regression equation is developed to calculate the AGB for the entire plot from the NDVI values in the imagery. Allometric equations for Above-ground biomass (AGB) and below-ground biomass (BGB) developed by Komiyama et al. (2005) is used in this study. The overall ratio of BGB to AGB is 0.38. Total biomass is taken as the sum of AGB and BGB. Carbon content can be obtained by multiplying the total biomass by a conversion factor 0.475. AGB values ranges from 636.832 gm to 32048.5 gm per pixel and BGB ranges from 241.996 gm to 12178.4 gm per pixel. Total biomass ranges from 878.828 gm to 44226.9 gm per pixel and carbon content per pixel ranges from 417.443 gm to 21007.8 gm. Of the total 70.6% is contributed by high class vegetation which is covering 61% of the total area. Medium class contributes 16.74% of carbon with coverage of 29.55% area and low class provide 12.66% carbon sequestration with 9.44% area coverage. Comparing the area coverage, high and low class vegetation type is more effective in contributing carbon sequestration. Low class vegetation area is mainly covered with dry grass which has low reflectance and low NDVI, but has high carbon content. Rhizhophora mucronata, Excoecaria agallocha and Bruguiera cylindrical are the species that contribute more. The estimated total carbon of 12.67 tonnes and presence of eight different mangrove species in an area of 12 acres indicates this mangrove forest is in good health. © 2018","Carbon sequestration; GIS; Ground-truthing; Mangrove; NDVI","Absorption spectroscopy; Biomass; Carbon; Conservation; Ecology; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Information use; Infrared devices; Near infrared spectroscopy; Pixels; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Carbon sequestration; Ground truthing; Long-term preservation; Mangrove; NDVI; Near infrared spectra; Normalised difference vegetation index; Remote sensing images; Forestry; ArcGIS; carbon sequestration; environmental restoration; image processing; local participation; mangrove; NDVI; phytomass; protected area; satellite imagery; stock assessment; India; Kannur; Kerala; Bruguiera; Excoecaria agallocha; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058682186

Performing emissions testing outside a laboratory setting immediately raises the question of the impact of ambient conditions-especially temperature-on the results. In the spirit of RDE legislation, a wide range of ambient temperatures are permissible, with mathematical moderation (correction) of the results only permissible for ambient temperatures &lt;0°C and &gt;+30°C. Within the standard range of temperatures (0°C to +30°C), no correction for temperature is applied to emissions results and the applicable emissions limits have to be met. Given the well-known link between the thermal state of an engine and its emissions following cold start, ambient temperature can be of great importance in determining whether a vehicle meets emissions requirements during an RDE test. This paper reports the results of full RDE-compliant on-road emissions tests performed on a Euro 6d-TEMP passenger car with a direct injection spark ignition engine and a gasoline particle filter. Testing was performed at two temperatures, both lying within the ""standard"" temperature range for RDE testing: +25°C and +8°C. Regulated gaseous emissions, particle number and CO2/fuel consumption results are presented and discussed. Overall, as expected, emissions following cold start were significantly higher at the lower test temperature. Nevertheless, the long distance covered during RDE tests (~70-100 km) and their urban phases (&gt;16 km, often ~25 km) weakens the impact of this effect. Some simple mathematical analyses of the results from various portions of the trip are presented. © 2020 SAE International.

However, few studies have focused on the effects of drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA), a new type of extreme climate event, on the transformation of P in farmland systems. In this study, we, therefore, focused on DFAA effects on available P (AP) in topsoil, soluble P (SP) and total P (TP) in surface runoff, as well as plant P contents and P uptake in summer maize farmland systems. Field control experiments (sheltered under a ventilated shed with an artificial rainfall device) were conducted to simulate two levels of DFAA (i.e., light drought-light flood and moderate drought-light flood) during parts of two summer maize growing seasons (i.e., seeding-jointing stage and tasseling-grain filling stage). Results showed that DFAA increased AP concentration in topsoil, which was probably induced by the accumulation of the phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria under moderate drought and by an increase in phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB), especially the genera Bacillus and Bradyrhizobium. In addition, broken soil aggregates and increasing soil porosity caused by DFAA could also cause an increase of AP in topsoil. Soluble P and TP in surface runoff showed a decreasing trend with moderate drought in DFAA. The higher AP increased the root P uptake, while P in stems and leaves could be transported to fruits under DFAA with moderate drought. The results could provide some references for the study of the effects and adaptation-strategies related to extreme climate events and their effects on P in farmland systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial community; Extreme climate events; Phosphorus transport; Summer maize; Surface runoff; Topsoil","Bacteria; Bacteriology; Drought; Eutrophication; Floods; Grain (agricultural product); Phosphorus; Plants (botany); Porosity; Runoff; Bacterial community; Extreme climates; Phosphorus transport; Summer maize; Surface runoffs; Topsoil; Farms; agricultural land; bacterium; drought stress; eutrophication; extreme event; flood; maize; microbial activity; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; runoff; topsoil; Actinobacteria; Bacillus (bacterium); Bacteria (microorganisms); Bradyrhizobium; Proteobacteria; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077213448

Data is combined for buildings, installed technologies, fuel consumption and energy supply for Member States from 1990 to 2015, to analyse the importance of large-scale infrastructures and supply chains. Primary energy supply for residential heating is mainly based on fossil fuels; 70% in 2015 with 69% imported. The building level technologies are dominated by non-condensing boilers and stoves. Primary and final energy consumption decreased in spite of an increase in the total occupied living area in most countries. Path-dependency effects are found in the residential heat supply in EU. The analysis show path-dependent trajectories are present in most Member States, especially regarding natural gas infrastructure. The period shows many options for decarbonisation are not used to the full potential, e.g., energy efficiency in buildings, district heating, heat pumps.

According to 2016 WHO data, Georgia's mortality index attributed to ambient and indoor air pollution was 204.9, the 3rd highest in the world. Indoor air pollution is largely a result of indoor cooking/heating using solid fuel and second hand smoke (SHS). Worldwide, 40% of children, 35% of female nonsmokers, and 33% of male nonsmokers are exposed to SHS. Annually, SHS exposure causes ~600,000 deaths (1% of mortality), with half of those deaths in women and over a quarter in children. LMICs are disproportionately impacted by SHS and related morbidity and mortality. In Georgia, the smoking prevalence is 58% in men (6th highest in the world) and 6% in women. Moreover, prior research found that 30% of Georgian adults were exposed the SHS in the past week in public places and 54% at home; 42% reported daily exposure.

In fact, buildings account for more than 30% of the overall energy demand worldwide, with projections for increases in this quota due to climate changes, urbanization, and higher living comfort standards. This study investigates the effects of climate changes on the heating and cooling energy demand of buildings in the most populated urban region in Canada, i.e. the city of Toronto in Ontario. Statistical and dynamical downscaling methods are utilized to generate several future weather files, starting from different baseline climates including the old Canadian Weather Year for Energy Calculation CWEC (representing the 1959–1989 period) and the new CWEC 2016 (representing the 1998–2014 period). In dynamical downscaling, a regional climate model is used to obtain a finer resolution than traditional general circulation models. The generated future weather data sets are then used for simulating the energy demand of 16 building prototypes. The simulation results show an average decrease of 18%–33% for the heating energy use intensity, and an average increase of 15%–126% for the cooling energy use intensity by 2070, depending on the baseline climatic file of use and building typology. The forecasted GHG emissions of each building prototype are then discussed. The results demonstrate the need to perform building modelling with sensitivity analysis of future climate scenarios in order to design more resilient buildings. © 2019","Building performance simulation; Climate change; Energy use intensity; Future weather file; Greenhouse gas emission; Statistical and dynamical downscaling","Buildings; Climate models; Energy management; Greenhouse gases; Sensitivity analysis; Building performance simulations; Building prototypes; Dynamical downscaling; Energy use intensities; Future climate scenarios; Future weathers; General circulation model; Regional climate modeling; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077184505

Focusing primarily on examples from the Asia-Pacific region (a region including low-lying coastal areas and islands that are frequently highlighted as exemplars of communities on the front line of climate change), this article discusses the need to integrate critical insights from disability studies into current understandings of climate change adaptation and mobility if we are to facilitate more inclusive, democratic and equitable adaptation in the face of climate change. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ableism; climate change; climate migration; Disability; small island developing states; social justice","article; Asia; climate change; disability study; disabled person; human; human experiment; poverty; seashore; social justice; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071312726

A variety of analytical and experimental methods are currently in use for this task. In this paper, an optimization-based estimation method is employed to assess fugitive landfill methane emissions. The method combines inverse plume modeling with ambient air methane concentration measurements. Three different measurement approaches are tested and compared. The method is combined with surface emission monitoring (SEM), above ground drone emission monitoring (DEM), and downwind plume emission monitoring (DWPEM). The methodology is first trialed and validated using synthetic datasets in a hand-generated case study. A field study is also presented where SEM, DEM and DWPEM are tested and compared. Methane flux during two-days measurement campaign was estimated to be between 228 and 350 g/s depending on the type of measurements used. Compared to SEM, using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) allows for a rapid and comprehensive coverage of the site. However, as showed through this work, advancement of DEM-based methane sampling is governed by the advances that could be made in UAS-compatible measurement instrumentations. Downwind plume emission monitoring led to a smaller estimated flux compared with SEM and DEM without information about positions of major leak points in the landfill. Even though, the method is simple and rapid for landfill methane screening. Finally, the optimization-based methodology originally developed for SEM, shows promising results when it is combined with the drone-based collected data and downwind concentration measurements. The studied cases also discovered the limitations of the studied sampling strategies which is exploited to identify improvement strategies and recommendations for a more efficient assessment of fugitive landfill methane emissions. Implications: Fugitive landfill methane emission estimation is tackled in the present study. An optimization-based method combined with inverse plume modeling is employed to treat data from surface emission monitoring, drone-based emission monitoring and downwind plume emission monitoring. The study helped revealing the advantages and the limitations of the studied sampling strategies. Recommendations for an efficient assessment of landfill methane emissions are formulated. The method trialed in this study for fugitive landfill methane emission could also be appropriate for rapid screening of analogous greenhouse gas emission hotspots. © 2020, © 2020 A&WMA.",,"Antennas; Drones; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Inverse problems; Methane; Monitoring; Municipal solid waste; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Concentration Measurement; Improvement strategies; Measurement instrumentation; Methane concentrations; Municipal solid waste landfills; Optimization based methods; Unmanned aerial systems; Land fill; methane; methane; air monitoring; concentration (parameter); environmental temperature; field study; landfill; meteorology; plume; priority journal; unmanned aerial vehicle; wind speed; air pollutant; comparative study; environmental monitoring; procedures; theoretical model; waste disposal facility; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Methane; Models, Theoretical; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081315844

As a result, a plethora of SDS methods is nowadays available to climate scientists, which has motivated recent efforts for their comprehensive evaluation, like the VALUE initiative (http://www.value-cost.eu, last access: 29 March 2020). The systematic intercomparison of a large number of SDS techniques undertaken in VALUE, many of them independently developed by different authors and modeling centers in a variety of languages/environments, has shown a compelling need for new tools allowing for their application within an integrated framework. In this regard, downscaleR is an R package for statistical downscaling of climate information which covers the most popular approaches (model output statistics - including the so-called ""bias correction"" methods - and perfect prognosis) and state-of-the-art techniques. It has been conceived to work primarily with daily data and can be used in the framework of both seasonal forecasting and climate change studies. Its full integration within the climate4R framework (Iturbide et al., 2019) makes possible the development of end-to-end downscaling applications, from data retrieval to model building, validation, and prediction, bringing to climate scientists and practitioners a unique comprehensive framework for SDS model development. In this article the main features of downscaleR are showcased through the replication of some of the results obtained in VALUE, placing an emphasis on the most technically complex stages of perfect-prognosis model calibration (predictor screening, cross-validation, and model selection) that are accomplished through simple commands allowing for extremely flexible model tuning, tailored to the needs of users requiring an easy interface for different levels of experimental complexity. As part of the open-source climate4R framework, downscaleR is freely available and the necessary data and R scripts to fully replicate the experiments included in this paper are also provided as a companion notebook. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

How do affected forest-dependent households perceive their roles in sustainable forest management and REDD+ and how do these perceptions and attitudes influence the (potential) socio-ecological performance of REDD+? Two communes consisting of forest-dependent and indigenous communities in Central Vietnam were selected for this study–the former involved in the UN-REDD program and the latter involved in a REDD+ program of Fauna and Flora International (FFI). Here, we differentiated between a ‘do no harm’ and pro-carbon (UN-REDD), and pro-poor (FFI-REDD+) approach to REDD+. Employing an applied socio-ecological systems framework, we conducted household surveys (n = 102) and we adopted qualitative research methods. This study identified the importance of traditional ecological knowledge systems in sustainable forest management. While pro-poor REDD+ was more inclusive, both REDD+ programs in our study were implemented in a top down manner.

Italy still lacks a national regulation about odors, but several regions issued specific guidelines and regulations regarding odor emissions management, which combine olfactometric measurements with dispersion modeling for assessing odor impacts and verifying compliance with acceptability criteria. However, in cases of variable or diffuse sources, this approach is sometimes hardly applicable, because odor emission rates can hardly be estimated. In such cases, electronic noses, or more generally, Instrumental Odor Monitoring Systems (IOMS), represent a suitable solution for direct odor measurement. Accordingly, IOMS are explicitly mentioned in the most recent regional regulations as advanced tools for odor impact assessment. In Italy, data from instrumental odor monitoring have started to have regulatory value; thus the need arises to have specific quality programs to ensure and verify the reliability of IOMS outcomes. This paper describes the monitoring by a commercial electronic nose (EOS507F) of odors from an area dedicated to tire storage, a diffuse source with variable emissions over time, for which dispersion modeling is not applicable. The paper proposes also a protocol for IOMS performance testing in the field, to provide experimental data to support technical groups working on standardization both on the national and European level. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality; E-nose; IOMS; Minimum requirements; Odor emissions; Odor impact assessment; Sensor arrays; Technical standards","Digital storage; Dispersions; Monitoring; Odor control; Acceptability criterion; Commercial electronics; Dispersion modeling; Environmental concerns; Odor emission rate; Odor impact assessments; Performance testing; Suitable solutions; Electronic nose; emission; monitoring; odor; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085129955

The impact of soil fauna on these processes is poorly known. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of earthworms on organic matter (OM) decomposition and association with minerals during a laboratory experiment. We used a model system consisting of fresh OM incubated with and without epigeic earthworms (Eisenia andrei and foetida) in presence of different types and amounts of phyllosilicates (kaolinite, montmorillonite) and an iron oxide (goethite) and combinations of these minerals. Our experimental setup included a high OM:mineral ratio to represent the soil-litter interphase. We monitored OC mineralisation during 196 days. Additionally, we investigated physicochemical parameters and chemical OM characteristics of decomposition products by determination of water-soluble OC (WSOC) and acquisition of solid-state 13C NMR spectra. We also analysed microscale organisation of the organo-mineral associations produced with and without earthworms by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Earthworms enhanced OC mineralisation in all treatments. They also led to greater reductions of OC emissions in the presence of minerals as compared to the mineral-free control, depending on the type and amount of minerals added. The presence of earthworms affected microbial biomass, the concentration of WSOC and increased the contribution of aromatic compounds to OM decomposition products. Microscale analyses by TEM showed that earthworms favoured association of minerals with partly degraded OM along with completely degraded material, while in absence of earthworms only completely degraded OM was associated with minerals. We conclude that earthworms impact OM decomposition through (1) their effect on microbial biomass and the physicochemical parameters of microbial habitat and (2) the formation of OM associations by changing the OM types associated to minerals and possibly by creating closer association of partly degraded OM and iron oxides. The stability of these associations remains to be investigated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon sequestration; Clay-sized minerals; Earthworms; Organo-mineral associations","Animals; Biogeochemistry; Forestry; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Iron oxides; Kaolinite; Mineralogy; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Organic carbon; Silicates; Soils; Carbon sequestration; Decomposition products; Earthworms; Laboratory experiments; Micro-scale analysis; Mineral associations; Organic matter decomposition; Physicochemical parameters; Organic minerals; biomass; carbon sequestration; clay mineral; earthworm; iron oxide; organic matter; physicochemical property; soil fauna; Eisenia andrei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079355794

It has also presented a unique project to study the temporalities of local content. With the majority of investment expected to occur in the construction phase that is estimated to be completed in two to three years, there appears to be a short term ‘window of opportunity’ for companies and labour alike to participate. Focusing solely on the Tanzanian portion of the pipeline and using fieldwork in Dar es Salaam and Tanga from June 2017 to August 2018, before the suspension of the project, this paper argues that the temporary nature of EACOP resulted in the construction of urgencies to establish a comprehensive local content sector.

It offers benefits like efficient and sustainable energy supply, reduced carbon emission, deferring extension of power distribution infrastructures, and so on. However, integration of DGs having different characteristics results in various operational challenges in a MG network. One of which is power quality (PQ) issue. Hence, in this article, impact of PQ issues in an adopted standalone MG system (comprising of solar, wind and fuel cell based DGs) is investigated in the presence of shunt active power filter (SAPF). The realization of SAPF is carried out using conventional synchronous reference frame (SRF) and modified SRF (MSRF) techniques for reference current generation, proportional integral (PI) controller, and fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for DC-link capacitor voltage regulation and a basic hysteresis band current controller technique for generation of switching pulse for the inverter. The simulation model of conventional SRF/MSRF techniques and the proposed FLC approach based SAPF is developed under MATLAB/SIMULINKR environment both at ideal and nonideal source condition considering inductive and capacitive load. The results obtained using proposed MSRF technique and FLC approach owing to different load scenarios is compared to that of conventional SRF and MSRF technique with PI controller. The comparative results obtained validate the superiority of proposed technique over other related to harmonics elimination and DC-link capacitor voltage regulation. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","distributed generation; harmonics; microgrid; power quality; shunt active power filter","Controllers; Distributed power generation; Fuel cells; Fuzzy logic; MATLAB; Passive filters; Power quality; Two term control systems; Voltage regulators; harmonics; Hysteresis band current controller; Micro grid; Proportional integral controllers; Reference current generation; Shunt active power filter (SAPF); Shunt active power filters; Synchronous reference frame; Electric power system control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076718692

Species misidentification within the genus has hampered efforts to manage their spread and impact, and thus Pomacea maculata have received much less attention that P. canaliculata. Species Distribution Models are well suited for a global screening for suitable regions for the establishment of apple snails. Here, a global distribution model for the distribution of P. maculata based on an extensive database allowed us to identify current and future potential receptor freshwater ecoregions (FEOws) and to set priorities for the development of early warning strategies under climate change scenarios. Model performance was adequate, predicting accurately most invaded FEOWs across the world. Performing a global balance for climate change scenarios, and considering only FEOWs with medium and high ecoregional susceptibility (ES), the potential native distribution of P. maculata is reduced in ca. 945,701 km2, while the exotic potential distribution area increases in 1,118,111 km2. To minimize risks of future invasions, uninvaded FEOWs with both high values of ES and a predicted increase in environmental quality for the establishment of P. maculata were identified across the globe. The development of early warning schemes aiming to detect the initial phase of invasions may provide a unique opportunity for control of this highly invasive species before a much damage to the socio-ecological system is inflicted. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","ampullaridae; exotic species; predictive species distribution models; risk management","ecoregion; freshwater ecosystem; geographical distribution; invasibility; invasive species; nature conservation; performance assessment; snail; spatial distribution; Ampullariidae; Gastropoda; Malus x domestica; Pomacea; Pomacea canaliculata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087124932

Here, we attempt to disentangle the confounding effects of anthropogenic climate change and natural variability on observed increases in fire danger in France over the past six decades, with a focus on the fire-prone Mediterranean region. Daily fire weather and fire-related drought indices were computed from a reanalyses dataset covering the 1958–2017 period. Anthropogenic signals in meteorological variables were isolated using 17 climate models and then removed from observations to form a set of counterfactual observations free of anthropogenic climate change. Our results show that anthropogenic climate change is responsible for nearly half of the long-term increases in fire weather and fire-related drought conditions across the Mediterranean region and have significantly elevated the likelihood of summers with extreme fire danger. Fire danger conditions such as those observed during the near-record breaking 2003 fire season have a <0.2% annual probability (return interval >500 years) of occurrence in the absence of anthropogenic climate change, compared to a probability of ~10% (return interval ~10 years) under today's climate accounting for anthropogenic climate change. Our approach provides modernized estimates of current fire danger levels and expected return levels of extreme fire seasons considering climate change, which may help inform fire management agencies and decision making. © Copyright © 2020 Barbero, Abatzoglou, Pimont, Ruffault and Curt.","climate change; detection and attribution; fire weather index; France; Mediterranean","Climate models; Decision making; Drought; Fires; Annual probabilities; Anthropogenic climate; Anthropogenic climate changes; Anthropogenic signals; Evaporative demands; Mediterranean region; Meteorological variables; Natural variability; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084063731

A major element of this mission is the strategic storage of six critical commodities located at warehouses across the globe. A rapid needs assessment is necessary for determining the commodity types and amounts, which the agency then transports to the disaster location to be distributed to the affected population by partner organizations on the ground. Currently, the entire commodity shipment is sent via a chartered aircraft, obtained through an emergency bid process, to a target airfield for transfer to the distributing organization. Incremental commodity delivery is a potential strategy that would support decision efficiency. Based on the demand on the ground, shipments can be scheduled and sent when they are truly needed, using a variety of transport modes. The agency can reduce financial cost (transportation expenses) and carbon cost (environmental impact) while decreasing port inventory saturation that occurs when the number of commodities delivered exceeds the partner organizations' distribution capacity. The incremental approach requires complex decision-making to assess available transport options and their financial and carbon efficiencies while meeting target arrival dates/times for each shipment. This project produced a decision support tool that uses historical and GIS data to project sequences of commodity increments and shipment alternatives that meet target arrival times. Users can then conduct informed tradeoff and scenario analyses during their decision process for specific disaster relief operations. The tool presents alternatives based upon four categories of constraints: delivery timing, cost efficiency, carbon efficiency, and the inventory capacity of the arrival port. User inputs include the commodity types and amounts to be delivered, the timeline within which they must arrive, and the target arrival port. The model utilizes multi-objective network optimization to present the potential tradeoffs between the current delivery strategy and the method of incremental shipments timed to meet commodity distribution rates. The tool may identify options that are more functionally and financially beneficial to the agency, its beneficiaries (i.e., more commodities can be provided if transportation costs decrease), and the distributing partners. It can also support an increase in environmentally conscious decisions, which is a growing priority in the humanitarian emergency community. The tool can also be adapted to meet the needs of similar organizations to support their decision-making pertaining to disaster supply chain management. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Aircraft accidents; Carbon; Costs; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Disaster prevention; Efficiency; Emergency services; Environmental impact; Ships; Supply chain management; Decision support tools; Disaster relief operations; Distribution capacity; Government agencies; Incremental approach; Inventory capacity; Network optimization; Transportation cost; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087080426

However, this ‘Blue Carbon’ potential has been only evaluated for certain species from some areas of the world. In this study, we provide initial estimates on the magnitude and local variability of carbon sequestration, as organic carbon stocks, for seagrass meadows of Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Ascherson in the oceanic island of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain, central-eastern Atlantic). Six seagrass meadows were selected; at each meadow, cores inserted up to 30 cm in the seabed were collected in the ‘interior’, ‘edge’ and ‘unvegetated’ bottoms immediately adjacent to seagrass patches. We estimated organic carbon (Corg) pools by means of the Loss of Ignition (LOI) procedure. Overall, larger Corg pools were observed in the ‘interior’ and 'edges' of meadow patches than in adjacent ‘unvegetated’ bottoms. At the meadow-level, Corg pools were not predicted neither by the meadow area, nor by the mean shoot density, or sediment grain fractions. Overall, the total estimated stock was 86.20 ± 19.06 Mg C ha−1. By considering the total potential extension of seagrass meadows across the entire island perimeter, we estimated a total stock of 60.34 Gg of C, for a mean estimated financial value of 919,432.249 € (1313.47 € ha−1), which ranges between 351,631.35 € (502.33 € ha−1) and 1,498,954.45 € (2141.36 € ha−1), according to varying market prices in the last 5 years. This work highlights, therefore, the importance of meadows underpinned by C. nodosa not only at an ecological, but also at an economic level, in particular from the perspective of regional climate change adaptation strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Blue carbon; Canary islands; Carbon sinks; Seagrass meadows; Valuation","Climate change; Ecosystems; Lakes; Plants (botany); Resource valuation; Canary islands; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sink; Economic valuation; Ecosystem services; Regional climate changes; Seagrass meadows; Spatial variations; Organic carbon; adaptive management; carbon sink; meadow; organic carbon; prediction; regional climate; seagrass meadow; source-sink dynamics; spatial variation; valuation; Atlantic Coast [Europe]; Atlantic Coast [Spain]; Canary Islands; Gran Canaria; Las Palmas; Spain; Cymodocea nodosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078777680

However, in order to have confidence in earth observation data, measurements made at the surface of the Earth, with the intention of providing verification or validation of satellite-mounted sensor measurements, should be trustworthy and at least of the same high quality as those taken with the satellite sensors themselves. Metrology tells us that in order to be trustworthy, measurements should include an unbroken chain of SI-traceable calibrations and comparisons and full uncertainty budgets for each of the in situ sensors. Until now, this has not been the case for most satellite validation measurements. Therefore, within this context, the European Space Agency (ESA) funded a series of Fiducial Reference Measurements (FRM) projects targeting the validation of satellite data products of the atmosphere, land, and ocean, and setting the framework, standards, and protocols for future satellite validation efforts. The FRM4SOC project was structured to provide this support for evaluating and improving the state of the art in ocean colour radiometry (OCR) and satellite ocean colour validation through a series of comparisons under the auspices of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). This followed the recommendations from the International Ocean Colour Coordinating Group's white paper and supports the CEOS ocean colour virtual constellation. The main objective was to establish and maintain SI traceable ground-based FRM for satellite ocean colour and thus make a fundamental contribution to the European system for monitoring the Earth (Copernicus). This paper outlines the FRM4SOC project structure, objectives and methodology and highlights the main results and achievements of the project: (1) An international SI-traceable comparison of irradiance and radiance sources used for OCR calibration that set measurement, calibration and uncertainty estimation protocols and indicated good agreement between the participating calibration laboratories from around the world; (2) An international SI-traceable laboratory and outdoor comparison of radiometers used for satellite ocean colour validation that set OCR calibration and comparison protocols; (3) A major review and update to the protocols for taking irradiance and radiance field measurements for satellite ocean colour validation, with particular focus on aspects of data acquisition and processing that must be considered in the estimation of measurement uncertainty and guidelines for good practice; (4) A technical comparison of the main radiometers used globally for satellite ocean colour validation bringing radiometer manufacturers together around the same table for the first time to discuss instrument characterisation and its documentation, as needed for measurement uncertainty estimation; (5) Two major international side-by-side field intercomparisons of multiple ocean colour radiometers, one on the Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) oceanographic cruise, and the other on the Acqua Alta oceanographic tower in the Gulf of Venice; (6) Impact and promotion of FRM within the ocean colour community, including a scientific road map for the FRM-based future of satellite ocean colour validation and vicarious calibration (based on the findings of the FRM4SOC project, the consensus from two major international FRM4SOC workshops and previous literature, including the IOCCG white paper on in situ ocean colour radiometry). © 2020 by the author.","Calibration and validation; Committee for earth observation satellites (CEOS); Copernicus; European space agency (ESA); Fiducial reference measurements (FRM); Satellite ocean colour; SI traceability and uncertainty","Budget control; Calibration; Climate change; Color; Data acquisition; Data handling; Earth (planet); In situ processing; Observatories; Oceanography; Radiometers; Radiometry; Satellites; Space applications; Atlantic Meridional Transect; Calibration laboratories; Earth observation data; Earth observation satellites; Measurement uncertainty; Reference measurements; Uncertainty estimation; Validation of satellite datum; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084590011

In these cities, most people choose their transportation mode according to corresponding utility including traveller's and trip's characteristics. Also, there is no effective solution in terms of population growth, urban space, and transportation demands, so it is essential to optimize systematically travel demands in the real network of roads in urban areas, especially in congested areas. Travel Demand Management (TDM) is one of the well-known ways to solve these problems. TDM defined as a strategy that aims to maximize the efficiency of the urban transport system by granting certain privileges for public transportation modes, Enforcement on the private car traffic prohibition in specific places or times, increase in the cost of using certain facilities like parking in congested areas. Network pricing is one of the most effective methods of managing transportation demands for reducing traffic and controlling air pollution especially in the crowded parts of downtown. A little paper may exist that optimize urban transportations in busy parts of cities with combined Markov decision making processes with reward and evolutionary-based algorithms and simultaneously considering customers' and trip's characteristics. Therefore, we present a new network traffic management for urban cities that optimizes a multi-objective function that related to the expected value of the Markov decision system's reward using the Genetic Algorithm. The planned Shiraz city is taken as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of the proposed approach. At first, an analysis is also performed on the impact of the toll levels on the variation of the user and operator cost components, respectively. After choosing suitable values for the network parameters, simulation of the Markov decision process and GA is dynamically performed, then the optimal decision for the Markov decision process in terms of total reward is obtained. The results illustrate that the proposed cordon pricing has significant improvement in performance for all seasons including spring, autumn, and winter. © 2020 Warsaw University of Technology.

Thus, low-impact development (LID) practices have frequently been suggested as adaptation strategies to local climate change. Studies have demonstrated the potential effects of LID, but they have not quantified and verified the extent of its capacity to mitigate the effects of actual floods. Therefore, this study set up catchment-scale sites located at the boundary where rainwater is treated in an urban area and evaluated the impacts of two types of LID using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) based on actual flood events during the wet season. The results showed that LID could reduce the runoff volume, peak flow, and inundation volume compared with conventional development. This study also used and demonstrated the implications of sensitivity testing and model updating to increase the correlation between the real system and the modeled site; therefore, the results can be used as a reference to assess the effectiveness of green space when planning urban redevelopment and regeneration projects where sewer systems already exist. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Low impact development (LID); Parameter estimation and model updating; SWMM; Urban flood",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076825108

Populations are fragmented at the southern edge of their distribution due to suboptimal habitat conditions. Facilitating gene flow may improve population resilience through genetic and demographic rescue. We used a multiscale approach to estimate the relationship between genetic connectivity and landscape characteristics among individuals at three scales in the northeastern United States: regional, subregional, and local. We integrated multiple modeling techniques and identified top models based on consensus. Top models were used to parameterize resistance surfaces at each scale, and circuit theory was used to identify potential movement corridors. Regional gene flow was affected by forest cover, elevation, developed land cover, and slope. At subregional and local scales, the effects were site specific and included subsets of temperature, elevation, developed land cover, and slope. Developed land cover significantly affected gene flow at each scale. At finer scales, lack of variance in forest cover may have limited the ability to detect a relationship with gene flow. The effect of slope on gene flow was positive or negative, depending on the site examined. Occupancy probability was a relatively poor predictor, and we caution its use as a proxy for landscape resistance.

In this paper, we use bulk deposition and stream water measurements in the central Pyrenees (PYR-C and PYR-AT sites) and Montseny (MSY-TM0) covering different time lengths in the period 1983–2017 to investigate how these mountain environments respond to ongoing changes of regional emissions to the atmosphere. PYR-C, in spite of its position far away from urban and industrial areas, presented higher SO4–S, NO3–N and NH4–N bulk deposition than the Montseny site closer to Barcelona and the inclusion of dry deposition only reversed this pattern for NO3–N. This indicates that distance to pollution sources does not protect these mountain sites from a considerable impact of pollution. Time-trends in SO4 2- and NO3 – concentrations in bulk deposition were similar between sites: SO4 2- monotonically decreased, while NO3 – increased until the mid-2000 s and decreased thereafter. In the period 1983 to 2017, SO2 emissions in Europe (EU-28) decreased by 95%, while in the SO4 2- concentrations in bulk deposition declined by 35–50% in Pyrenees and Montseny respectively and SO4 2- concentrations in the streams by 25–35%, respectively. Other sources of SO4 2- (e.g. episodic African dust) may explain the different reduction rate between anthropogenic emissions and bulk deposition. Net S budget was positive for MSY-TM0 (indicating flushing from the catchment) and negative for the PYR-C site (indicating retention), while it was close to zero for the other Pyrenean site, but in the PYR-C site net retention showed a significant increasing trend tending to lower retention in recent years. Bulk N deposition in the Pyrenees was lower but stream concentrations and export was higher than at Montseny, this leading to less N retention in the Pyrenean sites. However, the MSY-TM0 site showed a trend towards less N retention in recent years. This was driven by higher exports during the wet months, which would correspond to a first stage of N saturation according Stoddard's classification. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Atmospheric deposition; Emissions; Mountain ecosystems; Nitrogen; Stream water chemistry; Sulfur","Air pollution; Atmospheric chemistry; Budget control; Catchments; Deposition; Forestry; Landforms; Meteorological problems; Nitrogen; Particulate emissions; Sulfur; Urban growth; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric depositions; Ecological effect; Iberian Peninsula; Mountain ecosystems; Pollution sources; Streamwater chemistry; Sulfur depositions; River pollution; nitrate; nitrogen; sulfate; sulfur; water; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission; mountain stream; nitrogen; pollutant source; sulfur; water chemistry; air pollution control; Article; atmospheric deposition; bulk deposition; central Pyrenees; classification; climate; Europe; geographic and geological phenomena; geographic names; metabolism; Montseny; mountain; nitrogen deposition; nitrogen saturation; pollution; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); retention time; seasonal variation; Spain; Stoddard classification; stream chemistry; sulfur deposition; time; trend study; urban area; vegetation; volume; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Iberian Peninsula; Montseny; Pyrenees; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076624071

Rural communities are recognised as one of the most vulnerable populations to climate change. The majority of research to date is quantitative and has a focus on farmers specifically, with the impacts of climate change on the wider rural community considered to a lesser extent. Our study addresses this gap by analyzing qualitative data from the Australian Rural Mental Health Study (ARMHS), a longitudinal study conducted in non-metropolitan New South Wales (NSW), Australia, during the Millennium Drought. Free text responses from 823 participants to the open-ended question “What is your biggest concern about climate change?” were analysed to determine what the qualitative data from ARMHS reveals about the mental health and wellbeing of rural communities. Four themes were identified: (i) suffering under climate change; (ii) causes of climate change; (iii) extremes of climate change; and (iv) leadership and action to address climate change. The environmental, financial, health and social impacts of climate change were of greatest concern to rural residents. Many participants also had concerns relating to climate change attribution, with many believing climate change was a natural, cyclical process not caused by human actions. Other major concerns were the financial consequences of extreme events and the adequate communication of climate change information. Analysis of qualitative data such as that presented here gives context and breadth of understanding to issues identified via quantitative analysis. Importantly, insights emerging from qualitative data, and the personal/community context that is not always available from quantitative data, can lead to more informed community-based approaches to addressing climate change issues experienced by vulnerable populations. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change; Place; Qualitative; Rural; Wellbeing","climate change; health impact; health risk; mental health; metropolitan area; qualitative analysis; rural population; vulnerability; Australia; New South Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079430704

Although increase in traffic volume and duration of traffic congestion has been significantly recognized in Yangon, research conducted on traffic-related air pollutants is very limited. In this study, we mainly focused on nitrogen dioxide and aromatic hydrocarbons of VOCs; benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes collectively known as BTEX. Dffusive air samplers; DSD-CX for BTEX and DSD-TEA for NO2 were placed at seven sampling sites, S1-S4 located on heavy congested traffic roads of commercial areas and S5-S7 on fast moving traffic roads of residential ones. The BTEX concentrations were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and NO2 by ion chromatography. According to the findings, we concluded that roadside NO2 concentrations reflect the severity of traffic congestion currently encountered in the city. Sources other than vehicle emission could also have contribution to roadside traffic-related pollutants.

We hypothesize that countries will have prepared the NDCs strategically such that they reinforce national development agendas. This, we argue, makes sense for countries trying to tackle many social, economic and environmental challenges simultaneously and with limited resources. Examining seven Small Island Developing States (SIDS), we compare the priorities described in their NDCs with those in their national development plans. We find most NDC actions relate generally to themes in the respective national development plan, but the range of sectors they include as climate priorities is narrow and does not reflect the spread of national development agendas. Those sectors most emphasised by SIDS’ development plans–governance and institutions, economic management, education, health, transport and land use planning–tend not to be included in NDCs at all. This is surprising for adaptation priorities, given the necessity of addressing not only climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, water and coastal zone management but of also tackling the contextual conditions that make communities vulnerable in the first place. We suggest these patterns may be the result of normative and/or material biases that shape thinking about which sectors are climate-relevant. This is limiting the positive reinforcement that NDCs might otherwise give to development agendas, and is a missed opportunity for policy coherence and greater resilience building. Key policy insights The NDCs provide an opportunity for countries to identify climate actions that also strengthen their sustainable development agendas, which would incentivize their implementation and strengthen the NDC concept going forward. The way adaptation priorities are being defined in the NDCs of SIDS appears limited to a narrow range of sectors that are sensitive to climate impacts. Broadening the way adaptation priorities are identified would, going forward, likely create stronger synergies between the NDCs and national development plans, and would also improve climate resilience outcomes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; climate policy; NDCs; sustainable development","adaptive management; bottom-up approach; environmental policy; incentive; national planning; policy approach; policy implementation; small island state; sustainable development; synergism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065158541

Leaf area index “LAI” and leaf area density “LADz” of any tree are two major parameters that allow us to predict the tree’s climatic impact. Hence, urban planners and designers need to calculate LAI and LADz for use in urban climatic studies. Unfortunately, despite the clear need for urban trees in an arid climate such as that of Egypt, very little data is available for these two parameters. Therefore, to study the microclimate changes that a tree canopy can cause within its urban built environment, a guideline for estimating LAI and LADz values for the trees was created to generate a database that can be used as an input data for outdoor thermal simulation programs. A developed method that mixes between direct and indirect measurements used to calculate LAI values for the most common urban trees in Cairo “Ficus nitida, Delonix regia and Morus alba”, which also allowed us to find LADz values that are necessary for running ENVI-met simulations. After studying these trees’ canopy parameters and determining their respective LAI and LADz values, we concluded that Delonix reiga has the highest LAI and LADz values compared to the other two trees. Afterwards, simulating four different scenarios by using these trees to prove the effect of tree canopy; the more LAI and LAD values tree generate “more dense trees canopies”, the more impact on microclimate. © 2020, Cairo University.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a model for estimate and analyze energy consumption and CO2 emissions from urban transportation systems using the system dynamics approach. To demonstrate the application of the model, Chiang Mai city has been taken as a practical case. The proposed model comprised of five subsystems including population, economy, transport supply, vehicle, and energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The validation of a proposed model revealed that this model was reliable to estimate CO2 emissions and analyze the reduction policy for the city level.

Characterization of operational zones and depths that are sensitive for N transformation is crucial for site specific N management. N fertilization in oil palm cultivation caused the inorganic N susceptible to losses through leaching and gasses emission. In order to understand nitrification in peat oil palm cultivation, specific area and depth that are susceptible to nitrification need to be characterized. Peat soil from three operational zones namely weeded circle (WC); frond heap (FH) and harvesting path (HP) was sampled up to six depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-45, 45-60 and &gt;60 cm) in an oil palm plantation in Perak, Malaysia. The samples was analyzed for potential nitrification rate (PNR), ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) concentration. Results showed nitrification was found to be concentrated in the top soil WC zone as shown by the PNR (0.367 - 0.48 mg N kg-1day-1). Deeper soil layer (&gt;30cm for WC and &gt;10 cm for both HP and FH) unable to show positive nitrification in PNR. Therefore, it can be assumed that most nitrifiers community are concentrated on the topsoil. It is also assumed that nitrate availability in the subsoil originated from vertical movements from the topsoil. Therefore it is believed nitrification in cultivated peat soil was concentrated in surface and fertilized soil due to favorable condition -lower moisture content and available substrate. © 2020 Plant Archives.

The strategies are mainly based on extensive electrification employing renewable electricity, storage, and sector-coupling strategies. We perform energy, economic, and resilience analyses for the different cases. An energy balance model with 1-h resolution is used to optimize the energy system on macro-scale, while a MILP-algorithm is used for micro-level optimization of operation of individual plants against different criteria. The results indicate that a zero-carbon energy system is feasible by 2050, but it would also require coupling to the exogenous energy system (national electricity market) to balance mismatches. Power-to-heat coupling, or storage alone would not be adequate. As an example of system dynamics limitations, with a wind power capacity of 1.5 GW corresponding to 56% of the annual electricity demand in Helsinki, 90% of the wind electricity can be used locally in the different sectors, but the rest needs coupling to the exogenous market due to mismatch and plant limitations. The decarbonization strategies with increasing variable renewable energy production generally improve the resilience of the energy system, but with some concerns to adequacy of peak production and electricity dependency of heating. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Renewable energy; Resilience; System modelling; Urban energy systems; Zero-carbon energy systems","alternative energy; carbon emission; electricity; electricity industry; electrification; energy market; energy storage; heating; strategic approach; urban area; wind power; Article; carbonization; electric power plant; electricity; energy balance; energy yield; renewable energy; urban area; wind power; Finland; Helsinki; Varsinais-Suomi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078556037

Several hypothetical scenarios of CO2 migration in a leaky fault, and thief zones at different depths at the Kimberlina site (California, USA) constitute the basis of the approach. The CO2 displacement is simulated using the TOUGH2 simulator applied to a detailed geological model of the site. The gravity responses to these CO2 plumes are simulated using forward modeling with sensors at ground surface and in vertical boreholes. Results of inversion on one scenario are also presented. The surface-based gravity responses obtained for the different leakage scenarios demonstrate that leakage can be detected at the surface in all the scenarios but the time to detection is highly variable (10–40 years) and dependent on the detection threshold considered. Borehole measurements of the vertical component of gravity provide excellent constraints in depth when they are located in proximity of the density anomaly associated with the presence of CO2, thus discriminating multiple leaks in different thief zones. Joint inversion of surface and borehole data can bring valuable information of the occurrence of leakages and their importance by providing a reasonable estimate of mass of displaced fluids. This study demonstrates the importance of combining multiphase flow simulations with gravity modeling in order to define if and when gravity monitoring would be applicable at a given storage site. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CCS; Geologic CO2 storage; Kimberlina; Leak detection; Time-lapse gravity monitoring","Boreholes; Digital storage; Leak detection; Borehole measurements; CO2 storage; Detection threshold; Geological modeling; Gravity monitoring; Kimberlina; Time-lapse gravity; Vertical component; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; detection method; fault; gravity field; leakage; numerical model; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078125076

Due to their deleterious effects on living organisms, Cu and arsenic (As) have gained global attention, and thus their monitoring in the environment is an important task. The aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate the alteration of soil enzyme activities (EAs) and soil microbial functional diversity with Cu/As contamination, and 2) to select the most reliable biochemical indicators of Cu/As contamination. A twelve-week soil experiment was performed with four increasing levels of Cu, As, and Cu/As from 150/15 to 1000/100 mg Cu/As kg−1. Soil enzyme activities and soil community-level physiological profile (CLPP) using MicroResp™ were measured during the experiment. Results showed reduced EAs over time with increasing Cu and Cu/As levels. The most Cu-sensitive EAs were dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, and arylsulfatase, while arginine ammonification might be related to the resilience of soil microbial communities due to its increased activity in the last experimental times. There was no consistent response to As contamination with reduced individual EAs at specific sampling times, being urease the only EA negatively affected by As. MicroResp™ showed reduced carbon (C) substrate utilization with increasing Cu levels indicating a community shift in C acquisition. These results support the use of specific EAs to assess the environmental impact of specific HMs, being also the first assessment of EAs and the use of CLPP (MicroResp™) to study the environmental impact in Cu/As contaminated soils. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Biochemical properties; Ecotoxicology; Heavy metals; metal(loid)s; Physiological profile; Toxic elements","acid phosphatase; arginine; arsenic; arylsulfatase; carbon; copper; oxidoreductase; acid phosphatase; arsenic; arylsulfatase; copper; oxidoreductase; urease; arsenic; biochemical composition; concentration (composition); copper; ecotoxicology; enzyme activity; heavy metal; metalloid; soil pollution; ammonification; Article; biochemistry; controlled study; environmental impact; enzyme activity; microbial diversity; nonhuman; reduction (chemistry); soil microflora; soil pollution; chemistry; metabolism; microbiology; pharmacology; soil; soil pollutant; Acid Phosphatase; Arsenic; Arylsulfatases; Copper; Oxidoreductases; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Urease",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078725803

Biodiesel is otherwise referred as “neat” fuel. It is a fuel derived from a chemical reaction of alcohol (methyl, ethyl, butyl, propyl, isopropyl) and vegetable or animal oils, fats, or greases. These oils or fats are chemically altered in order to use in any diesel engine, with little or no modification. A process called transesterification removes the glycerin component of the oil (which is a triglyceride molecule), resulting in a much thinner, or less viscous product, which stays down to much lower temperatures. It significantly reduces harmful pollutants, as well as carbon dioxide gas and reduces our vehicles contribution to climate change. Current oil and gas reserves are sufficing to last only a few more decades. The scarcity of known petroleum reserves will make renewable energy sources more attractive. To meet the rising energy demand and replace petroleum reserves, fuels, natural gas etc., Biodiesel is in the forefront of alternative technologies. The first record of Biodiesel usage was in 31st August 1937, by the University of Brussels, Belgium who conducted transesterification of vegetable oil using ethanol in order to separate the fatty acids from glycerol by replacing the glycerol with short liner alcohols. More recently Renault and Peugeot have approved the use of biodiesel in some of their own truck engines. In 1991, the European Community (EC) proposed a 90% tax deduction for the use of biofuels, including biodiesel. Now a days each of the plant are producing up to &gt;1.5 billion gallons of fuel per year. The European Union accounted for nearly 89% of all biodiesel production worldwide in 2005.

In this paper, we use ground-based observations to address the large uncertainties in the source-resolved emission estimation of carbonaceous aerosols. Ambient fine fraction aerosol was collected on filters at the high-altitude (2590ma.s.l.) Rwanda Climate Observatory (RCO), a SSA background site, during the dry and wet seasons in 2014 and 2015. The concentrations of both the carbonaceous and inorganic ion components show a strong seasonal cycle, with highly elevated concentrations during the dry season. Source marker ratios, including carbon isotopes, show that the wet and dry seasons have distinct aerosol compositions. The dry season is characterized by elevated amounts of biomass burning products, which approach ~ 95% for carbonaceous aerosols. An isotopic mass-balance estimate shows that the amount of the carbonaceous aerosol stemming from savanna fires may increase from 0.2 μgm-3 in the wet season up to 10 μgm-3 during the dry season. Based on these results, we quantitatively show that savanna fire is the key modulator of the seasonal aerosol composition variability at the RCO. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

Changes in physico-chemical and biological soil properties in 15 harvest-created gaps under single-tree selection and the adjacent closed canopies, with five replications for each, were studied 6 years after gap creation in an oriental beech (Fagus orientalis L.) stand of the Hyrcanian forest. Gaps were classified into three size classes: small (85-130 m2), medium (131-175 m2) and large (176-300 m2). Soil cores were collected at the center and at the edge of gaps, and under the adjacent closed canopy. Results indicated that gap size significantly affected soil texture and bulk density, whereas soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen and pH showed a significant gradient from the center to the edge of gap independently form their size. SOC and total nitrogen at the center of gaps were also significantly lower than closed-canopy, in particular for the medium-gap; contrastingly, the bulk density with the highest mean value was found at the center of the large-gap. Gap size had no significant influence on soil microbial biomass. These results highlighted that similar conditions in terms of many soil properties were still present among gaps and adjacent closed-canopy stands six years after logging, though canopy openness triggered a reduction in carbon and nitrogen availability along with the related microbial activity at the center of gaps, independently from their size. Therefore, if aimed at preserving an uneven aged structure along with soil quality in temperate broadleaved deciduous forest as the oriental beech stands in the Hyrcanian region, single-tree selection practice for harvesting trees can be recommended as sustainable forest management type. © SISEF.","Artificial gap; Oriental beech; Soil properties; Temperate forests",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083999391

When analysing eddy-covariance-based flux measurements for management and weather related drivers, this is commonly done by comparing either different measurement years at one site or data from different sites distributed regionally or globally. However this procedure makes it usually difficult to clearly attribute observed differences in the carbon exchange to management effects or meteorological drivers. In this study we present results of the carbon and GHG budget of a 10-year paired grassland field experiment in Switzerland comparing intensive and extensive management. We focus on the inter-annual variability of the entire 10-year dataset and especially on the effect of a renovation activity in the intensive field after seven years. By comparing the results of the paired plots, we attempted to disentangle the effects of management including renovation from the effect of seasonal weather conditions on the carbon and greenhouse gas budget. The annual carbon budgets of the two paired fields showed clear systematic differences attributable to the different management. The inter-annual variation (IAV) of the carbon budget was determined as residuals from linear trends. Due to the high correlation of the IAV between the two parallel fields, it was assigned mainly to variations in seasonal weather conditions. The total range of weather attributed variations of annual NECB values was similar in magnitude to the systematic management induced difference between the two fields (100–200 gC m−2 yr-1). In contrast to previous studies on grassland renovation, a large net carbon loss and enhanced N2O emission over 2–3 years was observed here. The excess N2O emission after renovation could be well explained by the IPCC default emission factor approach when considering the additional N input by plant residues and the net soil organic matter mineralisation. Concerning the total GHG budget effect the cumulated GHG uptake by the INT field in the first six years of the experiment was more than compensated by the release in the three post-renovation years. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon budget; Grassland management; Greenhouse gas budget; Inter-annual variations; N2O emissions","annual variation; carbon budget; climate change; climate conditions; grassland; nitrous oxide; soil organic matter; terrestrial ecosystem; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077659620

To help mitigate such risk and increase food security, international development agencies have invested billions of dollars in climate-smart agriculture (CSA) programs over the past decade. However, rigorous evidence on the food security impacts of CSA aid through crop yields remains scant generally, and specifically in sub-Saharan Africa. Most studies have not explicitly linked CSA adoption and yield impacts with CSA aid interventions among smallholder farmers. Here, we respond to this knowledge gap by estimating the impact of a major CSA aid effort (the United States Agency for International Development-funded Wellness and Agriculture for Life's Advancement (WALA) project) on agricultural yields in Southern Malawi. Based on primary survey data from a sample of 808 households in the project area, we use endogenous switching regression and a control function approach to estimate CSA adoption and impacts on maize yield in 2016, controlling for potential program placement bias, selection bias in CSA adoption, and endogeneity issues. We found a 53% increase in maize yield among CSA adopters in the drought year of 2016. Results demonstrate that policies and funding streams supporting CSA in low-income, dryland contexts such as southern Malawi can have important impacts on food security by boosting crop yields in the face of increasing climate uncertainty and extreme weather shocks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate finance; Climate-smart agriculture; Food security; Maize yield; Malawi","agricultural economics; agricultural policy; aid flow; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; developing world; food security; investment; low income population; maize; risk assessment; Malawi; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081360500

The prime factors, namely population size, percentage of urbanization, percentage of agricultural land, and average years of schooling, were used in the analysis. The research further examines the existing policies that regulate carbon emission in EU states. The analysis covers 25 EU member countries for the years from 2000 till 2019. The relationship between the prime factors and CO2 emissions were identified using a simple linear regression model, confirming the significance of this relation. The strength of these relations was numerically measured using a clustered analysis. The results indicate that a negative impact on CO2 emission was found in relation to the increase in population and urbanization based on the survival requirements and sustainability in social and urban settings. The effect of the factor 'average years of schooling' on CO2 emission is relatively negligible when compared to the other chosen factors. The findings provide sufficient information to develop and support suggestions for enhancing the available policies in EU member states. © 2020 IEEE.","CO emission; multiple regression; sustainability; sustainable development goals; urbanization","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Agricultural land; Carbon emissions; European Union countries; Food production; Member countries; Population sizes; Simple linear regression; Statistical approach; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086079965

This threatens to cause a significant challenge that is exacerbated by a gap between the supply and demand of affordable energy. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of utilising nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB) to improve the performance of residential buildings in Iraq and the Middle East. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Iraq as a case-study because of the breadth of climatic conditions experienced across its wide-reaching territory and also because of the recent critical infrastructural challenges following the geo-political crisis. Three virtual buildings were simulated for Baghdad, Mosul and Basra cities to narrow the confines of the region to achieve nZEB under current and future climatic weather scenarios. Findings: The findings showed that in all three cases studies, the buildings located within the three climatic regions in Iraq could achieve both significant annual energy reductions as well as nZEB standards which could range from 41 per cent to 87 per cent for current climatic conditions and 40 per cent to 84 per cent by 2080. An analysis has also been carried out for the three case-study cities which revealed significant operational-cost savings achievable through nZEB buildings. Originality/value: There are currently limited studies that investigate such positive potential for nZEB strategies under the current and predicted future climatic scenarios in the Middle East. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Building performance simulation; Climate positive building; Hot arid climate; Middle East; Nearly zero-energy buildings; Residential buildings","Buildings; Economics; Climatic conditions; Climatic scenarios; Critical threshold; Design/methodology/approach; Political crisis; Positive potential; Residential building; Supply and demand; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083283424

Nonetheless, it has always imposed a sustainability challenge, both economically and environmentally. This paper proposes a solution for sustainable residential heating in regions experiencing moderate Winters. The solution integrates the effects of intelligent design and operation. It encompasses minimization of thermal inadequacy, renewable energy incorporation, and optimal policy for the heating controls. Through a case study for an apartment in Jordan, the merits of the proposed solution are highlighted in terms of performance, feasibility, and environmental-friendliness using a detailed physical model. It was found out that thermal inadequacy could double both electricity consumption and generated CO2. Additionally, despite having global warming potential for their working fluids, utilization of heat pumps instead of electric heaters can reduce CO2 emissions by 75 % with a payback period as short as 15 heating months. Finally, various heating schemes are examined. A proposed policy which represents a hybrid control technique merging threshold controller with demand-based zone heating was found to be capable of handling the trinary trade off resulting from thermal comfort, cost reduction, and minimum number of heating system starts. An optimal set of lower and upper bounds for active and inactive periods were found. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Intelligent system; Residential heating; Solar PV; Sustainability; Thermal adequacy","Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Economic and social effects; Global warming; Heating equipment; Housing; Intelligent systems; Investments; Sustainable development; Electricity-consumption; Environmental friendliness; Global warming potential; Lower and upper bounds; Residential heating; Residential sectors; Solar PVs; Thermal adequacy; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079013977

The nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression (NSUR) method was used to fit each of the three systems simultaneously; namely, aggregated model systems with no parameter restriction (AMS0), aggregated model systems with one parameter restriction (AMS1), and aggregated model systems with three parameter restrictions (AMS3). A unique weighting function for each biomass model was applied to address the heteroscedasticity issue. The systems assertively guarantee the additivity property, in which, the summation of the respective predicted tree components (i.e., root, stem, branch, and foliage) will match the prediction of subtotals (i.e., crown and aboveground) and total biomass. Using one-, two-, and three-predictor combinations (i.e., D (diameter at breast height), D and H (total height), and D, H, and CL (crown length) as the general model underlying formats, three systems of additive biomass model were developed. Our results indicate that (1) all of the aggregated model systems performed well and the differences between the systems were relatively small; (2) the rank order of the three systems based on an array of statistics are as follows: AMS0 > AMS1 > AMS3; (3) the carbon concentration significantly varied depending on the types of tree tissues and growing regions; (4) the regional respective component carbon concentration and regional weighted mean carbon concentration multiplied by observed biomass value appeared to be the best approach to calculate carbon stock. © 2020 by the authors.","Aggregated model system; Biomass additivity; Heteroscedasticity; Nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression (NSUR); Quantifying carbon stock","Additives; Biomass; Forestry; Aggregated modeling; Carbon concentrations; Diameter-at-breast heights; Heteroscedasticity; Natural forests; Seemingly unrelated regression; Three parameters; Weighting functions; Carbon; angiosperm; biomass; carbon; concentration (composition); prediction; quantitative analysis; regression analysis; Additives; Biomass; Carbon; China; Concentration; Forestry; Systems; Trees; China; Quercus mongolica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085295917

Among various molecular parameters, cohesive interactions between polymer chains are found to play a key role in influencing the thermomechanical response of glass-forming polymers. Here, we employ atomistically informed coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations to study the mechanical properties of the polymer material in a glassy state. Built upon the recently developed ""energy renormalization"" (ER) coarse-graining approach, we take polycarbonate (PC) as a model system to systematically explore the shear response and dynamical heterogeneity of polymers under the influence of cohesive interactions. Our results show that the polymer with a larger cohesive interaction exhibits a greater shear modulus and a higher degree of dynamical heterogeneity, which is uncovered by evaluating the local molecular stiffness. This pronounced dynamical heterogeneity with increasing cohesive interactions is found to be closely correlated to the packing frustration at a molecular level, which can be quantified by the glass ""fragility"", a measure of the relative strength of the temperature dependence of relaxation. Our findings highlight the critical role of cohesive interaction on the mechanical behavior of glassy polymers and provoke the idea of achieving a tailored design of polymer materials via molecular-level engineering. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Glass; Molecular dynamics; Temperature distribution; Coarse-grained molecular dynamics; Cohesive interactions; Dynamical heterogeneities; Glass forming polymers; Molecular parameters; Technological applications; Temperature dependence; Thermo-mechanical response; Polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082777545

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is applied to simulate the environmental impacts for each fuel mixture. To prevent mixture designs inherited collinearly from correlating LCA results, fuel mixtures are first sampled prior to conducting LCA and then later optimized using a regression-based methodology to reduce entailed environmental impacts. Method: Setting the functional unit to 1 m3 of desalinated water induces different reference flows of energy requirements depending on the fuels used. Increasing the level of any fuel type within the fuel mixture scenario will cause a decrease in the level of the other fuel type(s) included. An augmented simplex lattice mixture (ASLM) design is applied to indicate correct experimental conditions and to prevent the correlation due to collinearity inherited from the nature of mixture problems. Regression models are formulated to represent life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results in a closed form suitable for response surface methodology (RSM) optimization. An overall composite sustainability index (CSI) is a single index calculated by aggregating and normalizing corresponding LCIA responses of different units, ranges, and scales using the geometric mean-based method. Results and discussion: The results indicate that marine sediment ecotoxicity (MSE) is the category most adversely affected by multistage flash distillation (MSF). On a nationwide scale, the LCA optimized results scored a 17% reduction in associated environmental impacts, which corresponds to a 4.2% reduction in the county’s carbon footprint and a 62% reduction in MSE while incurring a minor retrofitting cost to desalination facilities. Conclusions: High MSE results due to excessive fossil fuel consumption/burning in MSF should gain as much attention as paid toward global warming potential. High MSE entails the risk of having heavy metals entering the food chain. On the other hand, the geometric mean approach is found to be an effective model to aggregate the LCIA results into a single index while avoiding the subjectivity of the value judgment used in LCIA weighting. This approach serves as a unit-free rescaling method that is robust to outliers or large values examined across different LCIA impacts. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Desalination; Design of experiment; Geometric mean; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Mixture designs; Multistage flash distillation (MSF); Optimization; Regression; Response surface methodology; Weighting","fossil fuel; heavy metal; sea water; analytical parameters; Article; augmented simplex lattice mixture design; carbon footprint; combustion; composite sustainability index; controlled study; desalination; distillation; ecotoxicity; energy resource; environmental impact; food chain; geographic and geological phenomena; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; marine sediment; mathematical parameters; multistage flash distillation; priority journal; process optimization; regression analysis; response surface method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079445494

The calibration and validation were performed by using data collected from field experiments carried out in the north-east of South Africa, on shallow Ferrosol and Luvisol soils. The scenarios dealt with: (i) the initial soil-water availability (fulfilling or not the soil-water reserve at planting); (ii) the irrigation dose frequency (high versus low irrigation doses ranging from 10 to 40 mm per application); (iii) the fertilization dose frequency (full versus split fertilization application). The results indicated that only the fertilization scheduling may significantly affect tomato yields, while irrigation scheduling has a minor role. However, compared to the local official irrigation guidelines, it is recommended to slightly increase the irrigation doses during the first 4 weeks of growth for tomato grown between early September and mid-December, and to slightly decrease the doses in the second part of the growing cycles starting in February and May.

In order to present a decent argument that is viable for policy implementation, the study adopts the combined methodologies of Johansen cointegration; the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) of Pesaran et al. J Am Stat Assoc 94(446):621–634 (1999); and the Toda and Yamamoto J Econ 66(1–2):225–250 (1995) Granger causality. Empirical outcomes show (i) the kg oil equivalent per capita energy consumed exercise positive and significant impacts on metric tons of per capita CO2 emissions, and it is the principal determinant of environmental degradation in both the short-run and the long-run (ii) renewable energy consumption and economic growth also exercise negative and significant impacts on metric tons of per capita CO2 emissions. Based on our empirical findings, we conclude that partisan conflict indirectly plays a significant role in environmental sustainability targets of the United States. Thus, we are of the opinion that the government should avoid heightened partisan conflict among the political parties in order to promote sustainable environmental policies that would enhance sound and clean environment for both the immediate and the future generation. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Energy demand; Environmental pollution; Partisan conflict; Real income; United States","carbon emission; economic growth; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental quality; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; United States; carbon dioxide; economic development; environmental policy; policy; renewable energy; United States; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Environmental Policy; Policy; Renewable Energy; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078068129

This study revealed that wheat can induce a 3.5–9.2-fold increase in N2O emissions under different soil fertility levels, and that this “plant” source of N2O occurs in the rhizosphere. Moreover, plants induced soil niche differentiation between denitrifiers harboring the nitrous oxide reductase genes nosZI and nosZII. Pulse labeling of wheat demonstrated that 67% of 13C-labeled nosZI-type denitrifiers, but no nosZII-type denitrifiers, were more abundant in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil. Furthermore, a higher percentage of bacterial genomes containing nitrite reductase genes was found within plant-associated nosZI-type denitrifiers than nosZII-type denitrifiers, favoring NO2 − to N2O conversion. Overall, this study revealed a strong selective stimulating effect of wheat on soil denitrifiers through root-derived carbon and a key role of the nosZI-type community in rhizosphere denitrification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Nitrous oxide (N2O); nosZ; Rhizodeposition; Stable isotope probing (SIP); Wheat","Denitrification; Genes; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrous oxide; nosZ; Rhizodeposition; Stable-isotope probing; Wheat; Soils; denitrification; gene expression; nitrous oxide; stable isotope; wheat; Bacteria (microorganisms); Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079330322

Drought will likely continue inputting immense pressure on food security in fragile ecosystems like Sub-saharan Africa (SSA). As an adaptation measure to severe drought events since the 1980s, the overall goal of irrigated schemes (foreign exchange earnings) thus has been shifted to sustain food security. This study assessed the impacts of such drought-driven agricultural policy and future climate change on the performance of large irrigated schemes in SSA, with special emphasis on the Gezira scheme, GS (0.88 mha), Sudan. The optimized scenario of the baseline period, developed in GAMS (the general algebraic modeling system), showed that the expansion of food crops on the expensive of cash crops resulted in a reduction of 83 % in gross net benefits and loss of 63 % in irrigation water in the GS since the severe drought of 1984. The biased corrected rainfall and temperature outputs of three randomly selected regional climate models (RCMs) under unmitigated pathways (RCP 8.5), suggested increased rainfall of 40 mm, increased temperature of 3.3 °C and 5 % increase in reference evapotranspiration for the period 2040–2070, compared to the baseline (1960–1990). The predicted conditions experienced neither extreme drought nor extreme wet events; however, severe and moderately drought events remain a challenge up to 2060. Due to climate change and current water management practices, the FAO-Aquacrop predicted reductions in crop yields and water productivity, especially for cotton and sorghum of 40 and 29 % respectively. Optimized future crop scenarios indicate that food crops such as sorghum and wheat are not viable. Cash (cotton) and soil fertility maintenance crops (groundnuts) would be better for sustaining economic viability. The agricultural policy and water management practices thus should be revisited to keep pace with future climate changes. © 2020","Aquacrop; Eastern Africa region; Optimization; Regional climate models","Cotton; Crops; Drought; Food supply; Global warming; Irrigation; Optimization; Rain; Water management; Water supply; Agricultural policies; Aquacrop; Eastern Africa; Increased temperature; Management practices; Reference evapotranspiration; Regional climate models; Scientific results; Climate models; agricultural policy; air temperature; cash cropping; climate change; cotton; drought; evapotranspiration; food policy; food security; global warming; irrigation system; management practice; optimization; performance assessment; rainfall; regional climate; soil fertility; sustainability; water management; Gezira; Sub-Saharan Africa; Sudan; Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078702476

Synthesis, characterization and electrochemical CO2 reduction activity of a air-stable cobalt(III) diphenylphosphenethano-bis(2-pyridinethiolate)chloride [{Co(dppe)(2-PyS)2}Cl, 1-Cl] complex is divulged. The complex reduces CO2 under homogeneous electrocatalytic conditions to produce CO with high Faradaic efficiency (FE &gt; 92%) and selectivity in the presence of water. Through detailed electrochemical investigations, product analysis, and mechanistic investigations supported by theoretical calculations, it is established that complex 1-Cl reduces CO2 in its Co(I) state. A reductive cleavage leads to a dangling protonated pyridine arm which enables facile CO2 binding through a H-bond donation and facilitates the C-O bond cleavage via a directed protonation. A systematic benchmarking of this catalyst indicates that it has a modest overpotential (∼180 mV) and a TOF of ∼20 s-1 for selective reduction of CO2 to CO with H2O as a proton source. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083219012

It considers the possibilities for advancing community resilience and capacity building through an exploration of different aspects of governance and policy. Given the diversity of these countries and recent disasters, a variety of perspectives are considered: institutional and policy frameworks, risk management governance, recovery operations, building codes, and policy and media discourse. The book offers a collective understanding of practice, which can offer global lessons to a world increasingly beset by disasters and with uncertain environmental futures.

These devices are manually fed, and their usage protocols are a function of a number of variables, including user habits, household characteristics, and environmental factors. In this study, researchers logged the stack wall temperatures of 4 OWHH and 20 IWS units in the states of New York and Washington over two heating seasons. Stack wall temperature is an indicator of changes in combustion modes. Two algorithms were developed to identify usage modes and cold and warm start refueling events from the stack wall temperature time series. A linear correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of heat demand on usage patterns. The results and methods presented here will inform the cataloging of typical operational patterns of OWHHs and IWSs as a step in the development of performance testing procedures that represent actual in-home usage patterns. Implications: Current US regulatory programs for residential wood heating use a certification program to assess emissions and efficiency performance. Testing under this program uses a test that burns 100% of a single, standardized wood fuel charge to assess performance at different steady-state load conditions. This study assessed in-field operational patterns to determine if the current certification approach accurately characterized typical homeowner use patterns. The data from this study can be used to inform revisions to testing methods to increase certification test comparability between lab and field performance. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Most of the emissions result from the use of fossil reducing agents. Nevertheless, the use of fossil fuels for other purposes must also be eliminated in order to reach the Swedish emissions reduction targets. In this study, we investigate the possibility to replace fossil gaseous and liquid fuels used for heating in the ISI, with liquefied biomethane (LBG) produced through gasification of forest residues. We hypothesize that such utilization of fuels in the Swedish ISI is insufficient to independently drive the development of large-scale LBG production, and that other sectors demanding LBG, e.g., for transportation, can be expected to influence the economic potential for the ISI to switch to LBG. The paper investigates how demand for LBG from other sectors can contribute to, or prevent, a phase-out of fossil fuels used for heating purposes in the ISI under different future energy market scenarios, with additional analysis of the impact of a CO2 emissions charge. A geographically explicit cost-minimizing biofuel production localization model is combined with heat integration and energy market scenario analysis. The results show that from a set of possible future energy market scenarios, none yielded more than a 9% replacement of fossil fuels used for heating purposes in the ISI, and only when there was also a demand for LBG from other sectors. The scenarios corresponding to a more ambitious GHG mitigation policy did not achieve higher adoption of LBG, due to corresponding higher biomass prices. A CO2 charge exceeding 200 EUR/tonCO2 would be required to achieve a full phase-out of fossil fuels used for heating purposes in the ISI. We conclude that with the current policy situation, substitution of fossil fuels by LBG will not be economically feasible for the Swedish ISI. © 2020","Biomass gasification; Biomethane; Energy market scenarios; Iron and steel industry; Process integration; Supply chain optimization","Carbon dioxide; Competition; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gasification; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Iron and steel industry; Power markets; Reducing agents; Steelmaking; Supply chains; Biomass Gasification; Biomethane; Energy market scenarios; Process integration; Supply chain optimization; Fossil fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080042583

The ANN model has been built and validated based on real measurements of CO at different ventilation conditions of the case study. Different fuzzy controllers, fixed and adaptive, are designed to control CO during loading and unloading states. Scaling factors of fuzzy controller are adapted using two different ways namely Supervisor Fuzzy Controller (SFC) and Particle Swamp Optimization (PSO).

This paper presents empirical findings on Ghanaian cocoa farmers' experiences of climate change, the coping strategies they have used and the factors that influenced their adaptation decisions. Primary data were collected through a structured survey of 313 households in 20 communities in Dormaa West and Bia East districts of Ghana. The econometric analysis of the data shows that more than 90% of cocoa farmers have been exposed to negative impacts of climate change. This resulted in severe and very severe effects on their cocoa production and livelihood. Yet a fourth of the respondents have not implemented any adaptation strategy. We argue that this is due to the economic superiority of cocoa as a perennial crop vis-à-vis other agricultural (annual) crops. We conclude that there is need for the development of adaptation technologies for current cocoa farmers but also need for more transformational adaptation policies that generate jobs and income generating activities outside cocoa cultivation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Cocoa farmers; Ghana; Perennial crops","Cocoa; Crops; Cultivation; Economic analysis; Adaptation; Adaptation decisions; Adaptation policies; Adaptation strategies; Econometric analysis; Ghana; Income generating activities; Perennial crops; Climate change; Adaptation; Cultivation; Data; Economic Analysis; Farm Crops; Ghana; Production; Systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079653184

Socioeconomic and environmental factors may modify the health effects of green space. We examined the association between residential green space and reimbursed CV medication sales in Belgium between 2006 and 2014, adjusting for socioeconomic deprivation and air pollution. We analyzed data for 11,575 census tracts using structural equation models for the entire country and for the administrative regions. Latent variables for green space, air pollution and socioeconomic deprivation were used as predictors of CV medication sales and were estimated from the number of patches of forest, census tract relative forest cover and relative forest cover within a 600 m buffer around the census tract; annual mean concentrations of PM2.5, BC and NO2; and percentages of inhabitants that were foreign-born from lower- and mid-income countries, unemployed or had no higher education. A direct association between socioeconomic deprivation and CV medication sales [parameter estimate (95% CI): 0.26 (0.25; 0.28)] and inverse associations between CV medication sales and green space [−0.71 (−0.80; −0.61)] and air pollution [−1.62 (−1.69; −0.61)] were observed. In the regional models, the association between green space and CV medication sales was stronger in the region with relatively low green space cover (Flemish Region, standardized estimate −0.16) than in the region with high green space cover (Walloon Region, −0.10). In the highly urbanized Brussels Capital Region the association tended towards the null. In all regions, the associations between CV medication sales and socioeconomic deprivation were direct and more prominent. Our results suggest that there may be an inverse association between green space and CV medication sales, but socioeconomic deprivation was always the strongest predictor of CV medication sales. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cardiovascular disease; Environment; Epidemiology; Exposure; Medication sales; Public health","Air pollution; Epidemiology; Forestry; Housing; Public health; Surveys; Brussels Capital Region; Cardio-vascular disease; Ecological studies; Environment; Environmental factors; Exposure; Parameter estimate; Structural equation models; Sales; black carbon; nitrogen dioxide; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; disease treatment; environmental factor; epidemiology; greenspace; health expenditure; public health; socioeconomic status; air pollution; Article; Belgium; cardiovascular medication sale; correlational study; economic aspect; educational status; environmental aspects and related phenomena; low income country; middle income country; particulate matter; population density; priority journal; residential green space; sensitivity analysis; social status; trend study; unemployment; urbanization; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; socioeconomics; Belgium; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Belgium; Environmental Exposure; Particulate Matter; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077735971

This phenomenon is known as Urban Heat Island (UHI). Due to this phenomenon, high temperatures and the use of air conditioning in the buildings has increased. Outdoor thermal performance is affected by street orientation and aspect ratio (H/W) while Cairo is a mega city, which has different fabrics with different streets (H/W) and orientations. Therefore, this study seeks to find a suitable vegetation ratio for the aspect ratio street (H/W) of 1:1 in order to enhance thermal performance, mitigate UHI and to reduce the energy in buildings in hot arid climates (case study - Cairo). One street was chosen of (H/W) 1:1 as a case study, from downtown Cairo. This street was simulated by using ENVI-met V4.3.2 and by applying four orientations: east-west, north-south, northwest – southeast 310° and northeast – southwest 40°. These orientations were simulated by using the reference case (without vegetation) and three suggested vegetation scenarios (20% trees, 50% trees and 70% grass). The meteorological outputs were discussed in order to know the best vegetation scenario, which enhances thermal performance. In addition, these outputs were used through the DesignBuilder model in order to know the best scenario, which reduces the consumption of energy in buildings. This study found that trees are ineffective in the decreasing of air temperature and the reduction of energy in buildings while they are effective in enhancing thermal performance in the all orientations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aspect ratio (H/W); Energy; Street orientation; Thermal performance; UHI; Vegetation","Air conditioning; Atmospheric temperature; Buildings; Forestry; Vegetation; Air temperature; Consumption of energy; Energy; Energy in buildings; High temperature; Hot arid climates; Thermal Performance; Urban heat island; Aspect ratio; air conditioning; air temperature; arid environment; building; energy efficiency; geometry; heat island; road; vegetation; Cairo [Cairo (GVR)]; Cairo [Egypt]; Egypt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079282520

This paper first evaluates social implications of current energy and water supply in a prototypical remote community against five future (2030) scenarios for synergistic provision of electricity, heat for cooking and water. This is followed by an integrated assessment of the social, environmental and economic life cycle sustainability through multicriteria decision analysis. The Business-as-usual (BAU) scenario shows high life cycle health impacts but low impacts from local air pollution. The contrary is true for the Independent and Advanced Independent scenarios which assume community self-sufficiency in energy and water supply. Greater access to electricity and water in the Advanced and Advanced Independent scenarios increases the potential for human development and security of supply, but there is an increase in the risk of accidents and decrease in social acceptability of the water supply. Similarly, a transition towards clean cooking fuels away from traditional solid biomass reduces local air pollution but increases reliance on imported fuels (BAU and Advanced scenarios). The Transition scenario is socially the most sustainable option, while Independent and Advanced Independent are the best options environmentally. They also have the lowest total operating costs, but have higher capital requirements than most other scenarios. Overall, unless extreme preferences for either environmental or social aspects are adopted, the Transition and Independent scenarios emerge as the most sustainable options. This suggests that current energy and water supply to remote communities can be transitioned sustainably to a self-sufficient system that does not depend on imported resources. The scenarios developed in this work present a framework for an integrated design and evaluation of energy and water supply in remote communities with the aim of aiding stakeholders in defining sustainable transition pathways. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Life cycle sustainability assessment; Multicriteria decision analysis; Off-grid communities; Rural development; Scenario analysis; Water-energy nexus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079535937

The toxic content of the pollution could relate to region-specific sources such as low standards for vehicles and fuels, cooking with solid fuels, and burning household waste. We implore the pursuit of interdisciplinary research to create new approaches with relevant stakeholders. Moreover, successful air pollution research must regard conflicts, tensions, and synergies inherent to development processes in African municipalities, regions, and countries. This includes global relationships regarding climate change, trade, urban planning, and transportation.

However, there is an urgent need to reduce the consumption of cement, where cement production leads to 5–8% of global emissions of carbon dioxide. Geopolymer concrete is an innovative building material produced by alkaline activation of pozzolanic materials such as fly ash, granulated blast furnace slag, and kaolin clay. Geopolymers are widely used in the production of geopolymer concrete due to their ability to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and reduce high energy consumption. During the present study, the environmental impact of two strength grades (30 MPa and 40 MPa) of metakaolin geopolymer concrete (GPC) was evaluated to study its applicability in the construction sector. The kaolin clay extracted from the Aswan quarries was activated by a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solution. To introduce geopolymer concrete in the Egyptian industry sector, its environmental performance, together with its technical performance, should be competitive to the cement concrete used mainly for the time being. The cost of this new concrete system should also be evaluated. The environmental impact of GPC was evaluated and compared with cement concrete using life cycle assessment analysis and IMPACT 2002+ methodology. The cost of production was calculated for 1 m3 of geopolymer concrete and conventional cement concrete. Metakaolin geopolymer concrete achieved a high compressive strength of ~ 56 MPa, splitting tensile strength of 24 MPa, and modulus of elasticity of 8.5 MPa. The corrosion inhibition of metakaolin geopolymer concrete was ~ 80% better than that of conventional cement concrete. Geopolymer concrete achieved a reduction in global warming potential by 61% and improved the human health category by 9.4%. However, due to the heavy burdens of sodium silicate, the geopolymer concrete negatively affected the quality of the ecosystem by 68% and showed a slightly higher impact than cement concrete on the resource damage category for low strength grade of 30 MPa. The high cost of the basic ingredients of the geopolymer resulted in a high production cost of geopolymer concrete (~ 92 US$) that was three times that of cement concrete (~ 31 US$). Based on the environmental results, geopolymer concrete based on locally available metakaolin clay can be applied in the construction sector as a green alternative material for cement concrete.
