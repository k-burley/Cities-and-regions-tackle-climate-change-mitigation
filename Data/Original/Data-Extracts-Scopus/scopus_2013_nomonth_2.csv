The City received over $10 million in grant and loan funding from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) State Revolving Fund (SRF) program to rehabilitate the existing AC pipe through the pre-chlorinated potable water main pipe bursting process. The City has currently replaced over 30 miles of AC pipe through the pipe bursting process. There has been a substantial amount of AC pipe installed throughout the United States and the City has realized many other utility providers, engineers and contractors have encountered similar issues when evaluating pipe bursting for AC pipe. The contractor on the project, Killebrew, Inc., has performed a Negative Exposure Assessment to prove that no asbestos fibers were being released during the pipe bursting process. EPA has now commissioned a study through the Water Research Foundation and the Battelle Institute to evaluate the environmental impact of AC pipe renewal technologies. Utility providers, engineers and contractors argue that pipe bursting does not make the existing AC pipe friable but continue to follow all existing National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutant (NESHAP) regulations for asbestos fibers on pipe bursting projects. The benefits of utilizing pipe bursting over traditional open cut construction in urban environments far outweigh the perceived hazards of bursting the AC pipe. © 2013 American Water Works Association AWWA DSS/EPS Conference Proceedings All Rights Reserved.",,"Asbestos fibers; Distribution systems; Exposure assessment; Florida department of environmental protections; National Emission standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants; Pipe bursting; Urban environments; Water research; Asbestos; Asbestos cement; Contractors; Environmental impact; Local area networks; Potable water; Asbestos; Cement; Drinking Water",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890541371

Section 1121 directs the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to establish a short sea transportation program and designate short sea transportation projects under the program to mitigate landside congestion. The Maritime Administration (MARAD) has implemented this short sea transportation program as the ""America's Marine Highway Program"" (the Program). The Program is intended to expand the use of our inland, Great Lakes Saint Lawrence Seaway System, intracoastal, and coastal waterways for the transportation of freight (loaded in containers and trailers) and passengers to mitigate landside congestion, reduce greenhouse gas emissions per ton-mile of freight moved, and accomplish other objectives.The first section of this report provides the justification for expanding the utilization of Marine Highway services. It describes the interests of the Federal government in encouraging greater use of Marine Highways and, through the example of Europe, shows that government policy can be successful in achieving this result. An important point of this section is that the full range of public benefits of Marine Highway services will not be realized based solely on market-driven transportation choices.The sections immediately following the introduction explain the potential contributions of America's Marine Highway to the following objectives: • Improving our nation's economic competitiveness while creating and sustaining jobs, including through the reduction of landside traffic congestion, the ability to add cost-effective new freight and passenger transportation capacity, the reduction of wear-andtear on roads and bridges, and by providing resiliency to the surface transportation system;• Providing an environmentally sustainable transportation system that requires less energy and reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per ton-mile of freight moved;1• Adding to the nation's strategic sealift resources and supporting the nation's shipbuilding industry; and• Improving public safety and security through the safe movement of passengers and freight, including hazardous materials, and by enabling more effective transportation responses to natural and manmade disasters.The report next summarizes the actions taken by the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), through MARAD, to implement the short sea shipping provisions of the Energy Act. It begins by describing MARAD's rulemaking actions to implement the Energy Act, including the issuance of the Interim and Final Rules on the America's Marine Highway Program. Responding to the requirements of the Energy Act, the Secretary has designated 18 Marine Highway Corridors and has selected 8 Marine Highway Projects to operate on these corridors. Other actions directed by the Energy Act and undertaken by MARAD include efforts to promote the Marine Highway and include it in regional transportation plans; establishment of agreements with other U.S. agencies to use Marine Highway services; consultation with shippers on methods to incentivize the use of Marine Highway services; establishment of an America's Marine Highway Advisory Board; initiation of Marine Highway-related research in consultation with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and qualification of Marine Highway services to participate in the Capital Construction Funds program. This section of the report also highlights other important recent legislation by Congress, consisting of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which established new grant authority and funding to support Marine Highway projects, including the recently-implemented Marine Highway Grants program. In September 2010, USDOT announced the award of grants to three Marine Highway Projects and funding for three research studies of potential Marine Highway services under this new grants program. The next major component of the report summarizes other actions by MARAD to foster development of Marine Highway services. It cites the EPA's environmental leadership through its SmartWay program and its National Clean Diesel Campaign Clean Ports USA initiative. It describes MARAD's own efforts to promote sound environmental practices through the Environmental Achievement Program and the Marine Highway Benefits Calculator. The section also notes work with Canada and Mexico to promote Marine Highway systems for North America and MARAD's outreach efforts to the transportation industry and the public through its America's Marine Highway Program website. This section is followed by a description of important Marine Highway enterprises that MARAD has supported and includes a summary of the types of relevant business models for Marine Highway services.The report proceeds to a discussion of impediments to the expansion of Marine Highway services, beginning with the needs such services have for specialized infrastructure and equipment. It notes the importance of reducing the costs of Marine Highway operations and administration through best practices and reducing the costs of transshipping cargoes through ports, making a case for government assistance to reduce the high acquisition costs for some types of specialized infrastructure and equipment. It also describes the importance of establishing reliable transportation services, suitable to just-in-time supply chains, as a means of overcoming shipper reluctance to try Marine Highway services. Finally, it cites the need to educate the public and transportation planners on the important role that Marine Highway services can have for improving public welfare.The next to last section of the report identifies a range of potential legislation and regulatory actions that industry stakeholders have suggested to MARAD. These are actions, which are under consideration by the Administration and thus are not necessarily endorsed by MARAD, USDOT, or the Administration, that stakeholders say could induce increased waterborne freight traffic on America's Marine Highways. They include waiver of the Harbor Maintenance Tax for some non-bulk freight; equal Customs notification requirements for waterborne container shipments from Canada via the Great Lakes Saint Lawrence Seaway System relative to land-based shipments of the same containers; implementation of shipper tax credits linked to the value of public benefits associated with the decision to select water transportation; implementation of investment tax credits and accelerated depreciation for vessel and port equipment purchases; continued Congressional appropriations for matching capital grants such as those provided through the Marine Highway Grants program and, more broadly, the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) and TIGER II Discretionary Grants programs (some of which benefited port-related projects); modification of MARAD's Title XI loan guarantee program to help introduce more environmentally sustainable vessels into the U.S. fleet; and establishment of a Marine Highway infrastructure-oriented program similar to the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program that could help to fund port and terminal intermodal infrastructure.The report concludes with a section on conclusions. It cites the essential role that the private sector must play in making America's Marine Highway successful, but notes that without strong leadership from the Federal government the nation's water assets will continue to be underutilized for freight transportation.Information in this report is current through December 2010. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Worldwide, about 80 percent of those emissions come from the combustion of oil, coal, natural gas, and other fossil fuels; the remaining 20 percent comes from deforestation.1 (Because plants take in CO2, removing them releases some or all of that carbon.) Currently, in any given year, the equivalent of about half of total CO2 emissions are absorbed by the world's oceans, soil, and vegetation, which (together with the atmosphere and fossil carbon deposits) make up the natural reservoirs through which carbon flows over time. The other half of those emissions remain in the atmosphere, contributing to the rising atmospheric concentration of CO2 and the gradual warming of the Earth's climate.2 Various analyses suggest that avoiding future climate-related damage by starting to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2 would have greater benefits than costs. Options for doing that include not only curbing activities that generate emissions but also sequestering CO2-for example, by encouraging its absorption from the atmosphere into vegetation and soil (biological sequestration) and by trapping CO2 at power plants and industrial facilities before it is emitted and injecting it into underground storage sites (a process known as carbon dioxide capture and storage, or CCS). This paper looks at the methods, potential scale, and possible costs of both types of carbon sequestration.3 It also examines the particular role that sequestration could play in the context of the full range of possible actions to mitigate greenhouse-gas emissions. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The company will retrofit existing equipment at the plant, which is currently being used to produce petroleum-based diesel, to produce renewable diesel. The heart of the revamp will be the Ecofining process developed jointly by Eni and UOP. The Ecofining process produces a drop-in replacement fuel that is chemically identical to petroleum-based diesel and can be used without changes to engines or infrastructure. Raw materials for the process include palm or soya oil and waste cooking oil. According to UOP, the resulting Green Diesel offers a lifecycle reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 80% compared with diesel derived from petroleum. It also has a high energy density and is effective at cold or warm temperatures. Unlike Eni's Venice plant, where the fuel is to become a primary product, conventional refineries can use Green Diesel as a blending stock to expand their petroleum-derived diesel pool. Eni aims to produce more than 100 million gal/yr of renewable diesel in Venice, with initial production starting in 2015. In addition to technology licensing, UOP will provide basic engineering, equipment and training for the project. The process delivers a fuel with improved performance over more conventional biodiesel and petroleum-based diesel, including a cetane value of 80 compared with a cetane range of 40-60 in retail diesel. The decision to convert the Venice site to the production of renewable biofuels is a response to the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive, which mandates that, by 2020, 20% of its 27 member states' energy must come from renewable sources, and greenhouse gases must be reduced by 20%.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891893235

Because its generation remains largely based on fossil fuels, electricity is also the largest and the fastest-growing source of energy-related CO2 emissions, the primary cause of human-induced climate change. Forecasts from the IEA and others show that ""decarbonising"" electricity and enhancing end-use efficiency can make major contributions to the fight against climate change. Global and regional trends on electricity supply and demand indicate the magnitude of the decarbonisation challenge ahead. As climate concerns become an essential component of energy policy-making, the generation and use of electricity will be subject to increasingly strong policy actions by governments to reduce their associated CO2 emissions. Despite these actions, and despite very rapid growth in renewable energy generation, significant technology and policy challenges remain if this unprecedented essential transition is to be achieved. This book provides an authoritative resource on progress to date in this area, with statistics related to CO2 and the electricity sector across ten regions of the world. It also presents topical analyses on meeting the challenge of rapidly curbing CO2 emissions from electricity, from both a policy and technology perspective. © 2013 OECD/IEA.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957751054

It has been shown that the variations of δ13C values in plant tissues and berries are related to the climatic conditions of plant growth: moisture (a sum of annual precipitation) and temperature (a sum of annual effective temperatures). The carbon isotope ratios of vegetative and generative parts of vine plants have been found to be noticeably affected by vine varieties. The different 13C contents in ethanol produced from wine of the Aligoté and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties grown in two Russian vineyard regions are due to vine growth conditions, variety attribution and wine production techniques. An analytically significant parameter determined as exemplified by the Aligoté and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties in fermentation of vine harvested in different seasons and in both vineyard regions was an increased 13C content in ethanol with respect to dry (non-volatile) residue in wine after distillation of ethanol. This characteristic has been determined by a systematic difference of about 1-2‰ between the δ13C value of ethanol and the dry residue. A relative constancy in the carbon isotope composition of ethanol and of the dry residue in the final product is the basis for determining the authenticity of grape wines by means of isotopic mass spectrometry irrespective of natural factors. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","berries; carbon isotope content; climate; ethanol; isotopic mass spectrometry; leaves; roots; soil; vine; vine plant variety","berries; Carbon isotopes; climate; leaves; roots; vine; Vine plant; Breweries; Carbon; Distillation; Ethanol; Fruits; Isotopes; Mass spectrometry; Soils; Wine; Plants (botany)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891777074

Three prominent compounds transporting large amounts of marine halogens into the atmosphere are bromoform (CHBr3), dibromomethane (CH2Br2) and methyl iodide (CH3I). The input of marine halogens to the stratosphere has been estimated from observations and modelling studies using low-resolution oceanic emission scenarios derived from top-down approaches. In order to improve emission inventory estimates, we calculate data-based high resolution global sea-to-air flux estimates of these compounds from surface observations within the HalOcAt (Halocarbons in the Ocean and Atmosphere) database (<a hrefCombining double low line""https://halocat. geomar.de/""targetCombining double low line"" blank"">https:// halocat.geomar.de/</a>). Global maps of marine and atmospheric surface concentrations are derived from the data which are divided into coastal, shelf and open ocean regions. Considering physical and biogeochemical characteristics of ocean and atmosphere, the open ocean water and atmosphere data are classified into 21 regions. The available data are interpolated onto a 1 &times;1 grid while missing grid values are interpolated with latitudinal and longitudinal dependent regression techniques reflecting the compounds' distributions. With the generated surface concentration climatologies for the ocean and atmosphere, global sea-to-air concentration gradients and sea-to-air fluxes are calculated. Based on these calculations we estimate a total global flux of 1.5/2.5 Gmol Br yr-1 for CHBr3, 0.78/0.98 Gmol Br yr-1 for CH2Br2 and 1.24/1.45 Gmol Br yr-1 for CH3I (robust fit/ordinary least squares regression techniques). Contrary to recent studies, negative fluxes occur in each sea-to-air flux climatology, mainly in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. ""Hot spots"" for global polybromomethane emissions are located in the equatorial region, whereas methyl iodide emissions are enhanced in the subtropical gyre regions. Inter-annual and seasonal variation is contained within our flux calculations for all three compounds. Compared to earlier studies, our global fluxes are at the lower end of estimates, especially for bromoform. An under-representation of coastal emissions and of extreme events in our estimate might explain the mismatch between our bottom-up emission estimate and top-down approaches. © Author(s) 2013.

Installations based on chemical absorption using amine solvents is justified in the case of power plants and CHP plants. The CO 2 processing unit (CPU) is characterized by a large amount of stream for solvent regeneration and the consumption of electricity mainly in compressors of CO2 product. Additional internal consumption of heat and electricity produces waste heat due to the condensation of H2O in the mixture of CO2 and H2O resulting from the desorption of CO2 and interstage cooling of the CO2 compressors. The waste heat recovery system can be connected with the preheating of network water in the district heating systems cooperating with CHP plants. In this way the integration of the CHP plants with the post-combustion CO2 processing unit is realized. This integration requires some supplements in algorithms describing the thermodynamic indices in comparison with traditional cogeneration systems. Firstly, the indices of the internal load of heat and electricity was changed. This influences the net Energy Utilization Factor, secondly the analyzed thermodynamic index, and thirdly the partial energy efficiencies of the production of heat and electricity in a CHP unit. In this last case the principle of avoided fuel expenditure and the exergy method in coupled processes have been applied. The new algorithms for calculations mentioned above thermodynamic indices and the results of their analysis have been presented for two variants of integrated CHP-CPU systems: with and without waste heat recovery. The parameter in these analyses was unit heat for regeneration of the solvent. For comparison, the results of the analysis of reference CHP plant have been presented, too. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The method relies on an iterative procedure to calculate improved estimates of the forcing function starting from an initial estimate. Running a sequence of climate models can be computationally demanding and therefore computational efficiency is an important ingredient in formulating a tractable inverse modelling scheme. It is therefore crucial to initialise the iterative procedure with a forcing function that is a good estimate of the correct forcing function to reduce the number of iterations required. This is achieved by formulating a statistical closure scheme. A statistical closure scheme enables one to overcome the closure problem in which statistical moments of higher order appear in the prognostic equations for the statistical moments of a given order. For example, the equation for the mean field depends on second-order moments and the second-order moment equations in turn depend on third-order moments. The closure scheme that we employ involves a linearisation of the second-order moment terms, which physically represent the feedback of transient eddies on the mean circulation, in terms of the mean fields. The parameters required in this closure scheme are calculated by employing perturbation experiments. We demonstrate that the closure scheme leads to simulated climate states that are in close agreement to idealised and observed climate states with pattern correlations generally greater than 0.8. These closure based estimates may then be further improved by employing the iterative method. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Attribution; Climate change; Closure; Eddy parameterisation; Inverse modelling","Boundary layers; Climate models; Computational efficiency; Inverse problems; Iterative methods; Method of moments; Operations research; Attribution; Closure; Eddy parameterisation; Inverse modelling; Number of iterations; Pattern correlation; Prognostic equations; Statistical moments; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062547255

Carbon supply curve was developed and sensitivity analysis was conducted with various interest rate and carbon price. It was found that the optimal rotation of Chinese fir in the joint management does not change from traditional timber management due to the fact that timber price is much higher than carbon price, suggesting that opti decision for Chinese fir management will not change significantly and carbon sequestration supply from current Chinese forestland would not increase significantly within a large range change of carbon price. However, including carbon va would significantly increase the land value for forest management against alternative land uses, and will expand the forest area, which also increase the carbon storage in the expanded forestland.","Carbon sequestration supply; Chinese fir; Forest carbo; Forestland expected value","carbon sequestration; climate change; data acquisition; decision making; evergreen forest; forest management; forestry modeling; interest rate; land use change; timber harvesting; China; Jiangxi; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877282275

To reduce petroleum consumption, vehicle air pollution, and noise emissions, the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) was introduced to the U.S. market in 1999 and offered new efficiency-improving technologies. However, the current market share and adoption rate of HEVs are still low. HEV sales are not spatially and temporally uniform. The HEV spatial diffusion process is investigated, and the influence of the neighborhood effect (NE) on HEV adoption is analyzed. A cluster analysis is conducted with Florida add-on data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey to display the spatial clusters of the households that purchased HEVs from 2005 to 2008. More HEV clusters emerge over time. Geographic patterns demonstrate increasing numbers of clusters featuring households with hybrid vehicles and surrounding HEV adopters. Furthermore, the relationships between hybrid vehicle adoption, NEs, and sociodemographic factors are analyzed with weighted and unweighted binary logit models. NEs are confirmed to be significant in both urban and rural models, especially the factors of 1- and 5-mi neighborhood coverage. This finding indicates that potential buyers are more likely to purchase HEVs when HEV exposure is high in the surrounding areas, and this measurement of exposure is proved reasonable for NEs. Of the sociodemographic attributes, household income is the most significant variable and plays a dominant role in affecting the propensity to buy hybrid vehicles. Factors such as vehicle ownership, household structure, and education attainment level also significantly affect a household's choice to buy a hybrid car.",,"Geographic pattern; Household structures; Hybrid-electric vehicles; National household travel surveys; Petroleum consumption; Significant variables; Socio-demographic factors; Spatial diffusions; Cluster analysis; Commerce; Competition; Greenhouse gases; Sales; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893391388

Recent interest in syngas requires a better understanding of the role of hydrogen addition on the combustion process. In the present study, the extinction process of hydrogen enriched premixed flames near Lean Blow Out (LBO) in a swirl-stabilized combustor has been examined in both unconfined and confined configurations. High speed images of the flame chemiluminescence are recorded and a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) procedure is used to extract the dominant flame dynamics during the LBO process. By examining the POD modes, the spectral information and the statistical properties of POD coefficients, the effect of hydrogen addition on the LBO processes are analyzed and described in the paper. Results show that in unconfined flames, the shear layer mode along with flame rotation with local quenching and re-ignition is dominant in the methane-only case. For the open hydrogen enriched flames, the extinction times are longer and are linked to the lower minimum ignition energy for hydrogen that facilitates reignition events. In confined methane flames, a conical flame is observed and the POD mode representing the burning in the central recirculation zone appears to be dominant. For the 60% hydrogen enriched flame, a columnar burning pattern is observed and the fluctuation energies are evenly spread across several POD modes making this structure more prone to external disturbances and shorter extinction times.

It refers to finance flow that catalyzes low-carbon and climate-resilient development. Developed countries have promised to establish the Green Climate Fund, which will transfer $ 100 billion by 2020 to developing countries for climate adaptation and mitigation, in accordance with agreements during the Cancun Climate Change Conference. However, many uncertainties remain regarding climate financing, such as sources, amount and instruments. The influence of climate financing on global climate change and the economy is another uncertainty, which should be evaluated with an integrated assessment model. Since it remains unclear who will take responsibility for financing, we assume the following mechanism. Developed countries establish a special fund for climate financing, and financial flows to receiving countries are used entirely for mitigation. Therefore, reduction of excess emissions by climate financing in developing countries can be estimated by marginal emission reduction. The financing module is incorporated into the multi-regional climate policy assessment model MRICES (Multi-Regional dynamic Integrated model of Climate and Economy with GDP Spillovers). This model divides the world into six regions: the United States (US), Japan, European Union (EU), China, former Soviet Union (FSU), and the rest of the world (ROW). The US, EU and Japan are financing sources, whereas China and the ROW are finance receivers. In addition to the BAU (business-as-usual) scenario, a scenario with the Green Climate Fund operational by 2020 and a scenario with continuously increasing financing after 2020 are set, to evaluate the influence of climate financing on climate protection and global economic development. When only the climate funds presented in the Cancun agreements are implemented by 2020, it is found that these can only reduce CO2 emissions by 5. 02 GtC and 7. 96 GtC in China and ROW, respectively, lowering global temperature 0.01°C by 2100. The contribution to climate change mitigation is negligible, so a long-term climate financing program is necessary to substantially control global temperature rise. Therefore, it is assumed that there will be further climate financing, increasing 0. 5% annually after 2020. Results show 62. 74 GtC and 100. 42 GtC of reduced emissions in China and ROW, respectively, lowering global temperature 0. 18°C by 2100. This proves that continuous financial support is beneficial for controlling rising global temperatures. From the viewpoint of economic efficiency, developing countries always benefit from financial transfers. Developed countries suffer GDP loss at the beginning of such transfers, but these turn into GDP gains over time. The economic benefit is seven times greater than the GDP loss. Furthermore, global welfare can also be improved by climate finance transfers. Since China's economy has been developing rapidly, it is controversial whether climate financing should be transferred to that country. Compared with the scenario in which China receives no financing, model results show that not only will global temperatures be lowered by 2100, but global utility will also be enhanced by 2100 when part of the financing is transferred to China. This indicates the important role of China in international climate financing, because of the country's potential for greater marginal emission reduction than in the rest of the world.

Thin sections of varved early Holocene sediments were analyzed using light optical and scanning electron microscopic methods. Sediment micro-facies and geochemical analyses reveal two different seasonal clastic layer types: spring snow melt and dust layers. Dust layers distinctly differ from snow melt layers through their finer grain size, better sorting, higher Al and lower Mg and Ca contents. In contrast to recent Lake SHL sediments, during the early Holocene silt-sized dust has been deposited after spring snow melt and after pronounced spring diatom blooms. For the time interval between 11,580 and 7060 varve years BP dust layers were quantified at annual resolution. Highest intensities and frequencies of dust accumulation are observed in the period from 11,100 to 8200 varve years BP, in good agreement with dry conditions in this time interval documented by palaeoclimatic records derived from lake sediments and loess in central Asia and northern China. Based on modern meteorological observation of dust storms in China, the dust accumulation record mirrors mainly the variation in climatic conditions governing generation of cyclone and cold air surges in the arid and semi-arid mid-latitude regions of China and Mongolia. On multidecadal and centennial time scales, solar activity might have been an additional forcing factor for dust accumulation frequency in the early Holocene. Spectral analyses reveal 205-years and 88-years periodicities in variations of dust accumulation frequency that likely reflect the de Vries (Suess) and the Gleissberg solar cycles. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"arid region; climate variation; dust storm; environmental change; eolian deposit; Holocene; lacustrine deposit; loess; microfacies; paleoclimate; sediment chemistry; semiarid region; China; Jilin; Lake Sihailongwan; Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875552673

Using coenzyme B as the two-electron donor, MCR reduces methyl-coenzyme M (CH3-SCoM) to methane and the mixed disulfide, CoBS-SCoM. MCR contains an essential redox-active nickel tetrahydrocorphinoid cofactor, Coenzyme F430, at its active site. The active form of the enzyme (MCRred1) contains Ni(I)-F430. Rapid and efficient conversion of MCR to MCRred1 is important for elucidating the enzymatic mechanism, yet this reduction is difficult because the Ni(I) state is subject to oxidative inactivation. Furthermore, no in vitro methods have yet been described to convert Ni(II) forms into MCRred1. Since 1991, it has been known that MCRred1 from Methanothermobacter marburgensis can be generated in vivo when cells are purged with 100% H2. Here we show that purging cells or cell extracts with CO can also activate MCR. The rate of in vivo activation by CO is about 15 times faster than by H3 (130 and 8 min-1, respectively) and CO leads to twofold higher MCRred1 than H2. Unlike H2-dependent activation, which exhibits a 10-h lag time, there is no lag for CO-dependent activation. Based on cyanide inhibition experiments, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase is required for the CO-dependent activation. Formate, which also is a strong reductant, cannot activate MCR in M. marburgensis in vivo. © 2013 Zhou, Dorchak and Ragsdale.","Carbon monoxide; Electron transfer; Enzyme activation; Enzyme catalysis; Epr; Metalloenzymes; Methanogenesis; Nickel","carbon monoxide; formate dehydrogenase; formic acid; hydrogen; methyl coenzymeMreductase; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; article; cell growth; electron spin resonance; enzyme activation; Methanothermobacter marburgensis; nonhuman; protein purification; temperature; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; ultraviolet spectroscopy; Methanothermobacter marburgensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884245808

Under this scheme, the manufacturing firm in ten industries, such as steel and iron, petrochemical, chemical, nonferrous metal, electric power, building material, textile, paper, rubber and chemical fiber, with CO2 emissions not less than twenty thousand tons in 2010 or 2011 will become a part of carbon emission trading market. Estimating the marginal abatement costs for CO2 emissions in these industries would provide useful information for supporting decision making in the market. In this paper, we use the input distance function to derive the shadow prices and approximate the marginal abatement costs of CO2 emissions in Shanghai manufacturing sectors. Our shadow price estimates due to the input and output data of 2011 range from 0 to -94.90RMB/t-CO2, and the weighted average is -0.55RMB/t-CO2. Since minimizing CO2 abatement cost is one core target of the emission trading scheme in Shanghai, the potential abatement cost saving from pilot CO2 emission trading is also discussed. Finally, we provide a comparison between the result obtained from this paper and those in earlier studies that focused on Chinese manufacturing sectors.","Carbon emission trading scheme; Input distance function; Manufacturing; Shadow price","Civil aviation; Commerce; Costs; Environmental impact; Manufacture; Rubber applications; Steel fibers; Textile industry; Carbon emission trading; Emission trading scheme; Input distance functions; Manufacturing firms; Manufacturing sector; Marginal abatement costs; Shadow price; Weighted averages; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903643340

The tourism industry plays a role in the global anthropogenic impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Climate change and its associated implications are beginning to emerge as a major topic of discussion and research within tourism studies. The tourism sector uses an extensive range of transport energy. This includes moving visitors to, from and within tourist destinations, along with travel to accommodation facilities and tourism activities. Tourist destinations cover land areas that include forests, lakes and farms. These features can absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and sediment accumulation. The calculation and analysis of carbon sources and storage sinks, within tourist destinations, is important for emission reduction policy and to encourage the tourism sector to save energy. Further, it is also the basis of a new research field examining the relationship between tourism and the environment. Using the Lushan Scenic Area in Jiangxi province, China, as a case study, we calculate and analyze the carbon emissions and associated absorption in this region in 2010. The results show total carbon emissions in the Lushan Scenic Area were 108,697t in 2010. Local residents contributed to 19.52% of emissions while tourists accounted for 80.48%. Of the total carbon discharged by locals, food consumption accounted for 82.89%, energy use 11.79%, and traffic emissions 5.31%. Of the total carbon discharged by tourists, traffic emissions accounted for 50.24%, lodging 38.04%, food consumption 10.65%, and tourist activities 1.07%. Mitigation of carbon emissions can be achieved using the principles of elimination, reduction, substitution and offsetting. Practical measures employing these principles include reducing energy use, becoming more energy efficient, using sustainable energy sources and the compensation of unavoidable emissions through offsetting schemes. The control of transport induced carbon emissions is crucial, particularly in the tourism sector. The avoidance or reduction of long distance air travel is vital for reducing carbon emissions. In 2010, the Lushan Scenic Area absorbed 9,447t of carbon emissions. This included biomass primary productivity, soil absorption and aquatic absorption. The Lushan forest ecosystem, including biomass primary productivity and soil absorption, accounted for 98.38% of this carbon absorption practice. The small aquatic area located at Mount Lushan means aquatic absorption is virtually negligible. The carbon absorption of the land ecosystem within Mount Lushan accounts for 23.47% of the carbon emissions produced in this tourist area. However, tourist travel and the tourism industry, generally, have strong spillover effects on the environment. Thus, the carbon absorption level of the land ecosystem of Mount Lushan only accounted for 8.69% of the total carbon emissions attributed to this tourist destination. Therefore, Mount Lushan tourism is a significant source of carbon production. Our results have important implications for tourism management personnel and their understanding of carbon emissions and absorption. To support and develop forest carbon sinks, afforestation should be encouraged while original forest ecosystems are protected. The tourism industry needs to encourage responsible, sustainable, tourism. This will enable the tourism sector to continue to deliver excellent tourist experiences while achieving a lower carbon footprint.","Carbon absorption; Carbon emissions; Mount Lushan; Scenic tourist area","absorption; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; emission control; environmental issue; food consumption; geoaccumulation; photosynthesis; tourism management; China; Jiangxi; Lushan; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880488672

However, the urban forest structure, function and role in carbon(C) offsets of Chinese urban forests are little understood. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the C storage and sequestration by urban forests and C emissions from energy consumption by urban energy consumption in Guangzhou, and analyse the effect of urban forests offsetting the C emissions from energy use. This paper also discussed the relationship between urban low carbon development and forest C sink, and explored the management practices for improving Guangzhou's urban forest function of offsetting C emissions. Guangzhou is located in north side of the Pearl River, along southeastern coast of China. The forests in Guangzhou includes five main types: Eucalyptus, Plus massoniana, Cunninghamia lanceolata, economic forest and evergreen broad-leaved forest. C storage and sequestration were quantified using urban forest inventory data and by applying volume-derived biomass equations and other models related to net primary productivity (NPP). C emissions from urban energy use were estimated by accounting for fossil fuel use and C emission factors. Total C storage by Guangzhou's urban forests was estimated at 654.42×104 t, and average C density was 28.81 t/ hm2. C storage in different districts ranged from 1.50×104 t to 354.99×104 t, as in the following order: Conghua&gt;Zengcheng&gt;Huadu&gt;Baiyun&gt;Luogang&gt;Panyu&gt;Tianhe&gt; Huangpu. C storage of evergreen broad-leaved forest and young age class forest were respectively 530.67×104 t and 271.86× 104 t, which had played a chief role in forest total C storage in terms of forest type and age class. C sequestration by urban forests was 658,732 t/ a, with an average C sequestration rate was 2. 90 t·hm-2·a-1. The spatial distribution of C sequestration in Guangzhou was imbalanced: most of C was sequestrated in exurb just like Conghua and Zengcheng. The C sequestration percentages of Eucalyptus, Plus massoniana, Cunninghamia lanceolata, economic forest and evergreen broad- leaved forest were 6.25%, 8.13%, 3.67%, 1.48% and 82.25% respectively. C sequestration rate decreased with increasing forest age. For Eucalyptus, C sequestration for young, middle-aged, premature, mature and post-mature forests decreased with age from 3.06 t·hm-2·a-1 to 2.35 t·hm-2·a-1. Results were similar for Plus massoniana which decreased from 1.99 t·hm-2·a-1 to 1.34 t·hm-2·a-1, for Cunninghamia lanceolata from 4.06 t·hm-2·a-1 to 2.61 t·hm-2·a-1, and for evergreen broad-leaved forest from 4.17 t·hm-2·a-1 to 3.68 t·hm-2·a-1. Average annual C emissions of urban energy use from 2005 to 2010 in Guangzhou were 2907.41×104 t. Therefore, the C stored by urban forests equaled 22.51% of the average annual C emission from fossil fuel use, and C sequestration could offset 2.27% of the average annual C emission in Guangzhou. Urban forest's C sequestration had a small contribution on urban carbon reduction, but it is still one of the important measures of low carbon development from its comprehensive benefits such as releasing Oxygen, air purification, VOC(volatile organic compounds)management, stormwater runoff capture, building energy saving, aesthetics and recreation. Furthermore, this paper also analyzed the impacts of forest composition and forest age structure on C storage and sequestration of urban forests in Guangzhou, and gave suggestions on improving forest C sink to enhance C offset effect through the forest management.","Carbon offset; Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage; Energy carbon emission; Urban forest","age structure; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; data set; emission control; evergreen forest; forest inventory; fossil fuel; net primary production; spatial distribution; urban forestry; volatile organic compound; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884796771

The study site was located on dried flood plain dominated by sandy soils in Daxing District, southern Beijing, China. The objectives of our study were to a) qualify the dynamics of carbon, water fluxes and water-use efficiency (WUE) at an ecosystem level under various soil water conditions and b) examine the effects of environmental factors influencing WUE under different soil moisture conditions. We found that there was a significant relationship between gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and evapotranspiratoin (ET) under different soil water. When relative extractable soil water (REW) was less than 0. 1, both GEP and ET maintained at a low level and did not changed with the variation of environmental factors. GEP and ET increased as soil water contents (VWC) increase, but the greater effect of VWC on ET over GEP resulted in negative correlation between WUE and VWC when 0. 1&lt;REW&lt;0. 4. When REW was higher than 0. 4, climate factors showed a significant influence on the variation of GEP and ET through stomata. Air temperature (Ta) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were the main factors for the variation of GEP while air temperature (Ta) and saturated vapor pressure deficit (VPD) showed a significant effect on changes of ET. WUE decreased with the increasing VPD due to the higher sensitivity of ET to VPD than GEP. VWC was between 5. 2% and 8. 8% (0. 1&lt;REW&lt;0. 4) in this fast-growing poplar plantation, vegetation could utilize soil water efficiently and reached high rates of water use efficiency and carbon sequestration. We concluded that soil water condition was a key factor influencing WUE of the poplar plantation. Assessment of forest carbon sequestration and water consumption under a climate change environment must consider future precipitation regime in the study region.","Eddy covariance; Evapotranspiration; Gross ecosystem productivity; Poplar plantation; Relative extractable soil water; Water use efficiency","air temperature; carbon flux; deciduous tree; eddy covariance; energy flux; evapotranspiration; floodplain; microclimate; net ecosystem production; plantation; soil water; vapor pressure; water use efficiency; Beijing [China]; China; Daxing; Populus; Populus x canadensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875487776

The logs showed the reservoirs are associated with paleotopographic features in a very complex and heterogeneous fracture-vug-cave karst system that provides their fluid-flow pathways and storage capacity. The fluid-flow pathways were provided mainly from high-angle permeable fractures and vugs with good connectivity that were caused by a long period of weathering and leaching.

The 3-year project ""Guangdong, China's First CCS Ready Province"" (GDCCSR) is aimed to provide a comprehensive review to decision makers on the necessity, feasibility, and roadmap for the CCS development in Guangdong (GD), which is the most economically developed province in China. This paper reported the outcome of the project after the first two years. Although GD is featured by light industry and high dependence on energy import, the CO2 emission from GD is large. Modeling shows the implementation of CCS has a high dependence on carbon price and will be functioning in GD when the carbon price exceeds 130 RMB. The CO2 storage potential is limited inland GD, but in sedimentary basins of northern South China Sea the storage capacity is large enough to store more than 200 years of emissions from LPSs in GD. The high cost of offshore CO2 geological may be offset by utilizing existing infrastructure of depleted oil/gas fields. This possibility is found in northern Pearl River Mouth Basin, which may be matched with a potential low-cost CO 2 source from a planned refinery on the coast, and these would make a good oppotunity for a demo project. Benefits of adopting CO2 capture readiness (CCR) have been demonstrated by modelling a planned ultra supercritical pulverised coal power plant in GD. These benefits will be enlared if planned a regional CCR hub. The project has paid particular attention on building capacity and raising public awareness on CCS. The China Low-carbon Energy Action Network (CLEAN) was established in 2010 and is the first CCS network in China. The CCS roadmap for GD is in the process of drafting, which will be a road map for CCS development in GD up to the year of 2030. In general, though 2-year's work the GDCCSR project has made a significant progress toward making the Guangdong province being CCS ready. © 2013 The Author.","CCS rediness; GDCCSR; Guangdong; Southern China",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898769092

Many studies have been conducted either on the CO2 capture side or on the sequestration side, but research on CO2 transport, which connects the capture side and the sequestration side, is rather limited. CO2 capture sites and sequestration sites are usually not geographically located in the same region, thus planning and design of CO2 transport infrastructure must be considered before capture and sequestration activities are conducted. Previously, some studies have been conducted to address the optimal planning problem of CO2 pipelines network via a source-sink match approach, which is applicable to early stages of CCS development when the total amount of CO needed to be transported is rather small. However, in scenarios with large amount of CO to be transported, the source-sink match approach appears to be less efficient. In this manuscript, we propose a superstructure based modelling and optimization framework for optimal planning of CO2 transport pipelines network, where all CO2 emissions sources and sequestrations sites can be connected by pipelines, and pump stations can also be built along pipelines to maintain the pressure of CO transported. We also provide a case study of a region in North China, with 45 emissions sources and four sequestration sites. Different configurations of pipelines network are illustrated in scenarios with low, medium, and high CO2 capture rates. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","CCS; Mixed-integer programming; Optimal design; Pipelines network; Superstructure",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879024900

In this paper, different EGR systems are detailed and evaluated theoretically based on the thermodynamics of a turbocharged system featuring an EGR sub-system. Turbine expansion ratio is utilized as a metric to estimate engine efficiency, i.e., pumping losses during the gas exchange process. Approaches such as compressor and turbine bypassing are evaluated as well. Based on above analysis, a new approach is put forward to expand the turbocharger work zone, particularly in the high efficiency regions by correctly utilizing EGR systems at all engine speed range: low-pressure loop EGR system at lower engine speed range and high-pressure loop EGR system at high engine speed range. Both numerical simulation and dynamometer data provide evidence that the proposed approach not only improves engine power output (more than 7% increment in this study) throughout the engine speed range, but also improves fuel economy by reducing pumping losses (PMEP is reduced more than 35kPa).

Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill biocovers, where methanotrophs exist widely, played an important role in reducing emissions of methane and bioremediation of chlorinated hydrocarbon. Methylocystis strain JTA1, a new kind of facultative methanotroph isolated from age-fused, showed high tolerance for trichloroethene (TCE) and chloroform (CF). Then, effect of chlorinated hydrocarbon on methane oxidation and the degradation kinetic of chlorinated hydrocarbon were carried out. Strain JTA1 showed high-activity of methane oxidation at the chloroform concentration of 20-50 mg·L-1, which was much higher than the highest rate of reported bio-covers. In addition, the kinetic equation of TCE degradation by methanotrophs community was also fitted, the maximum degradation rate (qs, max = 1.51*10-4 min-1) and half-saturation constants (KS=2.58 mg·L-1, R2=0.961) were calculated according to kinetic equation of trichloroethylene degradation which fitted to Monad model well.

Accurately quantifying carbon sequestration by these forests can provide insight for strategic planning to mitigate greenhouse gas effects on climate change. This study provides a new methodology to estimate net forest carbon sequestration (FCS) in urban and community lands of northern New England using ground based forest growth rates, housing density data, satellite derived land cover and tree canopy cover maps at the county level. We estimated that the region's urban and community forests sequestered 603,200. tC/yr ($38.7. million/yr value), contributing 8.2% of regional net forest ecosystem carbon sequestration. The contributions at the state level varied from 2.3% in Vermont to 16.6% in New Hampshire with substantial variation at the county level up to 73.3%. Spatially, contribution rates from urban and community forests at the county level were much higher and concentrated in southeast portion of NH and southwest portion of ME along the coast, and decreased toward inland areas. Our estimated net FCS compared reasonably with gross FCS in the region reported by a previous study. On average, the net FCS was 34.2% lower (varying from 41.9% lower in Vermont to 28.1% lower in Maine) than the corresponding gross FCS mainly because of a lower regional average net growth rate used in this study, compared to the national average gross carbon sequestration rate used in the previous study. © 2012 .","Forest carbon sequestration; Housing density; Net forest growth rate; Percentage canopy cover; Social and ecological studies","canopy architecture; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; climate change; community forestry; greenhouse gas; growth rate; map; net ecosystem exchange; satellite imagery; strategic approach; urban forestry; New England; New Hampshire; United States; Vermont",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873137465

This result is due to grassland coverage declining, yield of grass decrease and poison rank grass overgrowing, caused by human activities interference or adverse natural factors. Since the grim situation, the quality of grassland decline, Grassland productivity, economic potential and service function deteriorate, biodiversity complexity level descend, recovery function weaken or disappear, which threat region ecological security. Therefore, grassland degradation and its ecological impact have been an important research area of ecology. Located at the east of Tibet Plateau, the three rivers headwater region is the source region of Yangtze River, Yellow River and lancang River, and regard as the water tower of China. Under the influences of climate change and human activities,the grassland degradation presented a general situation in the Three Rivers Headwaters Region of Qinghai Province in last decades. Mainly located in the source region of Yellow River,the alpine meadow degradation and alpine steppe desertification were common phenomena. Grassland degradation was the result under joint action of long-term climate change and unreasonable grazing. By using long-term historical data,this paper investigated the cause of grassland degradation in the aspects of climate change effect and grazing influence to grassland productivity in Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture since 1960s. The result showed that this region was sensitive to global warming. From 1961 to 2010, the annual average temperature ascending,annual precipitation slightly decreasing and moisture condition descending were the general trend. Nevertheless, the net primary productivity (NPP) was in the upward trend by the simulation of Miami Model,Thornthwaite Memorial Model and Synthetic Natural Vegetation Net Primary Productivity Model (Synthetic Model). The climate change improved the grassland productivity in generally. Hence,from macro point of view,climate change was not the cause of grassland degradation in the research area. The livestock amount at the end of year increased sharply in 1960s and reached the peak in 1970s. Large grassland current carrying capacity meant grassland overload and overgrazing. After that, the grassland deteriorated. The livestock amount at the end of year had extremely significant correlation (P<0.01) with NDVI condition. Therefore,long-term grassland overload and overgrazing was the cause of grassland degradation. The key points of degraded grassland recover and governance were controlling grassland current carrying capacity and relieving grassland livestock carrying pressure. Since 2000,with the declining of grassland current carrying capacity,degraded grassland began to recover.","Climate change; Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture; Grassland degradation; Overgrazing","biodiversity; climate change; ecological impact; ecosystem function; environmental degradation; grassland; headwater; human activity; livestock farming; moisture content; nature-society relations; NDVI; net primary production; overgrazing; China; Golog; Qinghai; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887269756

This study focuses on comparing the GHG emissions from a vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW) and a horizontal flow constructed wetland (HFCW) in the city of Tianjin, China. Two methods are used in this paper to estimate the indirect and direct GHG emissions. It is found that the VFCW emits 0.09, 1.34, and 3.31 kg equivalent CO2 (CO2 Eq.) to remove 1.00m3 wastewater, 1.00 kg COD, and 1.00 kg BOD in the studied life cycle, respectively, in contrast to 0.18, 2.10, and 5.42 kg CO2 Eq. for the HFCW. The results indicate that the adoption of VFCW is a more effective option with respect to GHG emissions when treating the same amount of pollutants. In addition, the operation phase which includes GHG emissions from water treatment process and energy consumption for pump dominates the GHG emissions. For different kinds of GHG from CWs, CO2 dominates the influence on climate change. The CH4 and N2O emissions should also deserve more attention due to their greater global warming potential. This paper further suggests that GHG emissions can be mitigated in the design, construction, and operation stages through some feasible measures. It would reduce GHG emissions in CWs by adopting hybrid CW system (e.g. HF-VF or VF-HF) or choosing suitable plant species which can mitigate GHG emissions. In addition, aeration could contribute to the control of GHG emissions from CWs. © 2013 Balaban Desalination Publications.","Constructed wetlands; GHG emission; Horizontal flow; Vertical flow; Wastewater treatment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875802085

The result shows that: the carbon footprint caused by household consumption in urban area is much more than that in rural areas. Carbon footprint by rural residents was mainly caused by direct household energy consumption. The per capita direct carbon footprint by rural residents is also smaller than that by urban residents, so is the embodied carbon footprint. For urban residents, the percentage of carbon footprint due to food consumption is close to that of rural residents. For rural residents, food, residence and transport & communications are three top categories of embodied carbon footprint.

Presently, under the pressure of climate change and international carbon emission reduction, how to coordinate the relationship between economic development and urban environmental protection, promote carbon emission reduction and develop low-carbon economy has been a hot multi-disciplinary topic. Urban system is an ecosystem that is profoundly impacted by human activities on the earth, in which land use and land cover changes drastically. With much human energy consumption and carbon emission, urban carbon cycle will inevitably have a profound impact on global carbon cycle and climate change. So, urban carbon cycle plays an important role in regional and global carbon cycle processes. Research on urban carbon cycle is not only the important basis for establishing low-carbon urban strategies, but also the theoretical reference for choosing low-carbon city pattern. Firstly, the concept of ""natural-social dualistic carbon cycle"" of urban system was put forward and analyzed, and the circulation process map of urban system was established. It shows that the carbon cycle process of urban system was quite different from that of natural ecosystem. Further, the main characteristics of urban carbon cycle were discussed in this paper. Generally, urban system is a complex system that includes natural and anthropogenic processes, horizontal and vertical processes, surface and underground processes, economic and social processes. Secondly, the mechanism of carbon cycle in urban system was discussed from several aspects, such as: the main processes of carbon storage and carbon input & output fluxes, life cycle of carbon storage, carbon fluxes and carbon circulation processes, carbon input & output types of urban system, etc. In this section, the processes of carbon storage and carbon fluxes of urban system were emphasized in details for better understanding the process of urban carbon cycle. The life cycle analysis of carbon storage, carbon flux and carbon circulation processes gave us a clear idea on how to control the important carbon emission reduction sections. Thirdly, the research framework of carbon cycle in urban system was established according to systematic division and carbon circulation process analysis. Based on the analysis of carbon processes in urban system, the urban system was divided into several social-economic subsystems (such as industrial, commercial, residential, transportation and office subsystems) and natural subsystems (such as water body, farmland, forest, pasture land and urban greenbelt, etc.). Furthermore, the carbon circulation processes between urban system and external system, and the carbon processes between urban natural ecosystems and social-economic systems were analyzed, and the theoretical framework of urban carbon cycle research was established. Finally, the future research trends of urban carbon cycle were put forward, such as: building systematic urban carbon cycle model, establishing urban carbon emission factor database and calculation criterion, promoting contrast studies on carbon cycle and circulation mode of cities under different developing levels, strengthening control and management of key processes in carbon cycle of urban system.","Carbon cycle; Carbon flux; Carbon storage; Life cycle; Natural-social dualistic carbon cycle; Urban system","agricultural land; carbon cycle; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; economic analysis; energy conservation; environmental protection; human activity; land cover; land use change; life cycle; soil type; theoretical study; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873563533

A new approach based on Air Pollution Index (API) data is introduced to adjust the coefficients of A-P equation in this study. Based on daily solar radiation, sunshine hours and API data at nine meteorological stations from 2001 to 2011 in China, linear, exponential and logarithmic models are developed and validated. When evaluated by performance indicators of mean bias error, mean absolute bias error, mean percentage error, mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error, and Nash-Sutcliffe Equation, it is demonstrated that logarithmic model performed better than the other models. Then empirical coefficients for three models are given for each station and the variations of these coefficients are affected by API, geographical position, and altitude. This indicates that aerosol can play an important role in estimation solar radiation from sunshine hours, especially in those highly polluted regions. Finally, a countrywide general equation is established based on the sunshine hour data, API and geographical parameters, which can be used to estimate the daily solar radiation in areas where the radiation data is not available. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The heavy duty HEVs engaged in cycles characterized by start-stop configuration has attracted widely interests, especially in off-road applications. In this paper, a fuzzy equivalent consumption minimization strategy (F-ECMS) is proposed as an intelligent real-time energy management solution for heavy duty HEVs. The online optimization problem is formulated as minimizing a cost function, in terms of weighted fuel power and electrical power. A fuzzy rule-based approach is applied on the weight tuning within the cost function, with respect to the variations of the battery state-of-charge (SOC) and elapsed time. Comparing with traditional real-time supervisory control strategies, the proposed F-ECMS is more robust to the test environments with rapid dynamics. The proposed method is validated via simulation under two transient test cycles, with the fuel economy benefits of 4.43% and 6.44%, respectively.

However, it is not clear how independent small-scale plant communities affected the microclimate. In this paper, the effects of fifteen plant communities on temperature and relative humidity were investigated from November 2010 to October 2011 in urban parks in subtropical Shenzhen City, China. The canopy density, canopy area, tree height and the background climate conditions under plant communities were measured. The effects of small-scale plant communities on temperature and relative humidity were the most significant at 1400-1500. h during the day. The temperature reduction and relative humidity increase due to small-scale plant communities were higher in summer, followed by autumn, spring and winter. As compared to the control open sites, the temperature reduction due to plant communities ranged from 2.14. °C to 5.15. °C, and the relative humidity increase ranged from 6.21% to 8.30%. We found that multilayer plant communities were the most effective in terms of their cooling and humidifying effect, while bamboo groves were the least effective. Regression results revealed that four factors, namely canopy density, canopy area, tree height and solar radiation, had significant influence on temperature reduction and relative humidity increase. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","Microclimate; Plant community structure; Small-scale plant landscape; Urban greening","bamboo; canopy; community structure; cooling; heat island; height; microclimate; plant community; relative humidity; solar radiation; temperature effect; vegetation; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881555803

It is defined as the sum of carbon releases as gaseous products in the microbial decomposition of soil carbon pool. Soil heterotrophic respiration plays a critical role in regulating the global carbon cycle and is potentially sensitive to climate changes in the future. The alpine area of southwestern China is one of the most sensitive areas to climate change. Therefore, it is of great importance to investigate the response of soil heterotrophic respiration to climate in this region for evaluating the contribution of regional carbon cycle to global climate changes. A process-based biogeochemical model CEVSA (Carbon Exchange between Vegetation, Soil, and the Atmosphere) was used to estimate the temporal and spatial variations of soil heterotrophic respiration (HR) in alpine area of southwestern China during the period from 1954 to 2010. We conducted CEVSA model with observation-based data sets of climate (ten days mean value of temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and cloudiness), atmospheric CO2 concentration, and soil and vegetation distribution at a spatial resolution of 0. 1°. Using the climate, vegetation and soil data, firstly, we ran the model with the average climate data from 1954 to 2010 until an ecological equilibrium was reached, then conducted dynamic simulations with climate data at a time-step of ten days from 1954 to 2010. Also, the correlation coefficients between soil HR and climate variables were calculated to analyze the response of soil heterotrophic respiration to climate change. To achieve the results, various kinds of computer software were used, such as ANUSPLIN4. 1, Fortran 90, Arcgis 9.3, SPSS18. 0. The results showed that: (1) The mean values of soil HR density was 422 g C· m-2· a-1 during the period of 1954-2010 in alpine area of southwestern China. The soil HR showed a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest and had significant positive correlation with both annual mean temperature (r = 0. 721,P &lt; 0. 01) and annual totalprecipitation (r = 0. 564,P &lt; 0. 01). (2)Total annual soil HR showed an increasing trend with the rate of 0. 710 Tg C/ a (P&lt;0. 05), and varied between 197 and 251 Tg C/ a. The increasing rate was 1. 621, 1. 496 and 1. 055 g C· m-2· a-2 in grassland, evergreen coniferous forest and evergreen broad-leaved forest (P&lt;0. 01), which were three main vegetation types in alpine area of southwestern China, respectively. (3) Annual variation of soil HR was mainly influenced by temperature. The temperature sensitivity of soil HR (Q10) in the high-elevation northwestern areas was higher than that in the low-elevation southeastern areas, and it is 2. 35, 2. 34 and 1. 93 in grassland, evergreen coniferous forest and evergreen broad-leaved forest in this area, respectively. Soil heterotrophic respiration is an extremely complex process involving a variety of biological and non-biological factors. Climate and vegetation changed with topography and high space heterogeneity existed in alpine area of southwestern China. For these reasons, we suggest that the model resolution should be improved and validation of the simulation result should be strengthened in future to reduce uncertainty.","Alpine area; CEVSA model; Climate change; Heterotrophic respiration","alpine environment; biogeochemistry; broad-leaved forest; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate change; climate effect; concentration (composition); coniferous forest; data set; decomposition; evergreen forest; grassland; heterogeneity; heterotrophy; microbial activity; numerical model; software; soil respiration; spatiotemporal analysis; topographic effect; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881648545

Compared with the simulations at 12- and 4-km, the 1.33-km simulation shows large improvement in most meteorological predictions in July and some chemical predictions in January and July 2002. Limited improvements at 1.33-km and 4-km are attributed to current limitations in meteorological parameterizations and lack of accurate data for land use and emissions at a fine scale. NH3 plays an important role in PM2.5 formation, but the emission control strategies focus only on SO2 and NOx in the southeastern U.S. To understand the impact of NH3, NH3 to NH4+ conversion and the chemical regimes of PM2.5 formation are examined. The conversion rates of NH3 to NH4+ from CMAQ and CAMx simulations are 10-60% in January and 10-50% in July at and near major sources. The eastern North Carolina and northeastern Georgia are NH3-rich and the remaining areas are NH3-neutral in both months. To further assess the impact of NH3 emission reductions, the sensitivity of CMAQ to emission reductions is evaluated for four emission scenarios: reducing emissions of SO2, NOx, agricultural livestock-NH3 (AL-NH3) by 50%, respectively and collectively. The largest reductions of PM2.5 are by up to 19.2% in January and 18.3% in July when all these emissions are reduced by 50%. AL-NH3 reductions result in the largest decrease in January by up to 16%, dominated by a reduction in NH4NO3, while SO2 reductions result in the largest decrease in July (up to 11%) due to decreases in NH4+ and SO42-. This indicates that reducing AL-NH3 emissions together with SO2 and NOx emissions can reduce PM2.5 concentrations more than reducing emissions of SO2 and NOx alone, particularly in winter. Future emission control strategies for PM2.5 controlling should consider the reduction of NH3 emissions, in addition to the emissions of SO2 and NOx. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","CAMx; CMAQ; Emission reduction; Fine scale modeling; Sensitivity simulation","CAMx; CMAQ; Emission reduction; Fine-scale; Sensitivity Simulation; Agriculture; Air quality; Aluminum; Emission control; Forecasting; Public policy; Sulfur dioxide; Reduction; agricultural emission; air quality; ecological impact; emission control; land use; simulation; winter; Georgia; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885026614

For some reservoirs only heterogeneous samples are available for measurement. Heterogeneity, such as layering or cross bedding lamination can commonly be seen in sandstone cores. The effects and mechanism of core-scale heterogeneities on macroscopic scale relative permeability must be well-addressed. Here we report two sets of laboratory core flooding experiments using Berea sandstone for steady-state measurement of relative permeability of CO2/Brine at reservoir condition [1]. Berea sandstone is relatively homogeneous but has strong bedding or lamination structures. Two Berea samples were used (cored along the directions parallel to and perpendicular to the bedding, and named Berea-1 and Berea-2 respectively). We recorded the pressure and discharge volume to get the relative permeability curves for both samples; and utilized the X-ray computed tomography to estimate the distributions of porosity and CO2 (or Brine) saturation for Berea-2. The measured phase relative permeability of Berea-2 sample is greatly deviated from Berea-1. To further investigate the effects of core-scale heterogeneity on the measurement of relative permeability, we carried out a series numerical simulation on core scale using Tough2ECO2N code with building models based on X-ray CT scan images. By comparing the numerical results, we found the heterogeneity of capillary pressure field under one injection direction plays a dominant role in CO2/brine saturation patterns, flow regime and apparent relative permeability model.","Capillary pressure; Heterogeneity; Numerical simulation; Relative permeability",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898713776

We examine trends in Hg precipitationconcentrations at 47 Mercury Deposition Network (MDN) sites during 2004-2010 by using the GEOS-Chem nested-grid Hg simulation. We run the model with constant anthropogenic emissions and subtract the model results from the observations. This helps to remove the variability in observed Hg concentrations caused by meteorological factors, including precipitation. We find significant decreasing trends in Hg concentrations in precipitation at MDN sites in the Northeast (-4.1 ±0.49% yr-1) and Midwest (-2.7±0.68% yr-1). Over the Southeast (-0.53 ±0.59% yr-1), trends are weaker and not significant, while over the West, trends are highly variable. We conduct model simulations assuming a 45% decrease in Hgemissions from domestic sources in the modeled period and a uniform 12% decrease in background atmospheric Hg concentrations.

A model drug, carvedilol (CAR), was loaded onto c-MCMs via a procedure involving a combination of adsorption equilibrium and solvent evaporation. The physicochemical properties of the drug-loaded composites were systematically studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and HPLC. It was found that c-MCM has a high drug loading level up to 41.6%, and higher than that of the mesoporous silica template. Incorporation of CAR in both drug carriers enhanced the solubility and dissolution rate of the drug, compared to the pure crystalline drug. After loading CAR into c-MCMs, its oral bioavailability was compared with the marketed product in dogs. The results showed that the bioavailability of CAR was improved 179.3% compared with that of the commercial product when c-MCM was used as the drug carrier. We believe that the present study will help in the design of oral drug delivery systems for enhanced oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This co-benefit analysis used the Ambient Least Cost Model (ALC) to estimate PM10and CO2emission reduction and cost, then developed a PM10and CO2control technologies inventory. The results show that a rebuilt bag-house precipitator in 300 MW units is most cost-effective method of reducing PM10emissions in a thermal power plant. In contrast, CCS-MEA is the most effective option for reducing CO2emissions in the existing plant. The results of the cost-benefit analysis indicated that using a Nuclear Power plant is the most cost effective way to reduce PM10and CO2emissions at the same time, but IGCC is a safer choice for Tianjin. The integrated environmental strategy (IES) scenario presented in this work makes it possible to reduce CO2emissions by 28,095,386 t and PM10emissions by 35,930.73 t, at a cost of 9.69 billion Yuan from 2010 to 2015, which is better than both suggested targets (ST) for PM10and CO2during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan.

Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a promising combustion technology with inherent separation of CO2. Calcium sulfate (CaSO4) can be used as a new oxygen carrier in this system. In CLC, CaSO4 is reduced to calcium sulfide (CaS) in the fuel reactor firstly. Then CaS is oxygenated to CaSO4 back in the air reactor. The decomposition of CaSO4 is usually accompanied by some side reactions, and the products depended on the experimental conditions. In this paper, the decomposition mechanism of CaSO4 reduced by methane (CH4) was investigated in the frame of density functional theory (DFT). In the calculation, the exchange-correlation term was approximated by Perdew-Wang (PW91) equation, a function within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) family. To understand the interaction between CH4 and CaSO4, the reaction pathways and TSs of CaSO4 decomposition were investigated and identified. The calculated results showed that, in the interaction of CaSO4 and CH4, electrons were transferred from sp3 hybrid orbital to O p state and S s state when CH4 was activated. C-H bond and S-O bond were activated and stretched with the electron transfer, which resulted in the dissociation of S-O bond finally. The objective product CaS could be obtained with the reductive decomposition of CaSO4 by CH4. A probably mechanism was proposed, that is, the reaction process of CaSO4 and CH4 is CH4 + CaSO4 → CH3OH + CaSO3 → CH2OOH + CaSO2H → HCHO + H2O + CaSO2 → HCOOH + H2O + CaSO → 2H2O + CO2 + CaS. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional Portland cement production seems unsustainable due to consumption of huge natural resources and energy and significant CO 2 emissions. The volume of industrial wastes is increasing significantly, leading to a number of economical and ecological problems. Although industrial wastes can be incorporated in cementitious materials by various traditional methods, the substitution ratio of industrial wastes in cementitious materials is relatively low to avoid unacceptable performance loss. Novel methods, such as improving hydraulic activities of metallurgical slags by adding composition adjusting material at high temperature, improving surface cementitious properties of fly ashes by dehydration and rehydration treatment, and arranging cement clinker and industrial wastes in the particle size distribution of blended cements according to their hydraulic activities, are reviewed. These methods provide more effective approach to prepare high performance blended cements with larger amount of industrial wastes, leading to a very significant role in CO2 emissions reducing, resources and energy conservation of the cement industry. © 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Blended cement; Effectiveness; Environmental benefit; Industrial waste; Pozzolanic activity","Blended cement; Cementitious materials; Cementitious properties; Effective approaches; Effectiveness; Environmental benefits; Metallurgical slags; Pozzolanic activity; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Fly ash; Industrial waste treatment; Industrial wastes; Particle size analysis; Portland cement; Slags; Ashes; carbon dioxide; cement; coal; cement; composite; dehydration; emission control; fly ash; high temperature; hydraulics; industrial waste; metallurgy; particle size; recycling; rehydration; slag; sustainable development; cement industry; chemical composition; chemical engineering; chemical reaction; cost benefit analysis; energy conservation; environmental monitoring; fly ash; furnace; incineration; industrial waste; mine tailings; municipal solid waste; particle size; process development; process optimization; review; slag; solid waste management; waste management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876102592

The samples were determined for various compositions, including elements, ions, and organic/elemental carbon. Various approaches, such as chemical mass balance, positive matrix factorization (PMF), trajectory clustering, and potential source contribution function (PSCF), were employed for characterizing aerosol speciation, identifying likely sources, and apportioning contributions from each likely source. Our results have shown distinctive seasonality for various aerosol speciations associated with PM2.5 in Beijing. Soil dust waxes in the spring and wanes in the summer. Regarding the secondary aerosol components, inorganic and organic species may behave in different manners. The former preferentially forms in the hot and humid summer via photochemical reactions, although their precursor gases, such as SO2 and NOx, are emitted much more in winter. The latter seems to favorably form in the cold and dry winter. Synoptic meteorological and climate conditions can overwhelm the emission pattern in the formation of secondary aerosols. The PMF model identified six main sources: soil dust, coal combustion, biomass burning, traffic and waste incineration emission, industrial pollution, and secondary inorganic aerosol. Each of these sources has an annual mean contribution of 16, 14, 13, 3, 28, and 26%, respectively, to PM2.5. However, the relative contributions of these identified sources significantly vary with changing seasons. The results of trajectory clustering and the PSCF method demonstrated that regional sources could be crucial contributors to PM pollution in Beijing. In conclusion, we have unraveled some complex aspects of the pollution sources and formation processes of PM2.5 in Beijing. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study that comprehensively explores the chemical characterizations and source apportionments of PM2.5 aerosol speciation in Beijing by applying multiple approaches based on a completely seasonal perspective. © Author(s) 2013.",,"aerodynamics; aerosol; aerosol composition; biomass burning; combustion; dust; photochemistry; point source; reaction kinetics; seasonal variation; speciation (chemistry); Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880869760

There are so many factors influencing the image intensifier performance, and the first proximity voltage is one of the most important factors that can not be ignored. Based on the theory analysis and test of different proximity voltage on the gain, signal-to-noise ratio and equivalent background noise, this test has studied on the important performance of Gen III image intensifier effected by the proximity voltage. By the experimental study, the increase of first proximity voltage to a certain extent can improve gain, signal-to-noise ratio and equivalent background noise at the same time. The main cause of this phenomenon is that the increase of proximity voltage can enlarge the incident electron energy, and then improve the quantum efficiency of the incident electron; meantime, stray electron produced by field emission at the action of the electric field of filmed-MCP will lead to equivalent background deterioration. Ultimately we conclude that: 1) Signal to noise is proportional to the square of he cathode sensitivity, increases with the first collision energy of the incident electron, especially at 200-500ev. 2)In the increasing process of voltage from 300v to 800v, the gain of filmed-MCP increases rapidly, but lower again when Upk increases further because of gain self-saturation; lgG and lgUpkare linear relationship, thus the curve can intuitively demonstrate the relationship between them. 3) Stray electron produced by field emission at the action of the electric field of filmed-MCP will lead to equivalent background deterioration, but will not exceed the requirements of technical specifications(2.5×10-7lx). © 2013 SPIE.","Equivalent background noise; First proximity voltage; Gain; Signal-to-noise ratio","Background noise; Collision energies; Gain; Gen III image intensifier; Incident electrons; Linear relationships; Low-light-level image; Technical specifications; Deterioration; Electric fields; Electrons; Field emission; Field emission cathodes; Image intensifiers (solid state); Signal to noise ratio; Image storage tubes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897905248

The relationship between plant functional traits and environmental change is easier to measure with consistent phylogeny. In the study reported here we analyzed the source of variation of six plant functional traits in 47 species from 19 sample sites in the Yanhe river watershed of China. The 19 sample sites surveyed in this study were selected based on the climatic gradient, as represented by vegetation zonality. The six plant functional traits investigated were specific leaf area (SLA), specific root length (SRL), and the mass-based characteristics of leaf nitrogen concentration (LN), leaf phosphorus concentration (LP), root nitrogen concentration (RN), and root phosphorus concentration (RP). To analyze the impact of environmental change on variation in plant traits, we also selected terrain factors and soil moisture content as environmental variables. We then used variance analysis to differentiate the relative influence of phylogenetic background (as represented by plant family), climatic conditions, terrain factors, and soil moisture content on trait variation, and used a stepwise regression method to analyze the response of traits to environmental change in plants sharing a similar hereditary background. Our results include the following observations: (1) significant differences were uncovered with respect to SLA, LN, and RP under different climatic conditions. We found that SLA and RP of forest plants were 33% and 20% higher respectively, than SLA and RP of steppe plants, whereas LN of plants from steppe sites was 19% higher than that of plants from forest sites. Significant differences were also detected in SLA, SRL, LN, and RN among different families. Average SLA, LN, and RN values measured from Leguminosae species were 16%, 65% and 98% higher respectively, than average values obtained for all studied plants. Species from the family Poaceae had the highest SRL, which was 1.03-fold higher than the overall average; (2) variation of plant functional traits was mainly determined by plant phylogenetic background, which accounted for 27.86, 32.78, and 42.70% of observed variation in SRL, LN, and RN, respectively. On the other hand, LP and RP were mainly influenced by the environment, which accounted for 24% and 15.58%, respectively, of observed variation in LP and RP; (3) stepwise linear regression models revealed that species from different families responded differently to environmental factors. Members of the families Leguminosae and Poaceae were more sensitive to regional hydrothermal conditions, whereas Asteraceae and Rosaceae species were more strongly affected by local microenvironments. After removing influences attributable to phylogenetic background, we were able to clearly and reliably discern relationships between functional traits and the environment. In the Yanhe river watershed, plant phosphorus content was mainly determined by terrain factors and soil moisture content. In contrast, plant nitrogen content, SLA, and SRL were mainly affected by plant phylogenetic background. To summarize, plant phylogenetic background plays a controlling role in the influence of the environment on plant traits in the Yanhe river watershed of China.","Functional trait; Genetic background; Phylogenetic background; Response to environment","adaptation; climate change; dicotyledon; environmental change; functional role; legume; moisture content; phylogenetics; phylogeny; root system; soil moisture; steppe; watershed; China; Shaanxi; Yanhe Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887286175

Two keys to improving the management of urban forest ecosystems are an understanding of their structure and its relationship to forest functions, and coordination of the management of the multiple functions of urban forests. As green infrastructure is an important part of urban systems, urban forests can provide a variety of ecosystem services. With rapid urbanization, increasing numbers of urban dwellers are facing health problems caused by environmental pollution. Therefore, the beneficial impacts of urban forests on human health have attracted increasing attention. Extensive development in Shanghai during the last few decades has led to rapid urbanization. The Shanghai Green Belt, with its many species and diverse vegetation types, is an important part of Shanghai's urban forests. After more than 10 years of construction and development, the Green Belt has become a major attraction for people who desire green space for recreation and relaxation, and it continues to have a positive role in the protection and promotion of the health of urban residents. Since the Green Belt landscape has increased in importance, its function in promoting human health should be evaluated to optimize its structure and to promote both its ecological functions and the related benefits it provides to people. Many research studies have demonstrated that the functions of urban forests that promote human health mainly depend on the vegetation type present, the vegetative community components and the structure of the plant communities present. In this study, typical plant communities in the Shanghai Green Belt were selected for analysis of their function in promoting a healthy human environment. This function was evaluated from the aspects of temperature and humidity amelioration, the generation of negative ions, bacteria inhibition, noise reduction, and air pollution reduction in summer and winter. The relationships between functions beneficial to human health and community structural characteristics and factors were analyzed, and the mechanisms influencing the function of forest communities in benefiting human health were explored based on the species composition and structural characteristics of these urban forests. The results showed the Taxodium distichum var. imbricarium Community, a deciduous coniferous forest type, has the best effect on most forest ecosystem functions related to human health with the exception of bacterial inhibition in summer. Two deciduous broad-leaved forest types, the Koelreuteria bipinnata var. integrifoliola Community and the Platanus ×hispanica Community, have the least effect on promoting forested ecosystem functions related to human health, while other community types are in the mid-range. In winter, the evergreen broad-leaved forest Ligustrum lucidum Community has the best effect on such functions, followed by the evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forest Koelreuteria bipinnata var. integrifoliola + Cinnamomum camphora Community and the Populus spp. + Cinnamomum camphora Community, and other communities types that have weaker health-related function effects. Correlation analysis between the functions related to the promotion human health and community structural factors shows leaf area index (LAI) and canopy closure were significantly and positively correlated with health-related functions, and LAI and canopy closure were important structural parameters that indicated the plant community provided important functions related to human health. By quantitatively evaluating the health-related functions of different plant communities in the Shanghai Green Belt, we explore the differences in different community types in the promotion of ecosystem functions related to human health. We also reveal the mechanisms influencing those functions, suggest some strategies related to optimizing plant community structure under specific environmental conditions, and provide a scientific basis for urban forest planning, design, and management.","Health function; Shanghai Green Belt; Structural characteristics; Urban forest","anthropogenic effect; bacterium; community structure; ecosystem function; ecosystem health; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; environmental conditions; infrastructure; inhibition; landscape; plant community; seasonal variation; urban forestry; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880491365

It is needed to explore how a city's energy system evolves and how it can be altered to reduce carbon emissions. This paper analyzed energy consumption and related CO2 emissions in Beijing and Shanghai. A rapid growth in energy consumption during the last two decades is evident. Shanghai presents higher energy intensity than Beijing, mainly due to the larger share of the secondary industry in economy. Energy consumption by the residential sector is higher in Beijing, despite a larger population in Shanghai. The CO2 emissions by the end-use energy in 2010 are 152 and 259 million ton in Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. Electricity usage presents an important share of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Thus, development of renewable energy for electricity generation and improvement of the technologies in thermal power plants are important to reduce the future carbon emissions. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Beijing; Carbon emission; Energy; Shanghai","Beijing; Carbon emissions; Electricity generation; Energy; Rapid urbanizations; Residential sectors; Shanghai; Thermal power plants; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Thermoelectric power plants; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876931522

The results showed that Cinnamonum campora (L.) Pres has the highest carbon fixation ((11.374±1.020) g·m-2·d-1), followed by Amygdalus persica var. persica f. duplex, Salix babylonica L., Lithocarpus glaber, Sapindus mukorossi Gaertn and others, and Prunus cerasifera f. atropurpurea has the lowest ((2.178±0.605) g·m-2·d-1). Cinnamonum campora (L.) Prels. has significantly higher net sequestered carbon (P&lt;0.05) than Prunus cerasifera f. Atropurpurea. The physiological characteristics of these trees further reflect their growth adaptability and carbon sequestration capacity in northern Zhejiang province. According to the results of factor analysis and Ward cluster analysis, Cinnamonum campora (L.) Prels. and Amygdalus persica var. persica f. duplex have better growth adaptability, followed by Sapindus mukorossi Gaertn, Salix babylonica L., Ligustrum lucidum. Therefore, these tree species are recommended for afforestation in northern Zhejiang. Because plant photosynthesis is a complex physiological process, the photosynthetic physiological indicators only show the characteristics of tree species in one aspect, and do not represent the pros and cons of the species. The conclusion obtained from comprehensive multi-index and cluster analysis is consistent with that from diurnal net carbon sequestration analysis, implying that the integrated indicators of physiological parameters can better reflect the relative inferiority of the carbon sequestration capacity. On the view of optimal afforestation tree configuration, more research is needed to combine photosynthesis and regional growth and adaptability of species and to improve their photosynthetic capacities.","Cluster analysis; Diurnal net carbon fixation; Factor analysis; Photosynthetic carbon sequestration; Photosynthetically physiological parameters","adaptation; afforestation; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; cluster analysis; diurnal variation; growth response; light intensity; light use efficiency; photosynthesis; tree; tree planting; China; Zhejiang; Acer; Acer buergerianum; Albizia; Albizia julibrissin; Celtis; Choerospondias axillaris; Diospyros; Elaeocarpus; Ginkgo biloba; Ilex; Koelreuteria; Ligustrum; Ligustrum lucidum; Liquidambar; Liquidambar formosana; Liriodendron; Liriodendron chinense; Lithocarpus glaber; Machilus; Magnolia; Magnolia grandiflora; Magnoliaceae; Michelia chapensis; Michelia maudiae; Nageia nagi; Osmanthus fragrans; Populus; Prunus cerasifera; Prunus persica; Salix; Salix babylonica; Sapindaceae; Sapindus mukorossi; Taxodium; Taxodium distichum; Zelkova schneideriana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876052582

Taking 1995-2000, 2000-2005, and 2005-2009 as the study periods, we decomposed the effects of changes in carbon emissions resulting from eight causal factors using the logarithmic mean divisia index method: economic activity and population size, which reflect the change in socioeconomic activity; energy intensity and energy consumption per capita, which reflect the change in the intensity of energy use; and economic structure, the urban and rural population distribution structure, and the energy mix of the production and household sectors, which reflect structural changes. We found that in all three study periods, the changes in economic activity, population size, and energy consumption per capita stimulated emissions, whereas the changes in energy intensity, the urban and rural population distribution structure, and the energy mix of the production and household sectors decreased emissions. In contrast, changes in the economic structure decreased emissions in the first and third periods, and increased emissions in the second period. Our results clearly indicate that under current practices, carbon emissions will increase as a result of rapid growth of the economy, the population, and the energy consumption per capita. In the future, the main routes to reduce carbon emissions will be to adjust the economic structure and energy mix, and to reduce the energy intensity of each sector. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Beijing; Carbon emissions; Energy and the environment; Factor decomposition","Climate change; Economic analysis; Economics; Population distribution; Population statistics; Beijing; Carbon emissions; Divisia index method; Economic activities; Economic structure; Energy and the environment; Factor decompositions; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Energy utilization; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; economic activity; economic growth; economic structure; environmental economics; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; population distribution; population size; rural population; socioeconomic conditions; temporal analysis; urban population; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888114439

Determining how the vegetation cover and carbon sink changed before and after Beijing Olympics is the main objective. The land cover data and net primary production (NPP) data from 2001 to 2010 from MODIS product were used. Through the method of average carbon sink efficiency, we get the following result. From 2001 to 2007, the carbon sink is gradually reducing. In 2008, it suddenly rises then keeps stable. The average forest carbon sink of Beijing between 2001 and 2010 is 136 kt, while average forest carbon sink between 2008 and 2010 is 159 kt. The average overall carbon sink of Beijing between 2001 and 2010 is 260 kt, and 277 kt between 2008 and 2010. The reducing carbon sink from 2001 to 2007 has a linear relationship with the reducing vegetation coverage. In 2008, the sudden rise of carbon sink on one hand has something to do with the increased vegetation coverage and transformation of forest from young to grown-up. But mostly it may be a result of the macro-control by the government as importing big trees into the city.

As a fundamental infrastructure to sustain human activities and civil development, wastewater pipeline networks are receiving attention in the context of population growth and industrial expansion in urban areas. It is therefore quite challenging to analyze the environmental impact of wastewater pipeline projects and explore effective construction methods and strategies. A model to estimate CO2 emissions resulting from a typical wastewater pipeline project was developed based on life cycle theory. Wastewater pipeline construction emissions are divided into three categories: 1) material manufacture; 2) material transportation; and 3) pipe installation. The methodology for estimating CO2 emissions is demonstrated using a wastewater pipeline project in Suzhou, China. The results concluded that the materials consumed most by weight are sand, cement, cohesive brick, gravel, limestone, and UPVC pipe. It was also found that most of the emissions from material manufacturing were from UPVC pipe, which provide an insight into revealing the elements with significant reduction potential. CO2 emissions released by producing material accounted for approximately 87% of total emissions, while the emissions released in the other two categories were less than 13%. The unit CO2 emission of the studied wastewater pipeline construction project using traditional open-cut methods was 516.59 t CO2/km. This provides a reference for estimating CO2 emissions resulting from other wastewater pipeline projects. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineering.","CO2 emission; emissions factors; Wastewater pipeline","Civil development; Construction method; Emissions factors; Industrial expansion; Life cycle theories; Material transportation; Reduction potential; Wastewater pipelines; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Environmental impact; Estimation; Global warming; Manufacture; Pipeline laying; Population statistics; Water pipelines; Trenching",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876157436

Some models have been used to simulate the relationship between land use and land cover change and climate change; however, there is still no sufficient evidence for the impacts of urbanization on the regional climate. This study aims to identify the impact of urban land use change on regional temperature and precipitation in summer in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Metropolitan area during 2030-2040 based on the analysis of the simulation results of WRF model. Firstly, we analyzed the land use change and climate change during 1995-2005 in the study area. The impacts of future urbanization on regional climate change were then simulated. The results indicate that urbanization in this area has affected the regional climate and has the potential to increase temperature and precipitation in the summer of 2030-2040. These research results can offer decision-making support information related to future planning strategies in urban environments in consideration of regional climate change. © 2013 Jinyan Zhan et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890100257

The amounts of energy used and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted largely depend on the water source, quality of raw water, the treatment process employed and the local electricity mix. Groundwater is the primary source for potable water supply at city of Clearwater. Since the local groundwater has elevated total dissolved solids (TDS) from shallow wells and salinity of water extracted from deep wells (called brackish water) is high, alternative water treatment processes such as reverse osmosis (RO) for brackish water treatment and alternate water sources such as reclaimed water, for nonpotable purposes, are considered. In City of Clearwater, the water systems are managed in an integrated approach, called integrated water management system (IWM), as water treatment and water reclamation facilities (wastewater treatment plants) are managed and controlled under the same agency. The goal of this study is to conduct a life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the life cycle energy and GHG emissions of the whole integrated water system. In this study, the energy intensity of an advanced treatment process, RO, employed for brackish water treatment was compared to the conventional groundwater treatment, and the benefits of resource recovery in terms of the amount of energy recovered and the GHG emissions avoided were determined. Current resource recovery practices at City of Clearwater system include water reclamation, methane production for heating the sludge and sludge land application. Life cycle inventory data was collected from each plant including the types and amounts of chemicals used as well as the electricity consumed at the plant. Water-Energy Sustainability Tool (WEST) tool was used as an analytical software. The results show that wastewater treatment process has the highest GHG emissions and life cycle energy consumption followed by water treatment process. The main contributor to life cycle energy and GHG emissions at wastewater treatment process is electricity consumption followed by chemical consumption. For the water treatment process, electricity consumption is the dominant contributor for GHG emissions but chemical consumption is the main contributor for life cycle energy consumption. The results for water treatment plants show that the life cycle energy and GHG emissions of the RO plant are higher than those of other two water treatment plants while the results of water reclamation facilities show that all three plants are having similar energy consumption and GHG emissions rates. Resource recovery practices, such as water reclamation, methane generation at anaerobic digesters, and dewatered sludge land application, could save noticeable amount of energy and GHG emissions.

There is no universal definition for the term “Shale” as it is used today: Shales as they are used nowadays encompass a wide range of compositions. This inconsistency arises mostly due to the lack of a more general term. Presence of clay minerals and organic matter combined with submicron grain sizes and nano scale pore diameters has demanded new techniques and technologies for exploration, reservoir characterization and production from these resources. Many of shale formations are the source rocks for conventional accumulations which store considerable volume of non-expelled hydrocarbon. Target zones in self-resourcing petroleum systems differ depending on the organic content, level of organic maturity, and kerogen type. At high TOC and low maturity levels, source rocks have very small effective porosity and sub-economical permeability. Hydrocarbon production from these resources requires in situ retort techniques. At high maturity level (gas condensate and dry gas window) economic hydrocarbon production occurs mostly as a result of higher effective porosity and smaller hydrocarbon molecular sizes. The process of thermal maturation results in alteration of the physical properties of the kerogen and consequently the petrophysical properties of organic rich shale hosting the kerogen. Thermal maturation controls the storage capacities and hydrocarbon expulsion of the rocks. In order to use seismic and log measurements to locate organic rich rocks and to determine thermal maturity, we must understand organic richness and effect of maturation byproducts on petrophysical properties and seismic response of these sediments. In this paper, we present our observations and analysis of some major petrophysical properties of organic rich rocks at different maturity levels. We found significant textural differences and mineral re-orientations in more mature rocks in comparison with immature shales. Laminated kerogen particles and clay minerals appear to be load bearing in immature state; they become more isolated, scattered and randomly oriented at higher maturity levels which decreases the anisotropy. Volume changes in kerogen also cause significant differences in bulk mechanical properties of the rock. Bitumen is produced at the early stages of maturation and significantly affects effective porosity. Bitumen occupies most of the porosity between clay minerals and intraparticle pores inside organic matter at early stages of oil generation. Lack of an exact cut off between fluid/movable organic matter and solid/part of the matrix organic components makes defining porosity a very challenging and subjective task. The textural observations were integrated with analysis of a composite data set from the Bakken petroleum system that consists of well logs, RockEval, and mineralogy. These analyses help to understand how organic rich sediments evolve with burial and maturation and how hydrocarbons are stored and transported to sustain large storage, even at high overburden stresses. © Copyright 2013, Unconventional Resources Technology Conference (URTeC)",,"Biogeochemistry; Clay minerals; Digital storage; Gas condensates; Gasoline; Kerogen; Mineral exploration; Nanotechnology; Oil shale; Oil well logging; Particle size analysis; Petroleum analysis; Petroleum geology; Petroleum prospecting; Petrophysics; Porosity; Resource valuation; Seismology; Shale; Thermal logging; Bulk mechanical properties; Hydrocarbon expulsion; Hydrocarbon production; Organic-rich sediment; Organic-rich shales; Petrophysical analysis; Petrophysical properties; Reservoir characterization; Organic minerals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086056932

Manufacturers have been offering a wide range of efficient and lower emission vehicles to fulfil these Regulations. Besides commercial vehicles, it it's also important to consider the use and implementation of hybrid urban buses because it is a massive way of transportation that is used every day in the bigger cities. The use of hybrid urban buses is significant to achieve the goal for lower emissions and better energy efficiency, due to the city utilization involves several stops and accelerations. This paper considers the comparison between the results obtained from software simulation of a complete in-series hybrid urban bus platform (develop under AVL Cruise® software) and the data obtained from real on-board measurements made in the city of Madrid. The model involves an in-series hybrid electric bus, meaning that the propulsion system is supplied by an electric motor which receives energy from a stored source (battery).

The traffic flow profiles of the modelled road network were included in the air pollution model and their impact on the model results, after the application of the calibration approach, was investigated. The inclusion of the traffic flow profiles reduced further the error between the hourly, but not the annual means of, calculated and monitored concentrations.","Background concentrations; Calibration; Modelling and air pollution; Validation","air quality; atmospheric pollution; calibration; concentration (composition); dispersion; model validation; numerical model; traffic emission; England; Nottingham [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880658179

Prior knowledge of hourly, daily, and weekly levels of pollution can assist urban planners in policy and management procedures. Moreover, predictions using large-scale pollution forecasting systems, such as the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition & Climate program and the obsAIRve project, can be supported at the local scale by a statistical model using historical data from ground stations. An example of the use of historical data from ground stations is provided in the previous work of Chiera et al., [2010] in which forecasts of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, represented by a two-state digital signal of the atmospheric pressure, were provided. Key to these forecasts was the concept of persistence, introduced to capture the observed behaviour of the digital signal remaining in one state for a prolonged time, before switching to the other state. This persistent behaviour was captured using Bayesian statistics to yield the CFZG Model, that is an adaptive Bayesian single-indicator forecasting model of a quasi-stochastic climate process. In this paper we augment the methodology of Chiera et al., [2010] to produce a multi-indicator model to predict pollution levels at measuring stations located in 36 European nations, based on observed persistent behaviour in air quality. An attractive feature of the adapted usage of the CFZG model is that it can be applied to multiple pollutant signals including all of the primary European pollutants such as Nitrous Oxides, Particulate Matter, Volatile Organic Compounds and Ozone. Unlike the single-indicator CFZG model, which used measuring stations from two locations only, we use measuring stations for pollutant signals which are geographically disparate, located in both rural and urban sites across 36 countries, all of which are registered with the European Environmental Agency. We present examples of typical nitrous oxide and ozone levels across selected sites and forecasting results for our chosen case study - rural Bosnia-Herzegovina - and compare the forecast against a control test that uses a random signal. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Air Quality; Bayesian; Forecasting; Modelling; Persistence; Statistics","Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric pressure; Climate models; Forecasting; Models; Nitrogen oxides; Operations research; Ozone; Statistics; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Urban growth; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality forecasting; Bayesian; Environmental agency; Forecasting modeling; Management procedures; Persistence; Southern oscillation; Statistical persistence; Weather forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080923867

A detailed account of works on single- and multielectron reduction of planar and curved polyarenes is given based on structural considerations. First, a wealth of structurally characterized examples of alkali metal complexes with planar polyaromatic hydrocarbons having fused six-membered rings only and a mix of six- and five-membered ring systems is presented. This follows by the discussion of coordination preferences of negatively charged geodesic polyarenes that include fullerene fragments (also referred to as buckybowls or π-bowls) and fullerenes. Only recently, the first anionic products of buckybowls with alkali metal counterions have been isolated in the solid state and crystallographically characterized. This allowed to reveal the coordination preferences of mono-, di-, and tetrareduced bowl-shaped anions and to evaluate geometric perturbations of their core upon multielectron acquisition. Only a few structurally confirmed examples of fullerene anions isolated from solutions with alkali metal counterions have been so far reported. Their charges range from 1- to 3- only with the highly charged anions of C60 still awaiting their isolation and structural characterization.

While fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas remain the top resources within this particular state, there are new technologies, different approaches and modifications to current power generation cycles, and different fuels that can be presented to gain further reduction of these harmful emissions. To achieve this objective, eight different scenarios were introduced. In the first scenario, existing power stations' fuel was switched to natural gas. Existing power plants were replaced by natural gas combined cycle (NGCC), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), hybrid SOFC, and SOFC-IGCC hybrid power stations in scenarios number 2 to 6, respectively. The last two scenarios involved carbon capture systems.

Distribution transformer with iron-based amorphous metal core is an energy efficient transformer. Core loss from that type of transformer is approximately 25-30% less than conventional type of cold rolled grain oriented silicon steel core (CRGO), namely amorphous core can slash the no-load losses by up to 70% and make possible to build very high effienceny distribution transformer. To reduce the losses of transformer means to contribute to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the production of energy loss. In EU network are about 5 millon distribution transformers and contributing approximately 30 million tons of CO2 emissions. There are more than 2,5 million amorphous metal core distribution transformers (AMDT) in worldwide operations. This paper introduces a brief comparison between conventional distribution transformers and amorphous core distribution transformers. Investigation is carried out on the iron-based amorphous wound core distribution transformer production technology. Amorphous ribbon is relatively thin (22-30 μm), hard, stress-sensitive and requires annealing process under a magnetic field to achieve the optimum performance. Result from that the eddy current losses lower as compared to CRGO and ease of magnetization and demagnetization, also lower hysteresis losses.

The implemented effects and applicable condition of actuated signal control are studied by inspecting the field application and analyzing simulation results of the different intersections under actuated signal control and fixed time control. The simulation results show that at complicated and large intersections, it is better to use the fixed time control. At small or medium sized crossings, the application of actuated signal control can reduce the delay and emissions.

It presents an attempt to calculate the dynamic economic value in the process of vegetation restoration in Xiaoliang, tropical China. The results showed that restoration ecological economic value increased from 509 RMB•hm-2 to 119,070 RMB•hm-2 during the 45 years. With the vegetation restoration went on, the increasing velocity slowed down. In the first 15 years, the velocity was more than 100% and slowed down gradually then after 20 years later. If compared by value construction, the direct economic value increased from 101 RMB•hm-2 to 32,782 RMB•hm-2 during the 45 years, and the indirect economy value increased from 408 RMB•hm-2 to 86288 RMB•hm-2.

And also, the tendency of each value was different, soil conservation service function and the climate regulation were the most remarkable here, after restored for 20 years, the soil conservation remained stable, the soil conservation economy value presented the same tendency, while the value of climate regulation fluctuated after 15 years' restoration. The results suggest that the restoration ecological economic value was a time-dependent, dynamic accumulation consistent with the ecological effect of the restored forest. In addition, the restoration ecological economic value at different ages in a restored forest ecosystem was consistent with the values found for some regional natural forest ecosystems.

Gross primary productivity (GPP), defined as the overall rate of fixation of carbon through the process of vegetation photosynthesis, is the total influx of carbon into an ecosystem. Many remote sensing approaches based on light use efficiency (LUE) model have been developed to estimate GPP at regional or global scale. A standard suite of global products characterizing GPP at the 1km spatial resolution is now being produced operationally based on observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. In this study, we investigated the potential of two normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data sets from global inventory modeling and mapping studies (GIMMS) and MODIS for estimating GPP in Harvard Forest. The result showed that only using NDVI and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) can explain 74% of GPP for this site, which indicates GPP can be predicted by using long time period NDVI data sets at reasonable accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.","GIMMS; GPP; Harvard Forest; MODIS; NDVI","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; GIMMS; GPP; Harvard forests; MODIS; NDVI; Mapping; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Forestry; Mapping",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906898036

The AEES strategy aims at adaptively adjusting voltages according to the system workload, thereby making trade-offs between energy conservation and user expectation. When the system is under heavy workload, to meet user expectations, AEES not only considers the voltage for a new task, but also takes the voltages to run tasks waiting in local queues into account; in contrast, AEES degrades voltage levels to reduce energy consumption while holding higher user satisfaction rate in terms of user expected finish time. The research results show that AEES is able to effectively enhance the system adaptivity, reduce the computation and communication energy cost efficiently and get a good energy saving effect. © Sila Science.","Adaptive energy; Bigdata; Cloud computing datacenters; Economize scheduling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894107494

Methanol is very important due to the current depletion of fossil fuels. Industrially, methanol was produced from the catalytic reaction of syn-thetic gas composed of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. Methanol production has brought great attention due to the carbon dioxide as the main source of greenhouse gas emissions. Combined of reducing CO2 emissions and supplying an alternative fuel source has created the idea of a carbon neutral cycle called ""the methanol economy"". The best catalyst for the methanol economy leads to a high CO2 con-version and high selectivity for methanol production.

Because GHG emissions in the construction industry account for a significant portion (approximately 12.9%) of the total GHG emissions, strategies for reducing GHG emission have been widely explored in the construction sector. However, these attempts have been focused mostly on individual or small construction projects. A systematic approach for managing and monitoring GHG emission factors at the macro level of collective projects must reflect the nature of large-scale construction projects. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for a carbon management system (CMS) for large-scale construction projects, focusing on carbon emissions. A preliminary analysis was conducted via literature review and survey. Based upon the results, a GT-PCM (Green Technology-Plan, Control, and Monitor) framework is proposed for implementing GHG emission policy for the duration of a mega-sized project at the program level that constitutes a complex set of interrelated and connected sub-projects. A case study application to a large-scale urban development project was conducted not only to assess the applicability of the framework but also to identify future research needs to overcome limitations of the current framework.

The construction sector accounts for approximately 40% of global energy usage. Therefore, technological as well as political means have been employed to realize a reduction in energy consumption in this sector. High-efficiency window systems can play an important role in reducing energy consumption in buildings. We measured the thermal performance (U-factor) of different window systems and analyzed their effects on energy savings. All systems considered in this study helped improve insulating performance. Our results showed that the use of temperable, low-e glazed units helped achieve 19.9%, 17.1%, and 15.2% energy savings in the study areas in the central and southern regions in South Korea and in Jeju Island, respectively. Despite the great potential for energy savings in the central region, only half the buildings qualified for Rating 2 certification, whereas all buildings on Jeju Island qualify for the most energy efficient rating. This suggests that the energy efficiency ratings for buildings in South Korea are being applied to these three regions according to the regional building codes and climatic conditions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This engine complies with US Tier 4-final regulation, without PM after-treatment device by virtue of improved combustion strategy which is named as ULPC (Ultra-Low Particulate Combustion). This paper explains how ULPC works to reduce particulate matter (PM) based on the optimization of combustion system - piston bowl and nozzle specification. A baseline, re-entrant shape piston bowl, is useful to improve mixing of fuel and air in the main combustion chamber due to squish jet flow, especially in high-speed diesel engines. However, operating speed of commercial engines is almost half slower than that of passenger car engines and the merits by squish flow become deteriorated. It has another limit to reduce PM due to the fact that most combustion only occurs in main combustion chamber resulting in insufficient use of air in the upper region of the piston. For these reasons, a new piston bowl shape for ULPC has proposed to have a large diameter of piston entrance to use the air in upper region of main combustion bowl. Under ULPC bowl, combustion takes place in the two regions of piston, combustion bowl and upper region of the bowl, resulting from the split of fuel spray. By optimizing spray targeting (in terms of spray angle and bowl design), the amount of fuel split is well matched to the amount of air inside the bowl and upper region of the bowl that leads to maximized local air-fuel ratio and reduced PM. This ULPC strategy is realized by optimized bowl design via computational analysis and engine bench tests. Results of 3-D combustion simulation at rated power operating points explain that the ULPC piston has higher potential to reduce PM by faster soot oxidation through the improved mixing of fuel and air in the combustion chamber, especially during expansion stroke. Two test engines (baseline and ULPC piston bowl installed) were calibrated to find out the best PM emission on the engine dynamometer. Test results depicts that the ULPC piston has improved NOx-PM trade off curve at the all range of engine operation. The result of C1-8 NRSC (Non-Road Steady Cycle test) bench test proves that optimized ULPC strategy reduces over 60% PM as the same NOx level that leads for this engine to the Tier-4 Final emission compliance without DPF.

This makes it more important for operators to determine operational strategies of cogeneration plants appropriately. In this paper, for the purpose of assisting operators or operating plants automatically, an optimal operational planning method based on the mixed-integer linear programming is developed to determine the operational strategy of equipment so as to minimize the operational cost, in consideration of equipment minimum up and down times for each piece of equipment to be operated with appropriate numbers of startups and shutdowns. In the numerical study, the proposed method is applied to the daily operational planning of a gas turbine cogeneration plant for district energy supply. It is clarified how the constraints for minimum up and down times affect the operational strategy and cost. Through the study, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method is ascertained.

But many municipal anaerobic waste treatment systems fail due to the lack of adequate microbial inoculum and also hampered by the doubts on many aspects of its operation and stability. In this regard biomethanation of the organic fraction of urban waste was carried out in laboratory scale reactors with different inoculum. The interdependence among the anaerobic microbial community which leads to stability in operation was assessed with a set of diverse factors. Influential interplay of various physiochemical factors which includes Volatile fatty acid content, reduction in Chemical oxygen demand, average biogas production, methane content of the bio-fuel, variation in pH, influence of temperature and reduction in total solids content was assessed. The operation instability can be solely attributed to three factors, inadequate methanogenic diversity, differential nature of substrate and variation in temperature. Methanogens were isolated from different inoculum based stable digesters and an consortium was developed. The consortium not only circumvented the loopholes of the individual stable digesters but also demonstrated an enhanced stability, greater biogas yield, more methane content and higher reduction in chemical oxygen demand. To confirm the efficacy of the consortium, a direct equal mixture of various inoculum (bypassing the isolation step) was used for biomethanation process. Though it improved the performance of the digesters, the efficiency exhibited by the explicit role of the consortium was higher. Methanogen cell number was estimated both by direct count using fluorescence microscope and by roll tube technique on enriched media. Tracking individual methanogenic species of the consortium in the due course of organic waste digestion will be further carried out using FISH and immune-molecular techniques for further understanding of complex anaerobic process.","Biomethanation; COD; Consortium; Methanogens; Urban waste; VFA","biogas; methane; volatile fatty acid; anaerobic bacterium; anaerobic digestion; article; biofuel production; biomethanation; bioreactor; biotransformation; chemical oxygen demand; methanogenic bacterium; microbial community; microbial consortium; municipal solid waste; nonhuman; organic waste; pH; population distribution; temperature; thermophilic bacterium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881305381

Box 20, 53851 Lappeenranta, Finland","The calcium looping process is a fast-developing post-combustion CO 2 capture technology in which combustion flue gases are treated in two interconnected fluidized beds. CO2 is absorbed from the flue gases with calcium oxide in the carbonator operating at 650 °C. The resulting CaCO3 product is regenerated into CaO and CO2 in the calciner producing a pure stream of CO2. In order to produce a suitable gas stream for CO2 compression, oxy-combustion of a fuel, such as coal, is required to keep the temperature of the calciner within the optimal operation range of 880-920 °C. Studies have shown that the calcium looping process CO2 capture efficiencies are between 70% and 97%. The calciner reactor is a critical component in the calcium looping process. The operation of the calciner determines the purity of gases entering the CO 2 compression. The optimal design of the calciner will lower the expenses of the calcium looping process significantly. Achieving full calcination at the lowest possible temperature reduces the cost of oxygen and fuel consumption. In this work, a 1.7MW pilot plant calciner was studied with two modeling approaches: 3-D calciner model and 1-D process model. The 3-D model solves fundamental balance equations for a fluidized bed reactor operating under steady-state condition by applying the control volume method. In addition to the balance equations, semi-empirical models are used to describe chemical reactions, solid entrainment and heat transfer to reduce computation effort. The input values of the 3-Dmodel were adjusted based on the 1-D-model results, in order to model the behavior of the carbonator reactor realistically. Both models indicated that the calcination is very fast in oxy-fuel conditions when the appropriate temperature conditions are met. The 3-D model was used to study the sulfur capture mechanisms in the oxy-fired calciner. As expected, very high sulfur capture efficiency was achieved. After confirming that the 1-D model with simplified descriptions for the sorbent reactions produces similar results to the more detailed 3-D model, the 1-D model was used to simulate calcium looping process with different recirculation ratios to find an optimal area where the fuel consumption is low and the capture efficiency is sufficiently high. It was confirmed that a large fraction of the solids can be recirculated to both reactors to achieve savings in fuel and oxygen consumption before the capture efficiency is affected in the pilot unit. With low recirculation ratios the temperature difference between the reactors becomes too low for the cyclic carbonation and calcination. As a general observation, the small particle size creates high solid fluxes in the calcium looping process that should be taken into account in the design of the system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Plant species distribution at regional scale is largely controlled by climate. The dominant climatic factors influencing plant species distribution can be obtained by the relationship between climate and plant species distribution. And the dominant climatic factors are very important for revealing the reason of the formation of plant species distribution, determining the appropriate distribution zone of plant species and evaluating the responses of plant species to climate change. Quercus mongolica is the dominant tree of deciduous broad-leaved forest, conifer-broadleaved mixed forest in the temperate region of China. In order to provide the scientific support for Q. mongolica forest management and countermeasures to cope with future climate change in China, we have to make sure what the dominant climatic factors of its distribution are. But studies in this area are so few that restrict the understanding of the response to climate change and Q. mongolica forest scientific operation. Thus, the potential distribution of Q. mongolica in China and its relationship with climatic factors were studied in this paper. Based on the geographical distribution data of Q. mongolica and six climatic variables potentially controlling plant functional types'distribution including annual precipitation (P), annual range of monthly mean temperature (DTY), temperature of the coldest month (Tc), temperature of the warmest month (Tw), accumulated temperature of not less than 5°C(GDD5) and moisture index (MI), and their contribution to geographical distribution of Q. mongolica from the maximum entropy (Maxent) model. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the accuracy of model prediction. The AUC value reached 0. 932, and the high value indicated predictive accuracy of model achieved the ""Excellent""level. Combined with the contribution of each climatic factor as mentioned above, four dominant climatic factors controlling Q. mongolica distribution were determined, including annual precipitation (P), annual range of monthly mean temperature (DTY), temperature of the warmest month (Tw) and accumulated temperature of not less than 5°C(GDD5). Thus, a relationship between the geographical distribution of Q. mongolica and dominant climatic variables was reconstructed. The thresholds of four dominant climatic factors were given by the relationship between the geographical distribution probability of Q. mongolica and dominant climatic factors, i. e. 330mm≤ P≤910mm, DTY≥29°C, 1200°C·d≤GDD5≤3500°C·d, 17°C≤Tw ≤26°C. Then the potential distribution of Q. mongolica in China was given by the ArcGIS spatial analysis technique. The potential distribution area of Q. mongolica included Heilongjiang province, Jilin province, Liaoning province, eastern Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Beijing, Tianjin, north-central of Hebei province, central part of Shandong province, most parts of Shanxi province and northeast of Shaanxi province. The total area covered 1002 points of the 1013 distributed points of the actual distribution of Q. mongolica. The simulation accuracy was more than 98%, indicating that the simulated distribution of Q. mongolica was very coincidence with the actual distribution. The results might provide important basis for making scientific management of Q. mongolica forest and developing the countermeasures to deal with future climatic change.","Dominant climatic factors; Geographical distribution; Maxent model; Quercus mogolica","broad-leaved forest; climate change; coniferous forest; deciduous forest; forest management; geographical distribution; mixed forest; threshold; China; Coniferophyta; Quercus; Quercus mongolica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875513803

The mere fact that Hurricane Sandy occurred late in the 2012 hurricane season but with such a destructive power and took a seemingly unusual path has reignited across the scientific as well as political arena the debate on the climate change/global warming and its possible impact on tropical cyclones. While climate change does not seem to be directly responsible for any single storm, it, however, can make tropical cyclones worse in a warmer climate than they otherwise would have been. Therefore, the anticipated tropical cyclone hazard level in a future projected climate becomes essential in order for governments and citizens around the world to implement adequate policies and disaster prevention plans to make coastal urban communities resilient to tropical cyclones. In this paper, Hurricane Sandy is reviewed in the historical context using US National Hurricane Center best track data. Future changes of tropical cyclone worldwide activity under a warmer climate projected using Atmospheric Global Climate Models (AGCM) are reviewed in terms of tropical cyclone frequency, intensity, and tracks.

The reduced mass and the payload variations, however, may also change the vehicle dynamics significantly. A lightweight vehicle model considering payload mass as well as center of mass location parameter variations is developed. The proposed model is then compared with those with and without payload. In order to analyze the effect of payload changes, the sensitivity of vehicle state parameters is simulated with direct method.

Since the land is the main input factor of the bioenergy production, the development of biofuels will inevitably lead to change of the land use structure and allocation and thereby affect the climate system. With Central Europe as the study area, this study explored the impacts of land use/land cover change (LUCC) on climate under the influence of demand of bioenergy production for land resources. First, the land use structure from 2010 to 2050 is simulated with the Agriculture and Land Use model in MiniCam. The result indicates that the main conversion will be mainly from grassland and forest to cropland and from cropland to grassland. Then the Dynamics of Land System model was used to spatially simulate the LUCC in the future. The impacts of LUCC on the climate were analyzed on the basis of simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The climate change will be characterized by the increase of latent heat flux and temperature and the decrease of precipitation. © 2013 Fang Yin et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888867384

Some of these performances are contradictory with each other which increase the importance of the design and material selection of windows. Natural lighting and thermal performance are examples for the contradictions in window design. Usually when transparency is increased in windows the thermal conductivity of the system is also increasing which decrease the overall thermal performance of the window. Shutters are the components of a window which is mainly used to control the natural lighting through a window system. Another important benefit from the shutters may be its contribution to overall thermal performance of the window systems. As a Mediterranean country several types of traditional window shutters have evolved in Turkey. Istanbul is the historical and economical capital city of Turkey and wooden vertical pivoted shutters are the most common type of shutters in the traditional wooden Istanbul houses. There is also a growing trend in the usage of vertical PU filled aluminium roller shutters in these kinds of houses. Two houses using each other type of shutters are examined in 2012 for determining the most efficient type of shutters in terms of energy usage.

Unusually high local temperatures can occur due to unexpected and localized power dissipation in a particular device, which was not anticipated nor designed in the device. Unintended high temperatures may be the source of circuit damage or it might be caused by the failure itself, such as a tiny short-circuit. However, it is often difficult to obtain enough information about the physical structure and characteristics of the circuit to clearly identify the cause of the failure. The method we present here is an imaging technique with both thermal distribution and emission intensity superimposed on a single image. Thermoreflectance thermal imaging takes advantage of the differences in light reflectivity of the surface with a changing temperature. This relationship is quite linear in a typical temperature range of interest. Using 1300 nm wave length for the illuminating source, the metal circuitry of interest is directly observed through the almost transparent silicon substrate of a flip chip mounted device. With the same photo detecting imaging sensor, i.e. InGaAs junction array, the emission from the target device through the silicon substrate is also detected. If there are some local electron collisions, e.g. due to a current concentration at a defect or a tiny whisker, a localized excess energy by electron-electron collision yields the photon generation and emits an electromagnetic wave. The photons having a sufficient energy level at wavelength transparent to silicon, reach the photo detecting imaging sensor. With software processing and precise synchronization of the driving circuit, illumination, and imaging, we can separate the thermal signal from the emission and observe transient behavior on a nanosecond time scale. The time response is helpful in some cases to separate cause and effect. As an example, an unintended small short-circuit resulting from the fabrication process may be reproduced for a small number of samples. The emission would be observed first, followed by the thermal signal which propagates in time. Another example is for a circuit with low design margin, in this case only a single sample exhibits a difference between emission and/or thermal image while numbers of good samples are identical with respect to the emission and thermal image. This difference clearly indicates the location of a potential failure. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894684447

It is a mandatory element for multi-phase flow calculations and has a significant impact on development schemes, expected hydrocarbon recovery factor and the related revenues. Moreover, it impacts the surface facilities decision based on predicted produced fluids and recycling requirements, which might affect the economics of any related projects. Accordingly, obtaining representative relative permeability profile is a historical continuous challenge in the industry through common laboratory methods of steady state and unsteady state along with other numerical modeling approaches. Experimental relative permeability profiles using both methods of steady state and unsteady state have been obtained for one of the main reservoir rock types (RRT A) from a giant carbonate field in the Middle East. Comprehensive characterization and detailed numerical modeling for mixed wettability carbonates at full reservoir conditions has been studied covering all the details of rock properties, capillary pressure coupled with relative permeability profiles. The analysis revealed the uncertainty associated with each measurement method and surprisingly the limited data range of unsteady state method. Moreover, for the selected reservoir rock types, non-unique relative permeability profiles have been obtained using various experimental approaches and empirical correlations within the numerical modeling process in which different produced relative permeability profiles matched reasonably the laboratory reference measurements. The resultant relative permeability profiles associated with uncertainty range presented in this paper has shown the significant influence of the measurement method selection, which impact the dynamic simulation models predictions and the eventually field development options. This work provides insight on experimental methods selection and optimum conditions to acquire representative relative permeability profiles with emphasis on possible sources of uncertainties and errors. It clearly demonstrates the relative permeability accuracy levels of various numerical modeling processes and the potential of non-unique profiles which dictate the reservoir dynamics, performance as well as economics.

PGMs are often applied for annual simulations to provide both maximum concentrations for assessing compliance with air quality standards and frequency distributions for assessing human exposure. Efficient methods for computing ozone at different emission levels can improve the quality of ozone air quality management efforts. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the decoupled direct method (DDM) to calculate first-and second-order sensitivity of ozone to anthropogenic NOx and VOC emissions in annual PGM simulations at continental scale. Algebraic models are developed that use Taylor series to produce complete annual frequency distributions of hourly ozone at any location and any anthropogenic emission level between zero and 100%, adjusted independently for NOx and VOC. We recommend computing the sensitivity coefficients at the midpoint of the emissions range over which they are intended to be applied, in this case with 50% anthropogenic emissions. The algebraic model predictions can be improved by combining sensitivity coefficients computed at 10 and 50% anthropogenic emissions. Compared to brute force simulations, algebraic model predictions tend to be more accurate in summer than winter, at rural than urban locations, and with 100% than zero anthropogenic emissions. Equations developed to combine sensitivity coefficients computed with 10 and 50% anthropogenic emissions are able to reproduce brute force simulation results with zero and 100% anthropogenic emissions with a mean bias of less than 2 ppb and mean error of less than 3 ppb averaged over 22 US cities. © 2013 Author(s).",,"air quality; anthropogenic source; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; emission; numerical model; ozone; prediction; sensitivity analysis; troposphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884832441

However, the injected CO2 could cause migration of subsurface substances, volatile organic contaminants, for example, which may threat ground water system seriously. Mass transfer of volatile organic contaminants moving into CO2 phase through interfaces is one of fundamental problems of safety assessment and risk analysis in CO2 sequestration. In this paper, we proposed a method to calculate mass transfer coefficients of the volatile contaminant moving into CO2 phase by defining a length of interfacial mass transfer region, LIMTR , on the basis of the interphase mass transfer characteristics of oil volatilization in CO2-brine-oil three phases in porous media. The calculation results were compared with the results obtained by numerical simulations. The calculation results show that the lumped mass transfer coefficient Kg ranges from 10-7 to 10-2 1/s, and the mass transfer coefficient Kna ranges from 10-6 to 10-1 1/s. By using the proposed method, the interphase mass transfer coefficients for the CO2-brine-oil threephase system can be readily obtained without the specific interfacial areas between multiple phases known.","Contaminant migration; Estimation method; Mass transfer coefficient",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898752239

The performance of the proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) for flux measurement is characterized, with additional considerations given to the homogeneity and stationarity assumptions required by EC. Observed mixing ratios and fluxes of OVOCs (specifically methanol, acetaldehyde, and acetone) vary significantly with time of day and wind direction. Higher mixing ratios and fluxes of acetaldehyde and acetone are found in the daytime and from the direction of a forested park, most likely due to light-driven emissions from terrestrial plants. Methanol mixing ratio and flux do not demonstrate consistent diel variability, suggesting sources in addition to plants. We estimate air-sea exchange and photochemical rates of these compounds, which are compared to measured vertical fluxes. For acetaldehyde, the mean (1σ) mixing ratio of 0.13 (0.02) ppb at night may be maintained by oceanic emission, while photochemical destruction outpaces production during the day.

As an alternative energy, natural gas could well be the main energy of the future development. Next twenty years will be the age of rapid natural gas growing. It has been predicted that China will be one of the largest global natural gas consumers. Twenty-five percent of country's total natural gas consumption was imported. However, China is unable to be self-sufficient in natural gas resources in last ten years. So it is necessary to depend on imports to meet the rapid rise in natural gas demand. There are two main channels to import natural gas: pipeline transportation and ship-loading liquefied natural gas. Due to the limitation of pipeline transportation, ship-loading LNG will be China's major import channel in the future. LNG is irreplaceable, wide-used, clean and low-carbon. With continued progress in mining technique and the discoveries of unconventional energy, the available natural gas resources in China will be increasingly rich; this enables sustainable development in energy. The introduction and innovation of liquefaction technique and the localization of LNG technique will improve the embarrassing dependence on imported process technology and supply strong technique support for the development of LNG. Domestic liquefied natural gas plants' out-put is expected to exceed 7.5 million tons per year. As the key measure to reduce PM 2.5 emission, LNG will gradually replace oil as a new-generation car fuel and become the new surpass the old-timer.

In this paper, a variant of Gaussian Process is proposed and applied to make short-term prediction of the overall wind power production in the island of Ireland. Only measurement data of power generation is utilized. A number of modifications are made to the standard Gaussian Process during the model training and testing procedures to reduce the computational complexity of modeling and forecasting wind power generation. The prediction results are compared to those of standard Gaussian Process and persistence model to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Flooded rice fields are a major source of atmospheric CH4, accounting for 5%-19% of total global emissions. Methanotrophs are the only known microorganisms that catalyze the oxidation of CH4 produced in the rice fields and thus play an important role in attenuating the emissions of CH4 into the atmosphere. Atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased drastically and is predicted to double by the end of this century. This dramatic change in atmospheric CO2 may have profound ecological consequence on biogeochemical cycles of key elements such as methane oxidation in rice fields. Free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) is an ideal technique to assess ecosystem responses to the projected atmospheric CO2 elevation by 2100 because it provides undisturbed field conditions and more reliable measurements than closed chambers with elevated CO2. The effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 on microbial methane oxidation has been investigated mostly by traditional techniques such as most probable number (MPN), which may underestimate the changes in methanotrophic changes under elevated CO2. China-FACE was established in 2004 to investigate agricultural ecosystem response to simulated global change of rising atmospheric CO2, and could approach the in situ conditions as much as possible for investigating the microbial mechanisms underlying methane oxidation changes under elevated CO2. The rhizospheric soils at different rice growing seasons were collected to quantify the changes in methanotrophic populations using real-time quantitative PCR of pmoA genes of type Ia, type Ib and total methanotrophs. Pairwise comparison demonstrated positive responses of methanotrophic population size to elevated CO2 at most stages of rice growing seasons. Total methanotrophs abundance were stimulated at the seedling and tillering stages in 2009, and seedling, jointing and grain filling stages in 2010 regardless of the application rates of nitrogenous fertilizer. In 2009, the total methanotrophs abundance was elevated at the ripening stage and declined at the flowering stage under high application rate of nitrogenous fertilizer, while the reverse trend was observed with regard to the low application rate of nitrogenous fertilizer. This implies that the availability of nitrogenous fertilizers might have intensified the response of methanotrophic populations to elevated CO2 in rice field. A significant decline (P&lt;0.1) in total methanotrophic population was observed at the ripening stage in 2010,suggesting that the elevated CO2 inhibits the growth of methanotrophs under certain conditions. The consistent response to elevated CO2 was observed for both type Ia and total methanotrophic population during rice growing seasons except for the tillering stage under low application rate of nitrogenous fertilizer in 2009. Type I b methanotrophic abundance was increased at most rice growing stages except for the grain filling stage under high application rate of nitrogenous fertilizer and the ripening stage under low application rate of nitrogenous fertilizer in 2010. Furthermore, high application rate of nitrogenous fertilizer further stimulated the abundance of type I methanotrophs under elevated CO2. This result implies that intensive fertilization appeared to favor the growth of type I rather than type II methanotrophs under elevated CO2 condition. The results of this study suggested that the rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere may affect the community structure of methanotrophs, which could ultimately alter the biogeochemical methane cycling in rice fields.","Elevated CO2; Methanotrophs; Rhizosphere of rice plant; Rice field","abundance; agricultural ecosystem; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; catalysis; community dynamics; developmental stage; ecosystem response; emission inventory; fertilizer application; global change; growth rate; inhibition; methane; methanotrophy; microbial activity; microbial community; natural attenuation; oxidation; paddy field; polymerase chain reaction; population size; rhizosphere; rice; soil microorganism; China; Methylococcaceae; Methylocystaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876020976

A new prototype of living is eco-communities which consist of a set of buildings and associated devices for energy generation, conversion, consumption, storage and recovery networks trying to be self-sufficient as much as possible. The optimized operation of an eco-community, however, is challenging since multiple energy devices and energy processes are highly coupled; and the time coupling state dynamics in building models interact with each other in a complicated way due to the device coupling. This paper presents the integrated optimization of energy devices, energy processes, renewable energy and waste-to-energy conversion of a small eco-community to reduce daily costs while satisfying time-varying building needs. A mixed-integer optimization model of energy networks is established, and the problem is solved by using branch-and-cut. After linearizing all the nonlinear terms, near-optimal solutions are still difficult to obtain efficiently due to the complicated interactions among constraints. To improve the efficiency, a two-phase approach is developed. Numerical testing shows that the method can efficiently generate high quality operation schedules for the eco-community, and the total energy cost is reduced by this optimized operation, e.g., making efficient use of energy conversion and using the energy resources when they are cheap. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Efficient use of energy; Energy generations; Environmental footprints; Integrated optimization; Mixed integer optimization; Near-optimal solutions; Optimized operations; Regeneration capacity; Cost reduction; Energy conversion; Numerical methods; Optimization; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891518640

It is efficient to inject super critical CO2 into an aquifer if the geomechanical stability of the aquifer-caprock system can be maintained during the injection. An axisymmetric horizontal aquifer-caprock system is modeled including hydromechanical coupling in order to study influence of various factors - such as injection rate, permeability and stiffness of the caprock and aquifer - on the stability and especially the integrity of the caprock. Here the local safety factor is considered as an index of caprock integrity. It is shown that the effective stress state of the caprock close to the injection well could become critical for shear failure quite early in the injection. A buildup of gas pressure in the aquifer causes caprock deformation, inducing an increase in deviatoric stress within the caprock. Larger injection rates and lower aquifer permeability amplify such phenomena, increasing the risk of losing caprock integrity. Increased aquifer stiffness, in contrast, restricts the caprock deformation, and lowers the risk.","Caprock integrity; Coupled hydromechanical modelling",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896509516

CO2 is captured from large emission sources and injected and stored in deep reservoir rocks, including saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas field. Under typical pressure and temperature conditions at deep reservoirs (depths &gt; 800m), CO2 will be stored in supercritical state, subsequently dissolving in groundwater, and eventually forming carbonate minerals through geochemical reactions in a long-term (e.g., thousands of years). To ensure the safety and permanence of the storage, numerical simulation is considered as the most powerful approach for predicting the long-term fate of CO2 in reservoirs. A parallelized general-purpose hydrodynamics code TOUGH2-MP has been used on scalar architectures where it exhibits excellent performance and scalability. However, on the Earth Simulator (ES2), which is a massively parallel vector computer, extensive tune-ups were required for increasing the vector operation ratio.

Human, since time immemorial, have influenced the landscape they live in a variety of ways resulting in varied land use changes. Increase in population leads to the expansion in agriculture land, built-up areas, uncontrolled forest fires, mining of minerals, extraction of timber and permanent plantations, which in turn are responsible for habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity. Garo hills districts of Meghalaya are endowed with rich biodiversity both in terms of flora and fauna. With the increasing of population there is pressure exerted on these natural resources for the livelihood as there is hardly any alternative available. In the meantime small forest based urban centers were developed and with the expansion of these the requirement of the local people also changed. Due to urbanization and population pressure the traditional shifting cultivation (jhum), which is still the only livelihood of many areas of the Garo hills; have been converted into permanent cash crop areas. This conversion has a reverse impact on the environment. In the traditional jhumming method the native forests which were slushed and burned for agriculture purposes could revive in 18 to 20 years' time (Jhum cycle). But due to the introduction of economically sound plantation crops like areca nut, cashew nut and tea the native diversity of the forest area is in the verse of extinction. The present study reveals that rapid population growth is the solely responsible factor for changes the landscape of Garo hills of Meghalaya.","Cash crop; Garo hills; Jhum; Population pressure; Roads diversion; Urbanization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880965141

However, our understanding is limited to the reduction potential of these natural riverine systems. This study utilized the long-term (1978-2004) river discharge and water quality records from an upriver and a downriver location of the Atchafalaya River to quantify the inflow, outflow, and inflow-outflow mass balance of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN = organic nitrogen + ammonia nitrogen), nitrate + nitrite nitrogen (NO3 + NO2), total phosphorous (TP), and total organic carbon (TOC) through the largest river swamp basin in North America. The study found that, over the past 27 years, the Atchafalaya River Basin (ARB) acted as a significant sink for TKN (annual retention: 24%), TP (41%), and TOC (12%), but a source for NO3 + NO2 nitrogen (6%). On an annual basis, ARB retained 48,500 t TKN, 16,900 t TP, and 167,100 t TOC from the river water. The retention rates were closely and positively related to the river discharge with highs during the winter and spring and lows in the late summer. The higher NO3 + NO2 mass outflow occurred throughout spring and summer, indicating an active role of biological processes on nitrogen as water and air temperatures in the basin rise. ©2013 by the authors;.","Eutrophication; Mississippi-atchafalaya river system; Nutrient removal; Riverine carbon; Riverine nutrients; Riverine wetlands","Carbon; Eutrophication; Nitrogen; Nitrogen compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Rivers; Water quality; Watersheds; Wetlands; Biological process; Mississippi-atchafalaya rivers; Nutrient removal; Reduction potential; Riverine wetlands; Total Kjeldahl nitrogens; Total Organic Carbon; Total phosphorous; River pollution; biogeochemical cycle; carbon; eutrophication; mass transfer; nitrogen; nutrient dynamics; phosphorus; retention; river basin; river discharge; river water; seasonal variation; total organic carbon; wetland; Atchafalaya Basin; Louisiana; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883137212

The Calculator, developed by Georgia Tech researchers, is the first load-based life cycle emissions model for transit buses. The modal modeling approach of the Calculator estimates emissions as an indirect function of engine load, which in turn is a function of transit services parameters such as driving cycle (idling and speed-acceleration profile), road grade, and passenger loading. Direct emissions are calculated based on the scaled tractive power (STP) operating mode bins employed in the Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES) model, and life cycle emissions are calculated using the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model. The case study compares life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of five vehicle technologies, conventional compression ignition, parallel hybrid electric, series hybrid electric, battery electric, and fuel-cell electric, in combination with three fuel types, conventional diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), and 20% biodiesel. The comparisons are carried out for two public transit route types, e.g. an urban transit route vs. an express bus route. The Atlanta case study showcases the practice-ready capabilities of the GHG emissions calculator in assessing the differences in technology and fuel performances under different operating conditions. The results illustrate that the decision as to which bus technology-fuel combination produces the least greenhouse gas emissions is a function of location and route characteristics. The Calculator will support transit agencies in evaluating bus technologies for GHG emissions within the context of local conditions. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Compression ignition; Different operating conditions; Life cycle emissions; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Motor vehicle emissions; Regulated emissions; Vehicle technology; Bus transportation; Electric ignition; Fuels; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Mass transportation; Mathematical instruments; Rapid transit; Research; Technology; Urban transportation; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890264417

However, no study has investigated the health effects of air pollution on length of survival among diagnosed respiratory cancer patients. Methods. In this study, we conducted a population-based study to investigate if air pollution exposure has adverse effects on survival time of respiratory cancer cases in Los Angeles (LA), CA and Honolulu, HI. We selected all White respiratory cancer patients in the two study areas from the 1992-2008 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results cancer data. Death from respiratory cancer and length of survival were the main outcomes. Results: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis shows that all respiratory cancer cases exposed to high air pollution referring to the individuals from LA had a significantly shorter survival time than the low pollution exposure group referring to those from Honolulu without adjusting for other covariates (p <0.0001). Moreover, the results from the Cox Proportional-Hazards models suggest that exposure to particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter (PM§ssub§10§ esub§) was associated with an increased risk of cancer death (HR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.44-1.52 per 10 μg/m§ssup§3§esup§ increase in PM§ssub§10§esub§) after adjusting for demographic factors and cancer characteristics. Similar results were observed for particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter and ozone. Conclusion: Our study indicates that air pollution may have deleterious effects on the length of survival among White respiratory cancer patients. This study calls for attention to preventive effort from air pollution for this susceptible population in standard cancer patient care. The findings from this study warrant further investigation. © 2013 Xu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Air pollution; Cancer; Cancer survival; Lung cancer; Respiratory cancer","particulate matter; adverse effects; aged; air pollution; cancer registry; chemically induced; epidemiology; female; human; Kaplan Meier method; lung tumor; male; middle aged; mortality; particulate matter; proportional hazards model; survival; survivor; United States; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollution; Female; Hawaii; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Los Angeles; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Particulate Matter; Proportional Hazards Models; SEER Program; Survival Analysis; Survivors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883615528

Inappropriate and insufficient waste management methods can lead to both health and climate impacts. This paper evaluates five waste management options: hazardous waste landfill, municipal waste landfill, pyrometallurgy, closed-loop recycling, and hydrometallurgy from environmental and economic standpoints. Environmental impacts are analyzed using two life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies: CML2001 and Eco-Indicator 99. Economic feasibilities are analyzed using the technical cost modeling (TCM) method and the cost, revenue, and profits associated with each waste management option are compared. Results show that discarded CRT funnel glass transportation has a significant effect on both the LCA and TCM results. By taking into account the transportation impact, all waste management options result in greenhouse gas emissions and reduced profit. A sensitivity analysis shows that the profit of closed-loop recycling, pyrometallurgy, and hydrometallurgy options all decrease with increases in transportation distance, while the hydrometallurgy option is less sensitive to the distance than the other two options. LCA results show that closed-loop recycling corresponds to the lowest human health and global warming impacts, followed by pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. Landfill options would generate the most environmental impact. Closed-loop recycling, pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy generate more profits (110-450$/ton) than the landfill options (45$/ton). All in all, pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy are the most feasible recycling processes for implementation in the United States. Closed-loop recycling is not feasible because the CRT glass market in the U.S. has become obsolete. Overall, pyrometallurgy appears to be the most environmentally friendly and economical CRT funnel glass waste management option. However, the hydrometallurgy option represents the lowest human health impact due to minimized lead emissions. This option also has greater opportunity for process improvement and is more geographically flexible including the potential to be executed on-site, which allows this novel option the opportunity to become more competitive than the pyrometallurgy option if properly implemented. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Because of its complicated geological condition, reservoir characteristics and obscurity of knowledge of the people, economic evaluation becomes a crucial measurement in order to insure the feasibility of the gas production projects. Take Changshen area of Jilin gas field as an illustration, discounted cash flow (DCF) model was used, net present value, interior rate of return and payout time was selected as economic indicator. The CAPEX and OPEX were assessed based on engineering schedules. The operating conditions and production profile were optimized by using reservoir engineering numerical simulation. Other parameters, such as gas price, tax rate, discount rate etc. were coming from the rules and regulations of the government. The results indicate that the economic benefit of the project is marginal. Project feasibility, as expected, was found to be very sensitive to gas price, gas production, and CAPEX. Project financial analysis indicates a couple of key points which may affect the development of volcanic gas reserve, (1) a significant increase of CAPEX and OPEX was found, which are obviously higher than the ordinary reserve's, (2) CO2 may be used as a byproduct and increase the project's income only it has its commercial purpose, (3) no preferential policy of carbon emission reduction in China, and (4) local gas price is on the low side. Finally, several suggestions are presented in this paper (1) formulate the various terms of the tax credit policy, (2) enact relevant rules and regulations of carbon emissions trade, (3) foster the local industrial gas market to increase the gas price, and (4) increase the financial input into the critical research of the development technique of volcanic gas reserve.

So it s necessary to develop more efficient technologies to reduce CO2 emission. Carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (CCS) is one promising option to reduce CO2. CO2 flooding technique can enhance the oil recovery and achieve the storage of CO2 simultaneously. Therefore it is an important technology to support common development in terms of energy and environment. Under the high pressure, the interfacial tension (IFT) can affect fluid flow during the process of CO2 flooding greatly. Accordingly, there is an important significance to research miscible slug process and improve displacement efficiency. Hence the study of the IFT on supercritical CO 2-water / oil system is indispensable. In order to understand the characteristic of IFT in-depth, this paper summarizes the IFT of CO 2-water / oil system from the aspect of measuring methods, influencing factors and theoretical models. Currently there are less experimental data of IFT under the high pressures because of measuring difficulties in supercritical CO2-water / oil system. As one of the most effective measurement methods, the pendant drop method is developed gradually. This paper introduces the fundamental principles of several methods including selected plane method (SP), drop shape analysis (DSA) and axisymmetric drop shape analysis (ADSA). The relationships between pressure, temperature, concentration of CO2, salinity and IFT are summarized. Generally speaking, the IFT increases with the increasing pressure and salinity, while decreases with the increasing molar fraction of CO2. The effect of temperature on IFT is controversial in different researches. At the same time, this paper also presents the theoretical models of IFT in supercritical CO 2-water / oil system. The work shows clearly the basic principles and applicable scopes of the statistical thermodynamics theories including density gradient theory (DGT) and density function theory (DFT). Finally, the directions should be strengthened concerning the study of IFT as follows: In terms of experiment, it is necessary to find out a method to measure the practical density difference by tracing system; Besides, a more accurate equation of state (EOS) should be constructed to calculate IFT. Therefore the proper measurement method, accurate injection pressure and concentration of CO2, rigorous theory and reliable mathematical model can be considered as research directions in future works.","Carbon capture and sequestration technology; Greenhouse gas; Interfacial tension",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898721200

Post-combustion carbon capture using aqueous MEA solution is the most likely technology to be deployed in coal-fired power plants. Some studies have focused on the dynamic modeling of MEA-based post-combustion carbon capture system recently to facilitate the CCS practice in coal-fired power plants, however a clear strategy is still lacking in how to handle the CO2 capture units in transient mode. In this paper, a dynamic model of MEA-based carbon capture system for coal-fired power plants was built up and validated to study its transient responses. The model was implemented in Invensys Simsci DYNSIM platform, and the stage efficiency was used to correct the assumption of vapor-liquid equilibrium in tower model. The pilot carbon capture facility set up at the University of Texas at Austin was simulated in this research, and the experiment data of case 28 was used for model validation. The local control systems of gas pressure, liquid level and flowrate were designed to keep the system working. The comparison among the pilot test data, simulation of Aspen Plus using ratebased model and simulation of this paper was carried out on the temperature profile inside the absorber and stripper. The results show that the steady state of developed dynamic model fits the measured data fairly well. This dynamic model was then used to study the dynamic character of CO2 capture system under the flowrate disturbances of flue gas and lean solution. The transient responses of CO 2 loading and CO2 capture rate were observed and analyzed, providing basis for further study of disturbance rejection control.","Dynamic model; Mea-based carbon capture; Post-combustion","Carbon capture; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal fueled furnaces; Computer simulation; Dynamic models; Fossil fuel power plants; Mining; Transient analysis; Coal-fired power plant; Local control systems; Post-combustion; Post-combustion carbon captures; Regional distribution; Temperature profiles; University of Texas; Vapor-liquid equilibrium; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899021452

However, a phenomenon is that economic growth is always together with increasing of carbon emissions. In order to control carbon emissions validly in the premise of economic growth and taking into account that there are regional economic growth disparities for most countries, this paper builds a carbon emissions rights optimization model under regional economic growth disparities. This paper proposes two strategies to evaluate economic growth and carbon emissions: one is the same to all regions, and the other one is different. After calculating, finding that the same regulation of emissions reduction for all regions is better for economic growth and different regulation of emissions reduction is better for balanced development of regional economy. It provides certain rating criteria to find equilibrium point of economic development and carbon emissions. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions rights; Economic growth","A-carbon; Carbon emissions; Economic development; Economic growths; Emissions reduction; Environmental problems; Equilibrium point; Optimization models; Regional economic growths; Regional economy; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Regional planning; Economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874610064

Cooperative control of EGR and VGT has tremendous impact on the emission reduction. In order to gain more fine-grained control of intake mass flow rate and intake boost pressure, a new decoupling method based on active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) beyond the traditional feedback control is proposed in this paper. When EGR valve controls the intake mass flow rate, the fluctuation of air mass caused by VGT is regarded as disturbance, estimated and cancelled by ADRC, so does the boost pressure control. Meanwhile, a model based dynamic feed-forward controller is applied to further speed the system up. Simulation results show that the response speed and tracking accuracy of both boost pressure and intake mass flow rate are dramatically enhanced simultaneously in various transient conditions. Furthermore, the proposed method also has remarkable advantages over traditional solution in terms of disturbance rejection performance.","Active Disturbance Rejection Control; Decoupling Control; Diesel Engine; Extended State Observer","Air intakes; Disturbance rejection; Emission control; Exhaust gas recirculation; Mass transfer; Active disturbance rejection; Active disturbance rejection controls; Decoupling controls; Disturbance rejection performance; Exhaust gas recirculation systems; Extended state observer; Model based decoupling; Variable geometry turbocharger; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885925769

In-depth field research was carried out following the 2010 extreme winter known as dzud making use of a combination of participatory research techniques, individual and focus group interviews, and surveys. The harsh winter of 2010 was one of the worst of its kind resulting in the death of eight and a half million livestock. In the last decade, this kind of extreme weather event has been on the rise. Herders have encountered serious difficulties in coping with them, preparing for them and mitigating their impact. Following the transition from a Soviet-dominated regime to democracy and a free market, pastoral livelihoods have become much more exposed to three interrelated forces: climate change and weather dynamics, natural resource degradation, in particular of grasslands and water, and rapid societal change. Co-management of natural resources is a form of collective adaptive management that reduces risks related to climate and societal change. Co-management could benefit from the timely delivery of improved weather forecasting, in particular on a local level. The scaling-out of co-management would benefit from stronger government support in terms of legal protection of new organisational forms, technical and financial support, and improved rural services. The results of this research deepen our understanding of the complexity of the forces that have made herding much riskier. It also opens a window to the benefits of co-management which the government of Mongolia aims to scale out nationally as a means to deal with climate change and related risks. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate risk management; Co-management; Extreme weather; Mongolia; Pastoralism",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071509174

Both regional surveys and locally intensive monitoring of PM, particularly particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5), are now being conducted throughout China. The main research emphases include the spatial distribution, chemical characteristics, and main sources of airborne PM2.5 in many urban areas, as well as industrial sites. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) is one of the highly urbanized and industrialized regions in China. Unfortunately, accompanying the rapid eco-social developments, the PRD has also deteriorated in terms of air, soil and water quality during the last few decades. Air pollution has been a serious environmental problem for many years now and frequent haze episodes in this region were often attributed to high concentrations of airborne PM2.5. Forests play an important role in reducing airborne particulate matter and in maintaining air quality. In order to improve the urban environment and to serve the public health, many urban forests have been constructed to scavenge the huge amounts of dust through the forest canopy. However, the influence of the forest canopy on particulate matter water-soluble ions has seldom been studied to date. In the present study, we regularly monitored concentrations of the total suspended particulates (TSP), PM2.5 and their water-soluble ions (Na+, NH+4, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, SO2- 4, NO-3, NO-2, Cl- and F-) from both inside and outside a suburban forest in Guangzhou, during the rainy season of 2012. The objective of this study was to reveal the importance of tree canopies in scavenging airborne particles and their water-soluble ions. The results showed that the forest canopy significantly reduced the concentrations of PM2.5 and TSP (P&lt;0.05). The concentrations of diurnal PM2.5 and TSP inside the forest were (40.2±10.5) g/ cm3 and (101.3±33.2) g/ cm3 respectively, increasing to (55.8±13.0) g/ cm3 and (116.6±35.4) g/ cm3 outside the forest, respectively. SO2- 4, Na+, NH+4 and NO-3 were the most abundant ions in both TSP and PM2.5, accounting for more than 80% of total ions. The concentrations of SO2- 4, Na+and NO-3 outside the forest were significantly higher than those inside, with the exception of NH+4. Correlation analysis on the ions revealed that during the study period, the principal water-soluble ions existed in the form of NaCl, Na2SO4, NH4HSO4 and NH4NO3. Na+ and Cl- in the water-soluble fraction of PM2.5 and TSP were mainly sourced from sea salt, while the presence of other ions was predominantly influenced by anthropogenic sources. The ratios of c (NO-3) / c(SO2- 4) in TSP and PM2.5, both inside and outside the forest were less than 0.30, indicating that the stationary sources, e. g. coal burning, power plants and other industrial emissions, might be the main contributors to aerosols at the study site. The ratios of c(NO-3) / c(SO2- 4) in TSP were higher than those in PM2.5, implying that the mobile sources contributed more to TSP than to PM2.5. Our results demonstrated that tree canopies could filter PM2.5 and reduce concentrations of all water- soluble ion species, with the exception of NH+4, suggesting that urban forests can improve air quality.","Air pollution; Guangzhou City; Inside and outside forest; PM2.5; TSP; Water-soluble ions","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); diameter; health risk; industrial emission; industrialization; inorganic salt; monitoring; organic acid; particulate matter; public health; sea salt; solubilization; spatial distribution; sulfur dioxide; water quality; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885453325

Reactive Transport Models (RTM) couple geochemical reactions with fluid flow to facilitate both 2D and 3D quantitative, process-based investigations of dolomitization and related carbonate diagenetic reactions. The paper will highlight new results and key conclusions from simulations of dolomitization mechanisms in four different hydro-geological systems: 1) Brine reflux, 2) Mixing zone and sub mixing zone, 3) Geothermal circulation and 4) Fault controlled hydrothermal circulation. Simulations provide new insights on the spatial distribution and dynamic behavior of: •Geometry and distribution of dolomite bodies generated by different styles of subsurface fluid flow and their dynamic interactions; •Regional versus local controls on dolomite occurrence and connectivity; •Sensitivity and hierarchy of geological controlling parameters; •Spatial and temporal relationships between dolomitization and associated diagenetic minerals including anhydrite cements and Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) mineralization; •Effect of hydrothermal fluid induced dolomite recrystallization and anhydrite dissolution; •Criteria to help identify the distribution of reservoir quality including high permeability dolomite ""sweet spots"". When integrated with conventional subsurface data and stratigraphic, geochemical, and structural framework, Reactive Transport Models of dolomitization provide fundamental and robust predictive concepts and reservoir quality models for exploration and new / mature field developments. In particular, the state-of-the-Art simulations allow the analysis and 3D visualization of dolomite body spatial and temporal evolution that can translate into alternative ""process-based"" well correlation methods and strategies for populating diagenetic bodies and their petrophysical properties in geological models for reservoir flow simulations.

Model-based ignition timing strategies require a target combustion phasing for proper calibration, generally defined by the crank angle location where fifty percent of the air/fuel mixture is burned (CA50). When fuel type is altered the target CA50 must be updated in the 'knock region' to avoid engine damage while maintaining the highest possible efficiency. This process is particularly important when switching between gasoline and E85 because they have vastly different octane ratings. A semi-physical virtual octane sensor, based on an Arrhenius function combined with a quasi-dimensional turbulent flame entrainment combustion model, is described that identifies the size of the knock region for a given fuel. The combustion duration model is used to calculate cylinder pressure and temperature which are analyzed with an Arrhenius knock prediction model that accounts for the negative temperature coefficient and air/fuel ratio. An algorithm is developed to identify the ""best achievable"" combustion phasing and update the target desired combustion phasing accordingly. The algorithm operates off-line once the fuel octane number is observed to have changed, and then revised combustion phasing targets are calculated throughout the knock region. Experimental measurements and simulations are used to correlate and validate the algorithm with both gasoline and E85. Results are presented and conclusions are drawn.

Reducing car use and increasing ecofriendly alternative transport, such as public and active transport, are efficient approaches to mitigate harmful environmental impacts caused by a large amount of vehicle use. Besides the environmental benefits of promoting alternative transport, it can also induce other health and economic benefits. At present, a number of studies have been conducted to evaluate cobenefits from greenhouse gas mitigation policies. However, relatively few have focused specifically on the transport sector. A comprehensive understanding of the multiple benefits of alternative transport could assist with policy making in the areas of transport, health, and environment. However, there is no straightforward method which could estimate cobenefits effect at one time.

Methods: Despite the availability of many tools and methods that focus on energy planning from an engineering perspective, only a few approaches have the methodological capabilities to build energy scenarios and quantify their impacts across social and environment indicators in a dynamic and flexible way. To fill this gap, we have created a System Dynamics model customized for the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil to simulate possible trajectories of energy demand and supply. Results: Two scenarios were developed: a business-as-usual case (BAU), with no major changes in the energy profile of the state; the other is an alternative scenario, where the reduction of carbon intensity (RIC) is a key goal. To summarize the results, the scenario RIC has lower greenhouse gas emissions and greater energy generation and employment, but has a total cumulative cost higher than BAU as the final indicators estimated. Conclusions: We can see important opportunities to contribute to global climate change mitigation while fostering a low-carbon energy sector and a green economy in the state. By investing in the renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, technological improvements, and the targets analyzed in this study, Minas Gerais State could reduce political and financial risks originating from the reliance on fossil fuels while generating more income in the energy sector and the state economy as a whole and reducing medium-and longer-term costs. © 2013 Xavier et al.","Energy; Minas gerais; Scenarios","Carbon; Climate change; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; System theory; Energy; Engineering perspective; Global climate changes; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Minas Gerais; Renewable energy source; Scenarios; Technological improvements; Gas emissions; carbon emission; climate change; energy efficiency; energy planning; greenhouse gas; renewable resource; Brazil; Minas Gerais",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893478951

In response to these suggestions, and concerns that existing law and policy will be inadequate to deal with the expected displacement, there recently have been several proposals for new legally binding multilateral instruments specifically addressing climate migration. This Article makes three contributions to the nascent literature on the legal and policy responses to migration induced by climate change. First, it identifies the two principal gaps in existing law and policy that underpin to a significant extent the recent proposals for a new binding multilateral instrument, describing these gaps as the ""rights"" gap and the ""funding"" gap. Second, this Article analyzes three of the leading proposals for a new binding multilateral instrument. It identifies the ways that these proposals would respond to the rights and funding gaps and emphasizes the proposals' limitations Third, this Article emphasizes that addressing climate migration ultimately requires increasing the resilience of communities especially vulnerable to climate change. It then identifies ways to mitigate the effects of the rights and funding gaps by reducing existing vulnerabilities to climate change, without a new binding multilateral instrument. While a series of measures relying largely on existing legal and policy tools may seem less satisfying than proposals for a new binding multilateral instrument, these measures are more likely to address the concerns about human vulnerability to climate change that the proposals for new binding multilateral instruments have admirably highlighted.",,"climate change; environmental legislation; environmental policy; migration; vulnerability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896692904

We overlaid land cover maps from different sources, and the grids with consistent classification were selected as the sample grids. By comparing the results obtained with different decision tree classifiers with the WEKA toolkit for data mining, it was found that the C4.5 algorithm was more suitable for converting land use data of CAS classification to land cover data of IGBP classification.

Many earlier studies have employed data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to measuring total-factor energy efficiency. Despite the development of different DEA models for measuring energy efficiency, the structural inefficiency in energy use, which is referred to as energy congestion in this paper, has rarely been examined. When energy congestion exists, increasing energy input would decrease outputs and therefore lead to a decline in energy efficiency. Eliminating the effect of energy congestion can provide another opportunity for improvement by reorganizing energy input and other inputs at the best proportions. This paper contributes to empirically investigate whether energy congestion exist in Chinese industrial sector. Two approaches respectively based on constant returns to scale (CRS) and variable returns to scale (VRS) are employed in our empirical analysis. It is found that the industrial sectors of most provinces in China suffered from energy congestion to different magnitudes. Our empirical results also show that the magnitude of energy congestion derived from CRS-based model is greater than that from VRS-based model for most provinces.","China; Data envelopment analysis; Energy congestion; Energy efficiency","Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Industry; China; DEA models; Empirical analysis; Energy congestion; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Energy inputs; Industrial sector; Returns to scale; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903592240

However, processes to produce natural gas, shale gas in particular, have also elevated environmental and safety concerns in certain regions of the country. The rapid rise of natural gas is also beginning to drive more thought on longer-term energy policy issues such as the appropriate level of generation diversity (given the history of volatile prices for natural gas), and trajectories of natural gas use that will still allow GHG mitigation sufficient to address the climate challenge.

This partnership was formally announced by the Presidents of the United States and Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada at their meeting in Guadalajara, Mexico, in August 2009. The NACAP effort identified and quantified large stationary sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, identified and screened sedimentary basins suitable for CO2 storage, and estimated the CO2 storage resources of the three most common types of geological media-oil and gas reservoirs, unmineable coal and deep saline formations-in those basins using publicly available geological data. To develop the atlas NACAP had to harmonize storage resource estimation methodologies, define a common scale and resolution, and develop procedures for the treatment of shared sedimentary basins across national borders. Although North America is a large emitter of CO2, the results of the assessments by the three countries demonstrate that potential CO2 storage resources in North America are hundreds, if not thousands, of times greater than current CO2 emissions. Certainly, practical considerations will reduce these estimates. The maps of the large stationary CO2 sources and of the CO2 storage resources show that the sources and storage resources frequently either overlay each other or are within manageable distances of each other, making carbon capture and storage an attractive option to reduce CO2 emissions.","Atlas; Carbon; Coal; Emissions; EOR; Formations; North america; Oil and gas; Resource; Saline; Sequestration",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898746775

In this paper we use new observations of CH 4 and CO in the free troposphere from the Aura Tropospheric Emission Sounder (TES) satellite instrument to place constraints on the role of tropical fire emissions versus microbial production (e.g. in wetlands and livestock) during the (October) 2006 El Niño, a time of significant fire emissions from Indonesia. We first compare the global CH4 distributions from TES using the GEOS-Chem model. We find a mean bias between the observations and model of 26.3 ppb CH4 that is independent of latitude between 50 S and 80 N, consistent with previous validation studies of TES CH4 retrievals using aircraft measurements. The slope of the distribution of CH 4 versus CO as observed by TES and modeled by GEOS-Chem is consistent (within the TES observation error) for air parcels over the Indonesian peat fires, South America, and Africa. The CH4 and CO distributions are correlated between R Combining double low line 0.42 and R Combining double low line 0.46, with these correlations primarily limited by the TES random error. Over Indonesia, the observed slope of 0.13 (ppb ppb-1) ±0.01, as compared to a modeled slope of 0.153 (ppb ppb-1) ±0.005 and an emission ratio used within the GEOS-Chem model of approximately 0.11 (ppb ppb-1), indicates that most of the observed methane enhancement originated from the fire. Slopes of 0.47 (ppb ppb-1) ±0.04 and 0.44 (ppb ppb-1) ±0.03 over South America and Africa show that the methane in the observed air parcels primarily came from microbial-generated emissions. Sensitivity studies using GEOS-Chem show that part of the observed correlation for the Indonesian observations and most of the observed correlations over South America and Africa are a result of transport and mixing of the fire and nearby microbial-generated emissions into the observed air parcels. Differences between observed and modeled CH4 distributions over South America and southern Africa indicate that the magnitude of the methane emissions for this time period are inconsistent with observations even if the relative distribution of fire versus biotic emissions are consistent. This study shows the potential for estimation of CH4 emissions over tropical regions using joint satellite observations of CH 4 and CO. © 2013 Author(s).",,"atmospheric pollution; Aura (satellite); carbon monoxide; El Nino; emission inventory; forest fire; GOES; methane; model test; model validation; observational method; satellite imagery; spatial data; troposphere; Indonesia; South America; Southern Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875879154

DMS has been proposed to regulate climate via changes in cloud properties, though recent studies have shown that present-day global cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations have only a weak dependence on the total emission flux of DMS. Here, we use a global aerosol microphysics model to examine how efficiently CCN are produced when DMS emissions are changed in different marine regions. We find that global CCN production per unit mass of sulphur emitted varies by more than a factor of 20 depending on where the change in oceanic DMS emission flux is applied. The variation in CCN production efficiency depends upon where CCN production processes (DMS oxidation, SO2 oxidation, nucleation and growth) are most efficient and removal processes (deposition) least efficient. The analysis shows that the production of aerosol sulphate through aqueous-phase oxidation of SO2 limits the amount of H2SO4 available for nucleation and condensational growth and therefore suppresses CCN formation, leading to the weak response of CCN to changes in DMS emission. Our results show that past and future changes in the spatial distribution of DMS emissions (through changes in the phytoplankton population or wind speed patterns) could exert a stronger control on climate than net increases in biological productivity. © 2013 Author(s).",,"aerosol composition; cloud condensation nucleus; concentration (composition); dimethylsulfide; emission inventory; marine environment; oxidation; phytoplankton; point source; sensitivity analysis; spatial distribution; sulfate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875887411

The global population increase led to an increasing demand for housing. Natural land has been replaced with artificial surfaces in most cities around the world with undesirable thermal effects. This, together with industrialization growth, has caused a deterioration of the urban environment. Urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon has become a common problem in many major cities worldwide. Several factors influence the urban heat island phenomenon, such as the continuous reduction of green spaces, the changes of wind velocity due to high buildings' density, the anthropogenic heat release and the alteration of surfaces' albedo. The aforementioned factors lead to overheating problems in cities due to the absorption of solar radiation by the various surfaces and buildings. Hence, urban climate is one of the most important elements of urban physical environment, which is often ignored in urban planning. To design a sustainable city, it is necessary to take into account the climatic conditions holistically and strategically during the planning process. Since the 1970s, German researchers have developed the concept of urban climate map (UC-Map) that has a strong focus on applied urban climatology. UC-Map is an appropriate tool for translating climatic phenomena and problems into 2-D images including symbols for land use and spatial information suitable for the urban planner. Therefore this map is a useful tool for urban planners, architects and governors in order for them to understand more accurately and evaluate the effects of urban climatic issues on decision-making and environmental control. At the micro-climate level, several UHI mitigations can be implemented to reduce the UHI severity. First is greenery. The benefits of greenery to the built environment have been widely investigated. Greenery dissipates the incoming solar radiation on the building structures through its effective shading; it reduces longwave radiation exchange between buildings due to the low surface temperatures created by plants' shading; it reduces the ambient air temperature through evapotranspiration. The role of building's materials, mainly determined by their optical and thermal characteristics, is crucial in reducing the thermal and solar hear gains, in the urban environment. The so-called 'cool' materials, characterized by high reflectivity and high emissivity, can improve the thermal conditions in cities by lowering the surface temperatures that affect the thermal exchanges with the surrounding air. Urban ventilation is another important strategy of UHI mitigation. It is important to understand the nature of air flow regimes within urban canyons in order to make further progress in describing the complex interactions between mesoscale forces and the built environment that create the urban boundary layer. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

The benefits of using a load-settlement performance rock socketed pile design method, rather than using ""presumptive"" values, are presented via two case studies in the Sydney region. On one site underlain by medium to high strength shale, dynamic pile load testing was carried out, and on another site underlain by high strength sandstone, Osterberg Cell (O-Cell) testing was carried out to validate the designs. The case studies presented clearly demonstrated that better understanding of load-deformation characteristics of pile foundations will lead to more cost-effective designs. Project owners have a tendency to resist spending money on testing, but the savings that can be achieved by adopting shorter rock socket lengths on medium to large projects far exceed the cost of pile load testing. The adoption of shorter rock socket lengths is generally the objective of project owners and contractors, but at the same time, has the benefit of preserving natural resources and reduction in CO2 emissions.","Bored piles; Dynamic load test; Osterberg cell test; Rock sockets; Sandstone; Serviceability; Shale","Bearing capacity; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Design; Dynamic loads; Dynamics; Geotechnical engineering; Load testing; Pile foundations; Rocks; Sandstone; Shale; Soil mechanics; Structural design; Bored piles; Cost effective design; Foundation design; Osterberg cells; Pile load testing; Rock sockets; Rock-socketed piles; Serviceability; Piles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969999370

This study examined the impact of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on peanut yield for southeastern USA as influenced by soil type and planting date for two spatial levels - region and sub-region. Rainfed yields were simulated for 32 peanut growing counties in this region using the CSM-CROPGRO-Peanut model and the historical weather data of 50. years. The simulations were carried out for several scenarios comprising nine planting dates and seven soil types. Yields were separated by ENSO phase, and tests were performed for each planting date and soil type to examine if pod yields were different across the ENSO phases. Results showed that both planting date and soil type could significantly influence the effect of ENSO on peanut yield. The yield differences among ENSO phases were minimal for the peanuts planted during the middle part of the planting window (May 8 through May 22). The differences, however, were substantial for the planting dates in the initial and terminal parts of the window (April 16 through May 1 and May 29 through June 12). The influence of soil type on the ENSO effect was significant only for soils with the water holding capacity of less than 0.1 and for crops planted during the initial and terminal parts of the planting window. The ENSO effect was weaker and spatially less consistent at sub-regional level, but strong at the regional level. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","CROPGRO-peanut model; ENSO; Peanut yield; Planting date; Soil type","agricultural management; agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; climate change; crop production; crop yield; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; groundnut; rainfed agriculture; soil type; sowing date; spatial analysis; United States; Arachis hypogaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883463283

This phenomenon was observed mostly in urban areas in the Northeast, Midwest, and coastal California. A similar analysis using 2008-2010 O3 data shows that this phenomenon has mostly vanished. From 1997-1999 to 2008-2010, the percentage of U.S. monitoring sites that experienced 95th percentile daily 8-hr maximum average O3 concentration on weekends that were 5% or more higher than on weekdays declined from about 35% to less than 5%. At the same time the percentage of sites that experienced higher weekday concentrations increased from 3% to about 27%. The majority (68%) of the sites, however, exhibited little sensitivity to the weekday/weekend emission changes as they had similar (±5%) O3 on weekdays and weekends. Similar trends were observed for the three other O3 metrics examined: the 95th percentile of the 1-hr maximum and the April-September means of the 1-hr and 8-hr daily maxima. Over this time period, U.S. emissions of O3 precursors declined significantly. However, a greater decline in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions has caused an increase in the volatile organic compounds (VOC)/NOx emission ratios and it appears that this is the reason for the shift away from higher weekend O3 concentrations. In areas where weekend emissions of ozone precursors are lower than on weekdays because of mainly lower motor vehicle emissions, an inadvertent test of ozone control strategies occurs. Such a test provides information on how control strategies that produce emission changes similar to those that occur on weekends affect ozone concentrations. In the late 1990s, lower NOx emissions on weekends resulted in higher levels of ozone in many urban areas. Emission controls that have been enacted since then appear to have eliminated that phenomenon in most urban areas. However, most areas now indicate that weekend emission reductions now have little effect on ozone concentrations at most sites. © 2013 Copyright 2013 A&amp;WMA.",,"Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Volatile organic compounds; Control strategies; Emission reduction; Monitoring sites; Motor vehicle emissions; Ozone concentration; Ozone precursors; Similar analysis; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Ozone; nitric oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollution; article; chemical analysis; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; ozone depletion; priority journal; spatial analysis; United States; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874184699

The first of the three cases included defect islolation with the new methodobgy with FA confirmation using emission techniques. The second sample demonstrated the usage of parts of the flow to confirm the exact location of the emission. The third and final sample uses the flow to find a timing issue in the case where no emission is achieved. The diagnosis time for each of the three devices was within a period of one to three days per device. The confirmation stage of the defect is now the longest lead time of the dianosis process. Product lines are now introducing more and more devices with scan and mixed mode operations. Along with this is having the need for a scan diagnosis environment that is not only contributing, but is also non-intrusive to the FA flow. The importance of having complete failure data from scan testing done on the device rather than just typical pass/fail results from production test provided insight on the defect behavior of the device when analyzed and debugged. The hardware system also played a dual role when it was configured within the chamber of photo emission equipment to stimulate the defect for emission. Localizing failure candidates in real-time with diagnostic software on the front end of the FA flow and then probing for the defect proved to be an efficient manner to which root cause could be found. The correlation of the emission sites with the localized areas in the early procedure gave way for the FIB and TEM efforts, all of which contributed towards establishing the new diagnostic flow.

Ambitions for a more sustainable future in the region are severely compromised by the widespread and rapid take-up of energy-intensive methods for cooling the built environment. For the majority of Asia's countries buildings account for more than 50% of all national greenhouse gas emissions. With around half that energy consumption typically associated with cooling or heating interior spaces, national carbon footprints have increased dramatically in recent decades through the introduction of electronic air-conditioning. This paper argues such trends are unsustainable and low-carbon alternatives for environmental comfort are required urgently. It traces shifts in how air has been 'materially imagined' over the last century or so in Asia and how this bears upon the future of sustainable urbanism. Air-conditioning is seen as pivotal to transformations in urban design and living, such that two phases of modernity are identified: preconditioned and conditioned.

Currently, the terrestrial pool is regarded as a CO2 sink, but scientists are unsure to what extent this trend will continue. Urbanization modifies the existing landscape, and little study has focused on the carbon (C) dynamics of specific urban land uses. In this research, the roadway environment, specifically the grassed right of way (ROW), was studied for carbon sequestration potential, an important ecosystem service. Transportation corridors exist worldwide, and the vegetated filter strip and swale (VFS/VS), two common stormwater control measures (SCMs), often constitute the grassed right of way adjacent to roadways. Carbon pools within roadway VFS/VS soils of North Carolina were specifically examined in this study. This research was conducted in two North Carolina physiographic regions: the Piedmont (characterized by clay-influenced soils) and the Coastal Plain (predominantly sandy soils). Approximately 700 soil samples were collected in VFS/VSs and wetland swales alongside major highways and analyzed for percent total soil C (% total C) and bulk density, which aided in obtaining the C density. Mean soil C densities were 2.55 ± 0.13 kg C m-2 (mean ± standard error, n=160, 0.2 m depth) in the Piedmont and 4.14 ± 0.15 kg C m-2 (n=160, 0.2 m depth) in Coastal Plain highway VFS/VSs. Because grasslands were reported to have similar carbon density values, they could be used as a surrogate land use for roadway VFS/VSs if no specific roadside data were available. Using a 37-year soil chronosequence, the carbon sequestration rate using a simple linear regression within Piedmont VFS/VSs was calculated at 0.053 kg C m-2 yr-1. Utilizing segmented linear regression models, the sequestration rate was calculated to be 0.155 kg C m-2 yr-1 for 15 years and 0.099 kg C m-2 yr-1 for the remaining 21.5 years. The roadside grass sequestration rate assumed by the Federal Highway Administration Carbon Sequestration Pilot Program (0.17 kg C m-2 yr-1) overestimates carbon accumulation by a factor of 3 in the linear model, and by a factor of 1.1 to 1.7 with the segmented linear models. Carbon density did not differ between dry and wetland swales, although % total C was significantly greater in wetland swales. Because C density and % total C in swales were not well defined by age, it appeared more appropriate to assess wetland swales and dry swales using a range of carbon values, rather than a rate of carbon sequestration. The mean VS C density was 3.05 ± 0.13 kg C m-2 (n=40, 0.2 m depth), while that for wetland swales was 5.04 ± 0.73 kg C m-2 (n=44, 0.2 m depth). If promoting C sequestration becomes a factor in ROW management, wetland swales would be more desirable than dry swales.

We find a strong signal for crop yield reductions due to climate change by the 2050s in the absence of CO2 fertilisation effects. However, when these additional processes are included this trend is reversed. The impacts of climate on water resources are more uncertain. Overall, we find reductions in the global population living in water stressed conditions due to the combined effects of climate and CO2. Africa is a key region where projected decreases in runoff and crop productivity from climate change alone are potentially reversed when CO2 fertilisation effects are included, but this is highly uncertain.

This is driven by the hyper-competitive market in most U.S. regions and the desire of providers to meet consumer expectation to be wired into the network at work, in transit or at play - in the city, desert, forest or up in the mountains - at all times and everywhere. The pressure to migrate to solar energy is a result of: • Greening: The desired and sometimes legislated pressure to reduce CO2 emissions. • Reduction of acoustic noise: Improve quality of life or experience at a locale. • OPEX: Reduce operating costs, maintenance and/or total cost of operation. • Other: Solving other logistical or local challenges, such as seasonal fuel delivery limitations. The effective implementation of solar at telecom sites brings new challenges and the need to adapt, including: • Moving from deploying discrete power parts to managing a site's energy, with a common infrastructure model across all loads and services • While the focus typically falls on big-ticket items, many of the problems are the result of small details and supporting subsystems. • Support from all suppliers: The need for all suppliers to support this migration, from the provider of the radio equipment to the generator supplier who may still insist on an AC circuit to support a starter battery recharger. • Landscaping and community acceptance: Working with architects, real estate owners, government services and the local community to stop ""hiding"" the telecom site, but actively displaying and promoting the solution as a part of the human environment. • Security: Off-grid sites have become an attractive target for theft of copper and fuel, and occasionally even solar equipment or power. Security solutions include extensions of what is done today, but there are new answers that could be carried back to normal telecom operations. • Education for planner: Knowledge to make an effective transition to solar includes a stronger understanding of the demand (load and supplementary functions) of the whole infrastructure and what practically can or cannot be done. • Performance management and the boots on the ground: How does the technician know the system is performing well or receive notification the system needs attention? As off-grid sites often require a substantial ""truck-roll"" for support, the path forward is to migrate to proactive planning for service and replacement. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.",,"Acoustic noise; Electric batteries; Operating costs; Radio equipment; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Competitive markets; Consumer expectations; Cost of operations; Government services; Infrastructure modeling; Performance management; Radio base station; Southern California; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925451991

Despite the operational benefits, the addition of a second gas phase in the fractures complicates the quantitative analysis of flowback data. In this work we expand on the model presented by Clarkson and Williams-Kovacs (2013) for the quantitative analysis of two-phase (water+gas) flowback data using analytical history-matching for the estimation of hydraulic fracture properties. Similar to the previous work, our interpretation is that the early flowback data corresponds to wellbore + fracture volume depletion (storage), under the assumption that fracture storage volume is much greater than wellbore storage. In cases where multi-phase matrix flow exists, this flow-regime is followed by multi-phase transient matrix linear flow. From these two flow-regimes bulk permeability (dominated by fracture permeability), effective fracture half-length and other parameters can be estimated. To account for the addition of a nitrogen gas phase we make the assumption of perfect mixing between the hydrocarbon gas phase and nitrogen gas phase where gas composition varies as a function of time. Using this method, nitrogen mole fraction declines from an elevated value and approaches hydrocarbon gas phase nitrogen content (from standard gas analysis) once all injected nitrogen has been depleted (commonly after the flowback period). Further, all wells analyzed previously using the developed methodology have been single-phase dry shale gas wells, where we have assumed that gas is primarily sourced from the adsorbed state during flowback and fracture depletion is immediately followed by single-phase matrix linear flow. In these cases there has also been no condensate production. In the tight gas case presented in this paper, all gas is sourced from free gas and significant condensate production is seen, therefore further changing the dynamics of the problem. For the analysis, we assume that the well is being flowed above the dew point and therefore there is no free condensate flowing in the reservoir. In this example the well has also been shut-in during the flowback period to install production tubing and therefore we will examine the impact of shut-in on effective hydraulic fracture half-length. With this example we show that shutting in the well during flowback decreases the effective half-length and therefore hinders long-term production potential.

Of particular interest to the poultry industry is Salmonella enterica. In the United States, a common practice in broiler management is the reuse of litter for consecutive flocks; this practice can lead to a Salmonella positive flock causing the colonization of sequential flocks. Reuse of litter can also lead to high levels of ammonia volatilization which can impact broiler health and performance. In this paper, two experiments are presented using chemical litter amendments to reduce both ammonia and Salmonella. In the first experiment, liquid sulfuric acid was applied to litter at one of three application rates; 9.07, 18.14 and 27.21 L/92.9 m2. In experiment two, commercially available aluminum sulfate was applied to litter at three different application rates; 22.7, 45.5 and 68.0 kg/92.9 m2. In addition, a cocktail of five poultry associated S. enterica serovars was applied to the litter. Salmonella, ammonia, moisture and pH levels were measured immediately before treatments and every 24 hours up to 96 hours. For treated litter, a reduction was seen in ammonia levels 24 hours after application regardless of application rate, the reduction continued for the duration of the experiment (P&lt;0.001). No Salmonella was detected in litter treated with sulfuric acid. Salmonella was recovered in litter treated with aluminum sulfate.

In this study we examine the contribution of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) towards global tropospheric composition using the global 3-D chemistry transport model TM5 and the recently developed modified CB05 chemical mechanism. By comparing regional BVOC emission estimates we show that biogenic processes act as dominant sources for many regions and exhibit a large variability in the annually and seasonally integrated emission fluxes. By performing sensitivity studies we find that the contribution of BVOC species containing between 1 to 3 carbon atoms has an impact on the resident mixing ratios of tropospheric O3 and CO, accounting for ∼2.5% and ∼10.8% of the simulated global distribution, respectively. This is approximately a third of the cumulative effect introduced by isoprene and the monoterpenes. By examining an ensemble of 3-D global chemistry transport simulations which adopt different global BVOC emission inventories we determine the associated uncertainty introduced towards simulating the composition of the troposphere for the year 2000. By comparing the model ensemble values against a composite of atmospheric measurements we show that the effects on tropospheric O3 are limited to the lower troposphere (with an uncertainty between -2% to 10%), whereas that for tropospheric CO extends up to the upper troposphere (with an uncertainty of between 10 to 45%). Comparing the mixing ratios for low molecular weight alkenes in TM5 against surface measurements taken in Europe implies that the cumulative emission estimates are too low, regardless of the chosen BVOC inventory. This variability in the global distribution of CO due to BVOC emissions introduces an associated uncertainty in the tropospheric CO burden of 11.4%, which impacts strongly on the oxidative capacity of the troposphere, introducing an uncertainty in the atmospheric lifetime of the greenhouse gas CH4 of ∼3.3%. This study thus identifies the necessity of placing further constraints on non-CH4 global biogenic emission estimates in large-scale global atmospheric chemistry models. © Author(s) 2013.",,"air quality; alkene; atmospheric chemistry; biogenic emission; carbon monoxide; climate forcing; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; isoprene; methane; mixing ratio; monoterpene; ozone; trace gas; troposphere; uncertainty analysis; volatile organic compound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875717511

The revision involves extrapolation of the design rainfall statistics, taking into account the current knowledge on future climate change trends till 2100. Uncertainties in these trend projections have been assessed after statistically analysing and downscaling a broad ensemble set of 44 regional and 69 global climate model runs. Climate change scenarios were developed, tailored for the application of urban drainage impact analysis. By means of a further advanced quantile perturbation method, a 100-year 10-min historical rainfall series was perturbed for each climate change scenario. The perturbations were based on the empirical frequency distributions for the lower return periods, and calibrated extreme value distributions for the higher return periods.Based on the climate scenarios and perturbed historical rainfall series, changes in intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) statistics and design storms have been derived. It was shown that the 10-year design storm intensity can increase up to about 50% by the end of this century. Or, systems currently designed for a 20-year return period of flooding, might flood with a mean recurrence interval of - in order of magnitude - 5. years by the end of the century.

Pinnacle Engines' single-cylinder 110cc lean-burn opposed-piston 4-stroke architecture has been tested to gather steady-state fuel consumption, emissions, and combustion stability data over a matrix of speed, load, mixture ratio, and combustion phasing. Contributions to total vehicle fuel usage and emissions production are evaluated using steady-state flow data weighted by time spent at a respective load and speed from a tested WMTC drive cycle. Cumulative emissions and fuel economy impacts are presented for multiple NOx-reducing engine control strategies using control variables of mixture ratio and combustion phasing. Pre-catalyst HC and CO levels are affected by operating strategy and are reported for catalyst load. The extent of combustion instability (COV of IMEP) required to achieve various emissions criteria is swept to evaluate what emissions regulation can be achieved with the current hardware set without NOx after treatment. Results show that operation at best efficiency mixture ratio and combustion phasing is likely sufficient to meet current emissions regulations depending on HC levels. Deviations from best efficiency mapping by a combination of leaner mixture and delayed ignition targeting minimum NOx at 6% COV of IMEP can offer Euro 4 NOx levels without after treatment.

It will explore two case studies carried out at Leeds Metropolitan University by two part-time postgraduate students whilst working full time at their companies. This research is part of the Eco Engineering module taught on the MSc Advanced Engineering Management course. (In both case studies all references to their companies have been deliberately removed).This paper explores how blended learning techniques helped these students and how they achieved a useful analysis and redesign of their companies activities using the PAS2050 GHG reduction techniques and student software. In the case of part time students, the ability to have online resources and tools available is essential in their need for flexible learning, as work commitments may mean they cannot always attend. The drive to increase the number of Food Engineers in the UK is essential to feeding the nation. For example, the National Skills Academy, research has shown that one of the main inhibitors to improvement in productivity is the lack of qualified engineering's that are industry specifically train. They go on to highlight the growth of automation within the food and drink industry, noting that 67% of companies who supply the large food and drink industry, plan to expand their use of technology over the next two years. Moseley J, 2012, FDF President notes that 20% of those employed in food manufacture are to degree level. Currently UCAS, 2012 shows 132 UK courses which are food related from nutrition, health, food science/technology, with just two courses for food manufacture.

Pikas are declining within a large portion of their range, but previous studies have focused only on local pika extinction as a metric of change. We designed a procedure which can provide an earlier warning signal, based on non-invasive sampling and analysis of physiological stress in living pikas. Pikas were sampled at several locations in the Rocky Mountains for the measurement of glucocorticoid metabolites (GCMs) in faeces. Using a time series of faecal pellets from 12 individuals, we detected a significant increase in faecal GCM level in response to capture, thus biologically validating the use of a corticosterone enzyme immunoassay. We also established baseline, peak, and post-peak GCM concentrations for pikas in the Rocky Mountains, which varied according to gender and individual. This is the first study to measure stress hormone metabolites in any species of pika. The methods developed and validated in this study can be used to add non-invasive measurements of physiological stress to pika monitoring programmes and other research designed to assess pika vulnerability to predicted changes in climate. Pika monitoring programmes currently in place use a protocol that relates current site use by pikas with data on local habitat characteristics, such as elevation, to infer potential effects of climate change. Data generated by these monitoring studies can be used to identify the trends in site use by pikas in relationship to habitat covariates. However, this approach does not take into account the role of behavioural thermoregulation and the pika's use of microhabitats to ameliorate variations in climate. Incorporating a stress metric, such as GCM concentration, will provide relatively direct evidence for or against the hypothesis that pikas can be stressed by climate regardless of behavioural adaptations. © The Author 2013.","Climate change; Field endocrinology; Sentinel alpine species; Stress",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983507393

Large-scale integrated projects (LSIPs) face different challenges than do smaller pilot and demonstration projects that have contributed much toward technical research. LSIPs have a much larger spatial scale of operation and a much larger temporal scale as they are expected to be operational for many decades and will require on-going monitoring, performance assessments, and must satisfy regulated reporting requirements. Among the most significant factors required to move an LSIP forward is the need to provide confidence internally to the project proponents that the technical appraisal of the project and the prospective business case can justify a final investment decision (FID) of tens to hundreds of millions of dollars or more. Many non-geological factors also have major influence over CCS project success such as regulatory environment continued uncertainty around national and international policy development around greenhouse gas mitigation, and uncertain public support. Considering the large commitment in financial and technical resources required to reach FID, perhaps neither the slow progress in LSIP development nor the highly visible project cancellations and postponements in this nascent industry should be unexpected. Although all project proponents are confronted with unique geological and non-technical issues there are common aspects that may be recognized within projects achieving FID that may be broadly instructive. Storage exploration and site appraisal is a lengthy process that will take years and should not be underestimated. Industrial scale CCS requires a firm and large commitment and investment in human, technical, and financial resources. Recent LSIPs that have achieved FID have employed dedicated full-time subsurface teams for years to reduce uncertainties in the storage plan. Multi-faceted projects such as large-scale CCS require decisions be made even though uncertainties exist at various stages of project lifecycle. There is a critical need to manage these uncertainties in all aspects of the project, particularly when dealing with changes in project scope or framework in order to reach milestones and decision gates. Projects may not always proceed linearly through lifecycles and may need to recycle back to an earlier development phase if appropriate. Interface management around project integration is a critical process that must be actively managed to consider exploration and appraisal requirements. For example, capture requirements feed into storage requirements, and storage limitations may impact capture considerations and project feasibility. Focused stakeholder engagement is required: projects must provide transparency to the community and the regulator; public reviews and technical due diligence exercises such as independent peer reviews bring confidence to the government; environmental assessments bring confidence to the community all of the above build confidence in the project.","Lessons; LSIP; Project status",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898769137

Engine boosting is required to increase specific power density in order to retain acceptable vehicle performance. Single stage boosting has been sufficient for previous requirements, but as customers and governments mandate lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions, two-stage boosting will be required for downsized and downsped engines in order to maintain performance feel for common class B, C, and D vehicles. A 1.6L-I4 diesel engine model was created, and three different two stage boosting systems were explored through engine and vehicle level simulation to reflect the industry's current view of the limit of downsizing without degrading combustion efficiency with cylinder volumes below 400 cm 3. Some current engines are already at this size, so downspeeding will become much more important for reducing fuel consumption in the future. Twin-turbocharger, supercharger-turbocharger, and turbocharger-supercharger boosting systems were explored using GT-Power and GT-Drive simulation to demonstrate each boosting system's impact on BSFC and drive cycle fuel economy over the NEDC and ARTEMIS (urban) cycle. Transmission shift points were altered to downspeed each configuration to match equivalent vehicle performance while maintaining the same transmission and final drive ratios to not impact vehicle creep speed and gradeability. The twin sequential turbocharged engine had slightly lower full load BSFC values than the supercharged engines, but this slight penalty was easily overcome through vehicle downspeeding by matching performance of the twin turbo vehicle. Vehicle fuel consumption for the supercharger based boosting systems was 8-10% lower over the NEDC and 12-14% lower over the ARTEMIS (urban) cycle when compared to a twin sequential turbocharger boosting system.

Modelled average PM2.5 concentration is higher for Poland than the UK and amounts to 9.2 μg m-3 and 5.6 μg m-3, respectively. The highest concentrations concern London and coastal areas for the UK and urban agglomerations in the case of Poland. Maximum values occurring close to the UK coastline can reach 18 μg m-3 and are related to high levels of sea salt aerosol (SSA). The average contribution of natural particles amounts to 34% and 20% of total PM2.5 concentration, respectively for the UK and Poland. Among anthropogenic particles for both countries the highest contribution falls on secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) and the lowest contribution is for secondary organic aerosols (SOA). In the case of natural particles there is a higher difference in compounds contribution between the UK and Poland. For the UK, primary particulate matter dominates in natural PM2.5 concentration (63%). SSA contributes 84% of natural PM2.5 for the UK and only 3% in Poland. In total (anthropogenic+natural) concentration of PM2.5 dominates SIA (about 50%) for both countries.","Concentrations; Pm2.5; Poland; United Kingdom","Aerosols; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Concentration (process); Anthropogenic emissions; Emission trading scheme; Pm2.5; Point source emissions; Poland; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Secondary organic aerosols; United kingdom; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84935448859

In short, the concept is focused on the intersection of architecture and technology. Furthermore, it describes the holistic point of view which is necessary to further develop a passive house into an active house. Additionally, it is essential to put the terms 'identification', 'ambiance' and 'convenience' into relation with the three-pillar-structure. The goal of this approach would be a self-sustaining home. This autonomy can be observed from the technical side in the electrical standard, green heating systems and water supply and from the architectural side in the inclusive design and sustainable construction method. On the one hand, the abstract highlights the technical aspects and talks about the possibilities of making a building self-sustaining by putting not just PV on the roof, but also by saving its energy in large batteries or using geothermal energy and infrared panels for the heating or small, local wastewater treatment plants. On the other hand, it shows the importance of the architectural design which is able to make a building cheaper in the technical configuration and to convert it into a functional green building. Hence, it is all about smart-design related to intelligent building technologies to reduce the CO2 emissions and to handle our ecological resources with care. The talk is primarily about the integration of these technologies into architectural design - not about the collision or the dualism of these. Eventually, it is not exclusively about zero-emission and lots of insulation. The focus is on the interaction of smart design, using renewable energy resources and low life cycle costs to create and use buildings not just in a green but in a blue way. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Building technologies; Ecological resources; Electrical standards; Low life cycle costs; Residential building; Sustainable construction; Technical aspects; Wastewater treatment plants; Air pollution; Architectural design; Ecology; Geothermal energy; Heating; Intelligent buildings; Manufacture; Renewable energy resources; Water supply; Technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880096519

Societal fatality risk includes the risk to both the occupants of the case vehicle as well as any crash partner or pedestrians. The current analysis is the most thorough investigation of this issue to date. This paper replicates the Kahane analysis and extends it by testing the sensitivity of his results to changes in the definition of risk, and the data and control variables used in the regression models. An assessment by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) indicates that the estimated effect of mass reduction on risk is smaller than in Kahane's previous studies, and is statistically non-significant for all but the lightest cars (Wenzel, 2012a). The estimated effects of a reduction in mass or footprint (i.e. wheelbase times track width) are small relative to other vehicle, driver, and crash variables used in the regression models. The recent historical correlation between mass and footprint is not so large to prohibit including both variables in the same regression model; excluding footprint from the model, i.e. allowing footprint to decrease with mass, increases the estimated detrimental effect of mass reduction on risk in cars and crossover utility vehicles (CUVs)/minivans, but has virtually no effect on light trucks. Analysis by footprint deciles indicates that risk does not consistently increase with reduced mass for vehicles of similar footprint. Finally, the estimated effects of mass and footprint reduction are sensitive to the measure of exposure used (fatalities per induced exposure crash, rather than per VMT), as well as other changes in the data or control variables used. It appears that the safety penalty from lower mass can be mitigated with careful vehicle design, and that manufacturers can reduce mass as a strategy to increase their vehicles' fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions without necessarily compromising societal safety. © Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Fatality risk; Logistic regression; Vehicle footprint; Vehicle mass","Induced exposure; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Light duty vehicles; Logistic regression analysis; Logistic regressions; National highway traffic safety administrations; Regression model; Vehicle mass; Automobile manufacture; Fuel economy; Greenhouse gases; Logistics; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Utility trucks; Vehicles; Accidents; article; car; car driving; equipment design; Fatality risk; female; human; logistic regression analysis; male; methodology; middle aged; mortality; motor vehicle; standard; statistical model; statistics; traffic accident; travel; United States; Vehicle footprint; Vehicle mass; Fatality risk; Logistic regression; Vehicle footprint; Vehicle mass; Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Automobiles; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Vehicles; Travel; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880149994

The effects three recent trends in vehicle designs and technologies have on societal fatality risk per VMT are estimated, and whether these changes might affect the relationship between vehicle mass and fatality risk in the future. Side airbags are found to reduce fatality risk in cars, but not necessarily light trucks or CUVs/minivans, struck in the side by another light-duty vehicle; reducing the number of fatalities in cars struck in the side is predicted to reduce the estimated detrimental effect of footprint reduction, but increase the detrimental effect of mass reduction, in cars on societal fatality risk. Better alignment of light truck bumpers with those of other vehicles appears to result in a statistically significant reduction in risk imposed on car occupants; however, reducing this type of fatality will likely have little impact on the estimated effect of mass or footprint reduction on risk. Finally, shifting light truck drivers into safer, car-based vehicles, such as sedans, CUVs, and minivans, would result in larger reductions in societal fatalities than expected from even substantial reductions in the masses of light trucks. A strategy of shifting drivers from truck-based to car-based vehicles would reduce fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, while improving societal safety. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

If wellbores that penetrate a sealing caprock have permeable fractures in or along a cemented annulus, the fractures provide a potentially fast path for leakage. Because the leaking fluids are reactive toward cement, understanding how reaction, transport, and flow are coupled along a cement fracture is critical to predicting leakage evolution over time. Core flow experiments conducted in our laboratory show channelized flow of acidic brine in fractured cement cores. By staining the initial flow path of an unreactive fluid along the core and comparing it with the final flow path after the acid is introduced we can show that reactive flow is localized to a fraction (16-40%) of the original flow path. This provides experimental evidence that reactive feedbacks can significantly alter the flow along the fracture and needs to be better understood to ensure safety of long-term geological CO2 storage.","Fracture flow; Leakage; Reactive transport",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898736585

Responses indicate widespread acceptance of climate change, moderate levels of risk perception, and limited support for immediate action. Half of the respondents (50%) preferred ?more research? over ?immediate action? (38%) and ?no action? (12%) as a response to climate change. The probability of preferring immediate action is close to zero for those who strongly or somewhat disbelieve in climate change, but as belief in climate change grows from moderate to strong, the probability of preferring immediate action increases substantially; the strongest believers have a predicted probability of preferring immediate action of 71%. These findings suggest that, instead of simply engaging skeptics, increasing public support for immediate action might entail motivating those with moderate beliefs in climate change to hold their views with greater conviction. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Climate change; Immediate action; Public perception; Regional studies","climate change; perception; preference behavior; probability; risk perception; Indiana; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894045407

These platforms are now close to the limit of helicopter range, introducing greater safety concerns and limiting the cargo weights that can be carried, while conventional Offshore Support Vessels travel slowly and would take several days to reach the platforms. Higher power requirements for anchor handling duties means more vessels and more cost, or larger vessels and lower manoeuvrability, leading to longer installation times. In addition proposed maritime legislation will reduce permitted NOx emissions to levels where post-combustion clean-up will be required on diesel engines, adding cost and requiring valuable space. This paper examines potential solutions to these challenges using a novel design of all-electric ships using LNG as the fuel and the advantages offered over conventional solutions. The concept Fast Sea Shuttle (FSS) is a high speed multi-purpose 95m vessel capable of operating at transit speeds of up to 40 knots while still carrying considerable cargo loads and enabling rapid personnel transport in relative comfort and safety compared to current methods, and can contribute to the reduction in overall costs of personnel transportation and logistics. The concept 100m AHTS design offers a bollard pull of 380 tonnes while remaining a compact, manoeuvrable vessel. Both vessels are expected to be able to operate in sea states of 4-5m thereby reducing waiting time for the weather and providing improved safety for the vessel and its crew. In addition to novel design features, the key to the high speed of the FSS, and the high bollard pull and fast response time of the AHTS, is the use of an al-electric propulsion system, combining reciprocating engine and gas turbine generator sets for fuel efficiency, using clean-burning LNG as the main fuel. This concept, making use of the high power density and fast loading times f the gas turbines, provides the most efficient solution with reduced weight to maximise speed, towing power, load carrying capability and passenger comfort, while minimizing the environmental impact of logistical operations by using 'clean' natural gas.

The drying process consumes a significant amount of energy that could be reduced by producing other valuable materials or energy carriers from these by-products. Besides resulting higher overall conversion rates and improved process efficiencies, by-products, which can be extracted or are automatically created during the various conversion steps, should be used to reduce environmental impacts as well. In this analysis, advanced pathways for the recovery and use of by-products from bio-chemical ethanol production like gluten separation from wheat starch, biogas production from stillage or vinasse and combustion of bran for electricity generation are analyzed with regard to their contribution to the greenhouse effect. Therefore, different methodological approaches are applied and compared. The analysis shows among others that ethanol from sugar beet generates less greenhouse gases (GHGs) compared to the ethanol production from wheat. The biogas production from residues and especially the use of bran for heat and electricity generation shows significant GHG reduction compared to the state of the art application. However, the methodological approach for the treatment of by-products highly influences the results.

Often, the focus is on hydrocarbon resources but in times of discussions about climate change and environmental aspects, additional green energy resources are requested. This study explores Paleozoic formations in the north western Alberta Basin with regard to their usability as geothermal reservoirs. A 3D geological model is developed based on 177 km of 2D seismic data and stratigraphic picks of about 1000 wells from the Alberta general well data file. Seven siliciclastic and carbonate units form the major Paleozoic aquifer systems. Porosity and permeability of these Paleozoic formations is derived from data from about 10, 000 core analyses and mapped with geostatistical methods. Formation temperature of Paleozoic strata is estimated by a newly calculated geothermal gradient and the reservoir depth range derived from the 3D model. The siliciclastic Granite Wash unit is presumable the most potential horizon suitable for geothermal development. Its temperature is above 70 °C, effective porosity is estimated with 10 % to 15 %. A possible application for the production of geothermal heat is the provision of warm water for in-situ oil sands extraction in this region reducing climate gas emissions.

There is, however, a large uncertainty regarding certain aspects that affect the future role of this gas distribution grid, such as the eventual share of biomethane in the gas mix, whether power-to-gas will take-off and the expected lifetime of the grid. Hence, it is currently unclear what investments need to be made for the gas distribution infrastructure in order to cope with future changes. To find out how the future may unfold for the Dutch gas distribution infrastructure in 2050, four scenarios have been developed. Two key forces - a key force is a factor that has a large impact on the gas distribution grid but great uncertainty exists regarding its outcome - were chosen, namely ""perceived energy resource scarcity"" and ""willingness and ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions"". Each scenario sketches the future Dutch gas infrastructure by defining, among others, the extent to which biomass will be used to produce biomethane, whether fossil fuel is allowed to be burned locally, and what types of gas will flow through the gas grid. With these scenarios at our disposal, in the next research step, we will establish the impact of the scenarios on the gas distribution grid - i.e. what the layout will be and the corresponding costs - and the accompanying biomethane infrastructure. For this, 3 typical locations were chosen: a rural region, an urban region, and an intermediate region. Through a multi-objective optimization - with maximizing net present value, maximizing biomethane production, and maximizing CO2 emission reduction as objectives - the possible layout of the gas distribution grid and the biomethane infrastructure will be determined for each region. The study's aim is to find similarities in investments among the different layouts, to come to robust investments for the gas distribution infrastructure.","Biomethane supply chain; Gas distribution grid; Multi-objective optimization; Scenario development","Costs; Emission control; Energy resources; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Multiobjective optimization; Supply chains; Biomethane; CO2 emission reduction; Expected lifetime; Gas distribution; Net present value; Resource scarcity; Scenario development; Scenario studies; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903650144

We heterologously expressed and purified three recombinant SHMTs from A. thaliana (AtSHMTs) putatively localized in mitochondria (two) and the cytosol (one).

One of the key elements of the Smart Grid will be the introduction of Microgrids. Microgrids can manage factors such as power quality, efficiency and reliability much more readily by using localized power load profiles and generating capability data. As the current power grid is expected to compose of a larger percentage of distributed generation (DG), including renewables, the Microgrid Control Structure (MCS) must be able to support the power flow from these DGs. Current microgrid models lack a decentralized method of control and management, which limits the microgrids efficacy to artificial or well-conceived microgrids. By utilizing a decentralized control structure based on employing Smart Metering Infrastructure (SMI), the microgrid is shown to be actively able to distribute power more efficiently and reduce peak consumption, thereby reducing the need for larger amounts of spinning reserve produced by carbon intensive power plants. © 2013 IEEE.","control structure; distributed generation; microgrid; scalability","Control and management; Control structure; Current power; Efficiency and reliability; Micro grid; Microgrid control; Smart metering; Spinning reserves; Distributed power generation; Electric load forecasting; Scalability; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883665014

Low noise road pavement is a common noise abatement measure which can locally reduce noise emission levels with approximately 3 dB at municipal roads. Additional costs, compared with normal asphalt types, weigh well up regarding the health benefits. Although abundant studies are available on the acoustic and physical characteristics of low noise pavement, very limited research has addressed the effects on perception of well-being, acoustic and/or environmental quality. In order to examine health and other benefits of this and other road traffic noise abatement measure, Rotterdam recently initiated two studies. In 2013 and 2014 the effects of low noise road pavement on the perception of well-being, health and soundscape will be evaluated at citizens' home environment and when visiting a relatively quiet area (cf. END). Although both studies are set up within different frameworks (ROAM resp. LIFE+ QUADMAP project) methodologies and approaches are aligned where feasible and possible. In short, noise calculations, in situ noise measurements and field surveys will be carried out, both before and after low noise pavement has been applied.","Annoyance; Health; Intervention; Noise; Perception; Well-being","Acoustic variables control; Health; Noise pollution; Pavements; Sensory perception; Acoustic environment; Annoyance; Environmental quality; Intervention; Low noise pavements; Noise; Physical characteristics; Well-being; Acoustic noise",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904509628

While in most cities in the US the population density is very low with an interval of 20 to 50 inhabitants per hectare, in cities like Hong Kong more than 250 inhabitants live on an area of one hectare. As a consequence transportation needs are different, for example gasoline driven cars as preferred transportation systems for US citizens, giving rise to an average consumption of 2000 liters per year for every inhabitant; in comparison to Hong Kong, where average consumption is only 300 Liters per year. So there is a great challenge to reduce these emissions. Apparently solutions are not planned in relation to studies by the International Energy Agency that places the United States as biggest crude oil producer in the year 2017, due the increments of tight oil exploitation. In the shown scenery electro mobility can be a solution for sustainable transportation, when it is combined with PV systems. This study starts with the feasibility of such a combination, and shows the coverage of population where this system can be implemented. From the analysis of economy results: It can be observed that the return of investment of a PV-system can be reduced when it is combined with electric mobility. Today cars driven by an electronic motor with cost of 0.035±0.015 USD/km afforded for transportation energy are more efficient than gasoline motors (based on fuel costs of 0.5±0.1 USD/km for economic cars with a coverage of 14 km/L).So it́s demonstrated that the return of investment is minor than 5 years for the PV system. It́s worth mentioning that charging batteries of electric cars could help to smooth energy peaks in the grid caused by renewables like sun and wind energy (a challenge for further grid systems). Besides the economic study the ecological impact has to be evaluated. . KEYWORDS Photovoltaic systems, Electromobility; urban transportation.

Of particular importance is the reduction of fuel consumption attributed to the vehicle's air conditioning system. The innovative development of a condenser with a 3-pass subcooling zone renders it possible to significantly increase the efficiency of the cooling circuit. This is applicable both in the case of current and future refrigerants. The basis for increasing the efficiency of the condenser is rooted in the systematic analysis of the local heat transfer functions, pressure drops and implementation of an improved flow path configuration. The current condenser design, which includes the functionality of a receiver/dryer with a dedicated subcooling zone, is effective at providing stable liquid refrigerant to the TXV under a variety of conditions. By optimally adapting the flow cross-section to the density change of the refrigerant and increasing the subcooling function by means of a 3-pass flow subcooling zone, it is possible to achieve a significantly lower outlet temperature of the refrigerant. The locally higher pressure drop in the subcooling zone does not have a negative impact on the vapor compression circuit and can therefore be used to increase efficiency without the risk of losses. The theoretical derivation, as well as simulation and measurement results for the new condenser, are presented and discussed in comparison with conventional designs. A new condenser specification has been derived and validated for the system-oriented evaluation of the component. Finally, the validation results from the circuit and vehicle measurements in the wind tunnel are presented. The newly developed condenser resulted in a significant increase of 4% of evaporator performance while maintaining mass and package space. Alternatively, weight and conduction depth can be reduced by 25% while maintaining capacity and system efficiency. 2013 SAE International.",,"Air conditioning; Cooling; Drops; Pressure drop; Refrigerants; Vehicles; Wind tunnels; Conventional design; Local heat transfer; Outlet temperature; Simulations and measurements; System efficiency; Systematic analysis; Theoretical derivations; Validation results; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878779577

Following the publication of both inventories, Port Metro Vancouver, the Port of Seattle, and the Port of Tacoma (""the Ports""), along with affiliated regulatory agencies, used these inventories to produce the Northwest Ports Clean Air Strategy (""the Strategy"") to manage and reduce port-related air emissions, mainly from diesel fuel combustion. Voluntary emission reduction initiatives and potential actions are defined in the Strategy for six sectors [rail, trucks, ocean-going vessels (OGV), cargo-handling equipment (CHE), harbor craft, and port administration]. Air emission reduction goals were set with near-term and long-term milestone years of 2010 and 2015, respectively. While the strategy outlines shared performance measures, each port is implementing emission reduction programs appropriate to its operations. In 2012, updated inventories were published which illustrate the successful results of emission reduction efforts.

The programme and policy side of DSM has been little explored and the research contributes to filling this gap by undertaking a global systematic review of electricity-focussed DSM programme case studies to determine what constitutes best practice programmes and policies in DSM. Systematic Reviews are a method primarily used in the medical sciences and to which have had limited application in the energy policy field to date. DSM 'best practice' is defined as programmes and policies that reduce overall electricity demand or shift loads to off-peak time periods, through measures that are environmentally, economically and socially beneficial, and are transferable between regions and countries. Best practices are not static but constantly evolving as circumstances change and new evidence is brought to light. The UK is currently consulting on how to include the demandside in its Electricity Market Reform policy proposals and a key outcome of this research is to determine the transferability of international best practices to the UK to feed into this process. The research aims to determine how and why particular DSM programmes are successful or fail and what the underlying contextual factors are that could prevent or allow their transferability to the UK.

Such pipelines are considered to be the most likely method for the transportation of captured CO2. The research presented here describes further developments of a state-of-the-art multi-phase heterogeneous discharge and dispersion model capable of predicting fluid dynamic and phase phenomena in releases from high pressure pipelines of CO2 into air. Model validation is included against a number of field-scale experiments considering various vertical releases of CO2 into free air. The model is also used to simulate a puncture release in a buried pipeline and the results near the crater edge are compared to field-scale experimental data. Model predictions are found to describe the experimental observations very well, with a high level of agreement between the two. The study demonstrates the advantages of using a model for addressing accidental releases of CO2 that includes shock-capturing methods and complete three-phase formulations.

The diversity of approaches used by the models is summarized through a series of conceptual figures, and is used to evaluate the wide range of wetland extent and CH4 fluxes predicted by the models in the equilibrium run. We discuss relationships among the various approaches and patterns in consistencies of these model predictions. Within this group of models, there are three broad classes of methods used to estimate wetland extent: prescribed based on wetland distribution maps, prognostic relationships between hydrological states based on satellite observations, and explicit hydrological mass balances. A larger variety of approaches was used to estimate the net CH4 fluxes from wetland systems. Even though modelling of wetland extent and CH4 emissions has progressed significantly over recent decades, large uncertainties still exist when estimating CH4 emissions: there is little consensus on model structure or complexity due to knowledge gaps, different aims of the models, and the range of temporal and spatial resolutions of the models. © Author(s) 2013.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84970046693

This growth, however, has become a concern due to its possible impacts on water quality, health of aquatic biota, and on the environment as a whole. A forensic chemical fingerprinting methodology using GC-MS and GCFID has been developed to characterize and differentiate pyrogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons from petrogenic hydrocarbons in oil sands environmental samples. The characterized target hydrocarbons include hydrocarbon groups (such as total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), n-alkanes, alkylated polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) homologous series and other EPA priority unsubstituted PAHs, biomarker tri- to penta-cyclic terpanes and steranes, bicyclic sesquiterpanes, and diamondoids). For the past 3 years hundreds of samples including various water (such as snow melt water, river water, ground water, and tailings pond water) and sediment (such as river and tailings pond sediments) and various bitumens collected from the oil sands impacted region, have been analyzed. It was found that hydrocarbons in Athabasca River sediments and waters were most likely from four sources: (1) Heavy oil sands bitumen hydrocarbons; (2) Biogenic compounds (the non-toxic naturally occurring biogenic organic compounds produced by organisms or generated from the decay of organisms and plans): n-alkanes with a predominance of odd carbon numbers over even carbon number n-alkanes in C21-C35 range indicate input from natural organic matters to the samples; (3) Hydrocarbons of other lighter fuel oils: such as abundant n-alkanes in the diesel carbon range: n-C9 to n-C22 and 2-ring Cn-Naphthalenes from diluents used for diluting heavy bitumen oil; (4) Pyrogenic PAHs (generated from combustion processes, including vehicular emissions, power plants, and forest fire residues). PAH distribution patterns and higher Pyrogenic Index (PI) values found in the river sediment samples may indicate small contributions of certain PAHs from pyrogenic sources to the samples.",,"Biogenic hydrocarbons; Chemical fingerprinting; Distribution patterns; Environmental sample; Natural organic matters; Polyaromatic hydrocarbons; Source differentiations; Total petroleum hydrocarbons; Bituminous materials; Carbon; Contamination; Crude oil; Deforestation; Economics; Environmental Protection Agency; Groundwater; Naphthalene; Oil sands; Paraffins; Petroleum chemistry; Rivers; Sediments; Technical presentations; Water quality; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Alkanes; Bitumen; Carbon; Crude Oil; Deforestation; Economics; EPA; Ground Water; Hydrocarbons; Naphthalenes; Pollution; Rivers; Water Quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881409095

The rollout of such large-scale infrastructure would undoubtedly require very large investments. In regions with several CO2 emission sources, it is possible that not all of the major CO2 sources will implement CCS at the same time. Shared oversized pipeline designs are often proposed in order of CO2 sources and serve as the backbone for an expanding CO2 transportation infrastructure, to which emission sources will be connected. This paper analyses the economics of using oversized and parallel pipelines for different typical pipeline length and CO2 flow rate combinations. For new CCS projects, the expansion methodology presented in this paper can identify the optimal pipeline design that minimises the cost per tonne of CO2 avoided over the life of the project. For existing projects, the expansion methodology identifies the optimal pipeline design change, which may include either using an existing pipeline as CO2 supply increases or duplicating pipelines.","CCS economics; CCS scenario; Optimisation",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898725899

Three typical reservoirs were selected, including 2nd Baoshan Reservoir in Hsinchu County, Liyutan Reservoir in Miaoli County, and Tsengwen Reservoir in Chiayi County. Tsengwen is located in tropical zone while the other two are located in subtropical zone. This study followed the methodology in ""GHG Measurement Guidelines for Freshwater Reservoirs"" published by UNESCO in 2010 and used the floating chamber to measure the GHG emissions flux across the water/air interface. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) was analyzed using gas chromatography. All the measurements were conducted in day time due to the safety concern. CH4 and N2O emission fluxes were always positive during the measurement, while CO2 flux might be negative or positive, ranged from -40 to 50 mg m-2 h-1. In most cases, we measured negative CO2 flux, that is, the water body absorbs carbon dioxide, especially when the water level of reservoir is high. In general, the emission from the three reservoirs is similar to the reservoirs in temperate zones. Emission pattern of three sampling points at one reservoir was similar, with the difference among the emissions from the inlet, central point and outlet of reservoir not significant. The possible correlations between the GHG flux and the water/sediment quality are evaluated using linear relationship and the coefficients of determination. CH4 flux may possibly be affected by water depth and suspended solids. N2O flux may be affected by factors like chlorophyll a and conductivity in water. CO2 flux may be affected by various factors like pH, nitrogen substances in water, temperature, water depth, and so on. The correlations of individual reservoirs are largely different and no simple relationship could be clarified from the limited data in the current stage.","Carbon dioxide; Floating chamber; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Water reservoirs","Carbon dioxide; Gas chromatography; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Phase interfaces; Reservoirs (water); Surveys; Tropics; Water levels; Emission pattern; Floating chamber; Freshwater reservoirs; Linear relationships; LiYuTan reservoir; Nitrous oxide; Suspended solids; Water/air interface; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894582798

The port DME energy ratio was proved to be one of main variables affecting the combustion. Thus, the main goals of this paper were to investigate the effects of DME energy ratio on combustion and emission characteristics of the diesel engine at this dual-fuel PCCI combustion mode. In order to evaluate the characteristics of this combustion mode, the conventional direct-injection compression ignition engine performance was provided to make a detailed comparison. Furthermore, special concern was focused on the complex combustion process analysis. DME port induction and diesel in-cylinder direct-injection combustion process was composed of the homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion and conventional diffusive combustion. Although DME energy ratio had little impact on the start timing of cool flame, the negative temperature coefficient region shortened and the start timing of HCCI high-temperature reaction advanced as DME energy ratio increased. It could also be discovered that, as DME energy ratio increased, the maximum heat release rate of DME HCCI increased as well as the peak values of cylinder pressure and mass-averaged temperature; however, the maximum heat release rate of diesel combustion decreased. Results also showed the brake thermal efficiency slightly increased with a rise of DME energy ratio. In the case of emission, smoke emissions decreased, NOx emissions decreased first but this decreasing trend was inhibited later, while HC and CO emissions increased with a rise of DME energy ratio. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Ltd, China","Rich in energy resources, China's Ordos Basin shares many similarities with Wyoming's Powder River Basin. As a result, the experience and expertise pertaining to energy development in the Powder River Basin should prove helpful in the Ordos Basin. The basin's coal, coalbed methane and natural gas reserves are ranked first in China, and its oil reserves are ranked fourth. The coal deposits in the Ordos Basin account for 39 percent of total Chinese coal reserves (3.98 trillion tonnes), and six of the thirteen largest coal mines in China are located in the basin. The overlapping development of relatively new coal conversion industries with existing oil and gas industries in northern Shaanxi Province is creating an opportunity to apply the systematic approach developed in Wyoming: The integration of geological CO2 storage and CO2-EOR. The coal conversion industry (i.e., coal-to-methanol, coal-to-olefins, etc.) provides affordable, capture-ready CO2 sources for developing large-scale integrated CO2-EOR and carbon storage projects in the Ordos Basin, China. Compared with other CCUS projects, the ability to use CO2 from the coalconversion industry for CO 2-EOR and subsequent geological CO2 storage will make integrated projects in the Ordos Basin more cost-effective and technologically efficient. The low porosity, low permeability, low oil saturation, anomalously low reservoir pressure, and high reservoir heterogeneity of the target storage formations in the Ordos Basin make using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery much more challenging here than in the US. These reservoir characteristics together constitute a major reason that CO2- EOR is not widely employed in the Ordos Basin, even though sources of highly concentrated CO2 (coal conversion plants) have been available for years. Comparisons of reservoir and crude oil properties in the Ordos Basin with the current US CO2-EOR screening guidelines reveal that gravity, viscosity, crude oil composition, and formation type of the Ordos reservoirs all are favorable for CO2 miscible flooding. The major challenges in deploying EOR result from anomalously low reservoir pressure, low porosity, and higher reservoir heterogeneity.","Ordos basin",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898767234

The results show that in the context of global and regional warming, the growing season of coniferous forests has been increasing at an average rate of 3.9 d per decade. Regional warming favors the growth of temperate broad-leaved forests and has a detrimental effect on the growth of boreal coniferous forests. Over the past hundred years, the forest edge of the cool temperate zone in the southern Daxing'anling region has retreated 140 km northward. From 1896 to 1986, the northern boundary of broad-leaved forests in Heilongjiang province has extended northwestward about 290 km. Future climatic changes (until 2060) may lead to the northern deciduous needle forests moving out of China's territory altogether. The occurrence cycles of pests and diseases have shortened; their distribution ranges have expanded. The life cycle of tent caterpillars (Malacosoma neustria testacea Motschulsky) has shortened from 14-15 years in the past to 8-10 years now. The pine caterpillar (Dendrolimus tabulaeformis Tsai et Liu), which has spread within western Liaoning province and the nearby areas, can now be found in the north and west. Lightning fires in the Daxing'anling region have significantly increased since 1987, and August has become the month when lightning fires occur most frequently. Overall, the net primary productivity (NPP) of forest in Northeast China has increased. The NPP in 1981 was around 0.27 Pg C, and increased to approximately 0.40 Pg C in 2002. With the current climate, the broad-leaved Korean pine forest ecosystem acts as a carbon sink, with a carbon sink capacity of 2.7 Mg C hm-2. Although the carbon sink capacity of the forest ecosystems in Northeast China has been weakened since 2003, the total carbon absorption will still increase. The forest ecosystems in Northeast China are likely to remain a significant carbon sink, and will play a positive role in the mitigation of climate change.","Climate change; Forest ecosystem; Northeast china",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900013321

The influencing factors of carbon emissions can be decomposed into carbon emissions intensity effects, industrial structure effects, economic development effects, and population growth effects. This study based on the LMDI model, the factors which affected the carbon emissions changes of Henan province, was decomposed from 1990 to 2010. The results show that it is still at a relatively high carbon development stage in Henan Province, the pressure to realize low-carbon development is comparatively large. The direction and strength of the carbon emissions influencing factors were relatively largely different and in continuous dynamic changes. On the whole, the economic development is the main factor to promote the growth of carbon emissions and has contributed the most to the carbon emissions growth; Population growth also played a certain role in promoting the growth of carbon emissions, but is relatively limited. Carbon emission intensity changes are the main factors that inhibit the growth of carbon emissions and play the most significant role in reducing carbon emissions. The adjustment of industrial structure has limited effects on carbon emissions. It is the most effective way to realize low-carbon development, such as changing the energy structure, improving the industrial structure, and thereby reducing the carbon emissions. © 2013 IEEE.","carbon emissions; Henan Province; influencing factors; Logarithmic Mean Disivia Index (LMDI) model","Carbon emission intensities; Carbon emissions; Economic development; Henan Province; Industrial structures; influencing factors; Logarithmic mean; Low-carbon development; Industry; Population statistics; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893294445

Reducing energy consumption will not only cut down the operational costs of data centers, but also reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emissions. In order to improve energy efficiency of servers, a new multi-objective bi-level programming model based on MapReduce is proposed in this paper. In the model, first, the relationship between performance and energy consumption of servers is taken into account. Second, data locality can be adjusted dynamically according to current network state. Third, data placement policies and task-scheduling strategies are considered simultaneously as a whole. In order to solve the model efficiently, specific-designed encoding and decoding methods are introduced. With these, a new effective multi-objective genetic algorithm on the basis of Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) is presented. As tasks involved in cloud computing are usually tens of thousands, a local search operator is designed in order to accelerate convergent speed of the proposed algorithm. Finally, numerical experiments are made and the results indicate the reasonableness of the model and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2013-IOS Press and the author(s).","bi-level programming; data locality; Energy-aware; MapReduce; multi-objective optimization","Bi-level programming; Bilevel programming models; Data locality; Energy aware; Map-reduce; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Reducing energy consumption; Algorithms; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Multiobjective optimization; Telecommunication systems; Cloud computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884539640

Betula ermanii forest grows in the northern slope of Changbai Mountain from approximately 1,700mabove sea level (a.s.l.), andforms the upper tree line at nearly 2,100ma.s.l.. Six study sites were constructed along the altitudinal gradient (1,670 to 2,010 m a.s.l.) and ring-width chronologies of Betula ermanii were built. The mean tree-ring series intercorrelation (RBAR) increasedwith elevation. In principal component analysis, the first unrotatedprinciple component explained77.1% of the total variance, indicating the tree-ring growth of Beutla ermanii over the altitudinal gradient was governed by regional climate. Correlation function analysis revealedthat the radial growth of Betula ermanii was significantly similar in response to climatic conditions. Overall, the low temperatures during previous June, July and during the dormant period (previous October to current May) andthe high temperatures during current June, July andAugust would benefit the radial growth of Betula ermanii. Abundant precipitation during growing season (previous June, July, September andcurrent August), previous November andcurrent May, wouldalso facilitate the tree-ring growth. The reason for this uniform growth behavior in Betula ermanii remainedunclear. Betula ermanii in Changbai Mountain formedrelatively pure stands with an open canopy, which might be partly contributing to the common growth response to climatic signals along the altitudinal gradient, but further work was required for testing this assumption.","Dendroclimatology; Precipitation; Temperature; Tree line; Tree ring","Betula ermanii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878972911

One-year measurements of reactive N species, including ammonium nitrogen (NH+4-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO-3-N) and total organic nitrogen (ON) in dry and wet deposition, were conducted using an automated wet-dry sampler incorporated with a DDAS (dry deposition on aqueous surface) sampling device at Dinghushan (DHS), a natural forest site in the northwest of PRD and at Hengmen (HM), an estuary site in the south of PRD during 2006-2007. Total deposition fluxes of N at DHS and HM were up to 48.2 and 37.8 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively, with most of the deposition occurring in the rainy season. Wet deposition was the dominant form, contributing 65-70% to the total deposition. NH+4-N was the largest contributor to the total N deposition at DHS (47%) due to significant influence of agriculture emissions. ON was the most important N component at HM (41%), which is probably attributed to the marine sources. However, NO-3-N deposition is increasing rapidly recently and is expected to be more important in the near future. The current N deposition level in PRD is much higher than those in Europe and North America. Great challenges exist in reducing reactive N emission in this region. Thus, a scenario of rising N deposition in PRD in the near future cannot be ruled out. The environmental consequences due to elevated N deposition should therefore be paid more attention in the future. © 2013 X.

Sedimentary basins offer an accessible low grade geothermal heat source to launch energetically efficient air-conditioning systems. The natural temperature, porosity and permeability of these sedimentary basins may be sufficient to provide usable geothermal power for heat-driven sorption air-conditioning system. In the Perth metropolitan region, hot sedimentary aquifers with temperatures between 70 and 100 °C are generally available at around 3 km depth or shallower. This paper outlines the possible application of a large scale geothermal absorption air-conditioning system to provide baseload cooling to the main campus of the University of Western Australia (UWA). The conceptual design of this system is proposed. The design considerations and the performance outcomes are presented. The economic analysis based on the real-time cooling load profile at the UWA and the chiller operation scheme demonstrates the viablity of geothermal absorption air-conditioning system.

With the application of the above measures, the total SO2 emissions can be reduced by 50% and the concentration of SO2 in the air can meet with the Class II of national ambient air quality Standard. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","CMAQ model; Economic circle; Pollutants emission reduction; SO2","Annual average concentration; Average concentration; Cmaq models; Economic circles; National ambient air quality standards; Pollutants emissions; Prevention and controls; SO2; Air quality; Boiler control; Building materials; Chemical industry; Emission control; Industrial emissions; Industrial plants; Thermoelectric power plants; Sulfur dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886829800

The N concentration in young organs was higher than that in aged ones and the C/ N ratio was higher in aged organs than that in young ones. The N concentration was higher in all components of the nitrogen-fixing species (E. fordii plantation) than that in other species (C. hystrix and P. massoniana plantations).

The result shows that air pollutant concentration in some zones of the urban agglomeration is higher than the allowable limit of the national grade II standard. Fortunately, such zones only cover a small area. Zones where the average daily and annual PM10 concentration is higher than the allowable limit only account for 4% of the total area of Chengdu urban agglomeration. Less than 1% of the total area has the concentration of other pollutants higher than the limit. Zones with pollutant concentration higher than the limit are mainly distributed in Chengdu City, Mianyang City, and Meishan City. Pollutants emitted from the cities of Chengdu urban agglomeration shift on to and interact with each other. Therefore, the air pollutant concentration of one city is partially attributable to pollutants emitted from its own pollution sources and a part of or even most of it results from pollutants from other cities. For example, regarding PM10 in air of Deyang City, only 12% comes from its own pollution sources, and 55% comes from pollution sources of Chengdu, and the rest 29% comes from pollution sources of Mianyang. Regarding Sulfur dioxide in air of Chengdu, 59% comes from local pollution sources of Chengdu and 23% comes from pollution sources of Deyang. Other pollutants are also subject to such a rule. As in the urban agglomeration, there are zones where pollutant concentration is higher than the allowable limit, the existing pollution sources must be further controlled by setting reduction target according to the total capacity. The pollutant emission should be reduced by means of eliminating backward productivity, adjusting structure and layout of industries, and controlling pollution sources in depth to effectively improve the regional environmental air quality. At the same time, as pollutants emitted from the cities interact with each other, the 5 cities must sign a joint prevention and control agreement to collaborate in control of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, smoke and dust, and organic pollutants. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Capacity total content control; Joint prevention and control of air pollution; Mesoscale atmospheric dispersion; Simulation of environmental air quality","Adjusting structure; Air pollutant concentrations; Atmospheric dispersion; Chengdu; Community multi-scale air quality models; Environmental quality; In-control; Local pollutions; PM10 concentration; Pollutant concentration; Pollutant emission; Pollution sources; Reduction targets; Small area; Total content; Agglomeration; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Nitrogen oxides; Smoke abatement; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871895388

Air pollutants emitted from exhaust gases of rice husk incineration lead to environmental damage, not only because of the influence on global environment and climate, when released into the atmosphere, but also on human health due to local air pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively utilize waste rice husk and straw to reduce air pollutants. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand on the utilization of unused biomass instead of fossil oil fuel in combustors for farming-greenhouses heating during the winter season. The increasing demand will increase the running costs. In general, since these combustors are small in size, there is a lack of regulations or laws (e.g. The Air Pollution Control Act and The Waste Disposal and Public Cleaning Law) in operation for their air pollution control. So far, small size combustors are characterized by their simplicity of structure and low costs. However, they emit visible black carbon (elemental carbon) due to their poor combustion performance. In this study, we investigated that the possibility of the substitution of fossil fuel by waste rice husk and rice straw in laboratory model combustion experiments. We evaluated the emission behavior of harmful air pollutants emitted from rice husk and straw combustion by measuring carbonaceous and ionic composition of suspended particulate matter in the exhaust gases. From the analytical results we found that particulate mass concentrations reduced substantially at high temperature combustion. From the results of our study, it can be suggested that stable combustion performance under suitable conditions in order to control less air pollutants emitted from biomass fuel although small size combustors are still not regulated. © 2013 WIT Press.","Carbonaceous; Combustion conditions; Ionic and metallic composition; PM2.5; Rice husk and rice straw; Small size combustors","atmospheric pollution; combustion; crop residue; exhaust emission; incineration; pollution control; straw; suspended particulate matter; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887583765

The tragedy of the commons might better be described as the failure of governing the commons. Hardin's solutions were centralized government and private property, which have long been criticized as oversimplified. However, governing the unprecedented climate commons, there is only a global federalism of climate policy - the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto cannot keep atmospheric CO2 level below 450 ppm (rising 2 °C). Some key evidences of the Kyoto failures are identified. The Kyoto failures do not indicate that the Kyoto is a wrong tool of centralized government. Instead, the Kyoto failures are derived from the fact that the only centralized government cannot effectively govern the commons, which have been proven by the efforts of governing the commons last four decades. Here we propose a wide diversity of governance systems for climate common to addressing global warming. The multi-level and multi-scale governing system includes but is not limited to: (i) starting at home, (ii) emphasizing the local approach, (iii) efforts of global-level focusing these top emitters, (iv) improved information sharing, (v) privatizing the property of climate to avoid free riders, (vi) combination mitigation with adaptive, (vii) improved ecology services to expand carbon sinks. We argue that the Kyoto failures indicate again that reliance on a single solution may result in more of a problem than a solution in governing the common.

Following the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, we estimated the energy-related CO2 emissions in Guangdong during the period of 1980-2010. We employed the logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) method to decompose the CO2 emissions into energy intensity, energy structure, per capita GDP and population scale effects. Besides, we deduced the calculation methods for the year by year effects, the accumulated effects and the contribution degrees. Using 1980 as the base year, the empirical results show that the accumulated effects of energy intensity and energy structure in 2010 are negative, while those of per capita GDP and population scale are positive. Per capita GDP is the chief positive influence on the CO2 emissions. Energy intensity is becoming more significant; however, its direction is instability. Population scale has a significant positive effect on the CO2 emissions. Energy structure has a negligible negative impact on the CO2 emissions.

Thus far, scenarios have mostly been defined according to a sequential, piecewise process in which experts create plausible storylines that are then used as inputs to formal models. However, as the storylines are drafted separately from model construction, it is often difficult for models to engage completely with scenario themes. As a solution, methods of 'scenario discovery' have been proposed which apply statistical techniques to sets of model simulations to identify regions of the stochastic parameter space that result in distinctively different levels of policy performance. In our previous work, we described a novel multiattribute scenario discovery method and demonstrated application to ENGAGE, an agent-based model (ABM) of economic growth, energy technology, and carbon emissions. In the current contribution, we further demonstrate the utility of this approach by using ENGAGE to generate socioeconomic scenarios relevant to a given emissions target. We find that population growth, improvement in labor productivity, and efficiency of learning-by-doing regarding carbon-free energy technology are the key factors driving the success rate in achieving the selected target. This implies that these features should form essential elements of the storylines underlying socioeconomic scenarios if they are to provide a meaningful exploration of policy efficacy. Such results are consistent with those of more conceptual approaches. However, by being derived from the results of a quantitative model, our formulation is intrinsically consistent with practicable modeling assumptions and specifications. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888326915

The soil deformation is mainly elastic deformation, and the maximum occurs near the medial axis. The released volume concentration of carbon monoxide was relatively high from shield tail to trolley 5 under dynamic conditions, but it is large for internal soil chamber under static conditions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Carbon monoxide; Sea reclamation district; Shield tunnel; Soil deformation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079815049

The convex and concave structures of the flame front were detected and statistical analysis including PDF and ADF of the local radius of curvature and the local flame angle was conducted. Results showed that the flame front of turbulent premixed flames at high pressure and high temperature is a wrinkled flame front with small scale convex and concave cusps superimposed on large scale branches, while the whole flame front tends to be convex to the unburned mixture. The effect of EGR gas dilution on the flame front structure of turbulent premixed flames is dominated by CO2 rather than H2O dilution. The quantitative flame front characteristics reveal the complicated effect of CO2 dilution on turbulent premixed flames characteristics observed in our previous research. In the case of CO2 dilution, some local wrinkled structures become sharp and propagate deep into the burned mixture, resulting in a decrease of the fractal inner cutoff scale, the formation of a thick flame brush and the enlargement of the mean flame volume, while the overall wrinkled scale increases significantly due to the suppression of the concave structure with CO 2 dilution, leading to a decrease of the turbulent flame front area, and subsequently to a decrease of ST/SL. © 2012 The Combustion Institute.","Dilution; Flame front; High pressure; High temperature; Turbulent premixed flames","Dilution; Fractals; Mixtures; Concave structures; Flame front; High pressure; High pressure and high temperature; High temperature; Local radius; Turbulent flame; Turbulent premixed flame; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877688181

However, our understanding of processes associated with these boundaries remains comparatively undeveloped. Cropland-grassland mosaics resulting from intensification of farming activity on extensive grassland are now common in north of China. These land use changes not only influence the original ecosystem processes but also generate new ecological processes that impact on the regional environment at a larger scale. Recently the topic of spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture has received more attention from ecologists because it plays an important role in the hydrological cycle through effects on the interaction between land and atmosphere, thus climate and plant growth in different ecological scales. Despite this emerging focus few studies have examined the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture in cropland-grassland mosaics in north of China. Here we report data investigating the spatial pattern for soil moisture variation in cropland (C), the cropland-grassland boundary (B) and grassland (G) of a sizes (0.5 m×0.5 m, 1 m×1 m, 2 m×2 m) using classical statistical and geostatistical methodologies. Soil water content of C was significantly higher than that of G (P&lt;0.05). Soil water content of B was intermediate between C and G and differed significantly from both C and G (P&lt;0.05). The B zone displayed a higher coefficient of variation (CV) for soil moisture than the adjacent systems (P &lt; 0. 05), The geostatistical analysis determined that values of the magnitude of spatial heterogeneity (MSH) for soil moisture for B were 0.814, 0.763 and 0.883, respectively, in the three sampling grain sizes (0.5 m×0.5 m, 1 m×1 m, 2 m×2 m). There was also a strong autocorrelation with the ranges A0 15.44, 27.24 and 19.09 m, respectively. The MSH values of soil moisture for G were 0.537, 0.837 and 0.650, and there was a moderate to strong autocorrelation with the ranges A0 6.009, 12.74 and 30.99 m, respectively, in the three different sampling grain sizes. The MSH of soil moisture for C was 0.706, which had a moderate autocorrelation with range 27.28 m in grain size 2 m×2 m, whereas there were nugget effects at the other finer sampling grain sizes. The MSH of the cropland-grassland mosaic displayed a nonlinear relationship across different sampling scales in the field. We found soil moisture for B displayed the highest spatial heterogeneity (i. e. significant patchiness), whereas the soil moisture for C was more homogeneous in comparison with soils under grassland. With respect to the characteristics of the B transition zone, there was an abrupt change of increase then rapidly decreases for soil moisture from cropland to grassland in the cropland-grassland mosaic. The data therefore support the 'ecological boundary effects' hypothesis that the ecological boundary is more heterogeneous than that of the adjacent systems and also show that abrupt ecological boundary effects occur. Our results suggest that the historical shift from perennial herb to monocrop culture in grasslands ecosystem led to changes in the small-scale spatial structure of soil moisture and related processes. These changes in land utilization may therefore alter ecosystem function and further impact the regional climate.","Boundary effect; Cropland-grassland mosaic; Soil moisture; Spatial heterogeneity","agricultural intensification; agricultural land; agricultural management; autocorrelation; data set; ecosystem function; fragmentation; geostatistics; grain size; grassland; herb; heterogeneity; homogeneity; hydrological cycle; magnitude; nonlinearity; pasture; regional climate; soil moisture; soil water; spatial analysis; transition zone; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885443156

In this paper, we proposed a transport control and management method for solving traffic jam and reducing emission in roundabout. The platform of motor vehicle testing system and VSP-based emission model was established firstly. By using the topology chart of the roundabout and microsimulation software, we calculated the instantaneous emission rates of different vehicle and total vehicle emissions. We argued that Integration-Model, combing traffic simulation and vehicle emission, can be performed to calculate the instantaneous emission rates of different vehicle and total vehicle emissions at the roundabout. By contrasting the exhaust emissions result between no signal control and signal control in this area at the rush hour, it draws a conclusion that setting the optimizing signal control can effectively reduce the regional vehicle emission. The proposed approach has been submitted to a simulation and experiment that involved an environmental assessment in Satellite Square, a roundabout in medium city located in China. It has been verified that setting signal control with knowledge engineering and Integration-Model is a practical way for solving the traffic jams and environmental pollution. © 2013 Haiwei Wang et al.",,"Environmental assessment; Environmental pollutions; Motor vehicle emissions; Reducing emissions; Software simulation; Traffic bottleneck; Traffic simulations; Urban road traffic; Computer software; Environmental impact; Street traffic control; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Traffic signals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893872677

Hydrological simulation is an important approach to studying climate change impacts. In this paper, a snowmelt-based water balance model (SWBM) was used to simulate the effect of climate change on runoffin the Kuye River catchment of the Loess Plateau, China. Results indicated that the SWBM is suitable for simulating monthly discharge into arid catchments. The response of runoffin the Kuye River catchment to climate change is nonlinear, and runoffis more sensitive to changes in precipitation than to changes in temperature. The projections indicated that the Kuye River catchment would undergo more flooding in the 2020s, and global warming would probably shorten the main flood season in the catchment, with greater discharge occurring in August. Although projected changes in annual runoffare uncertain, the possibilities of regional water shortages and regional flooding are essential issues that need to be fully considered. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.",,"catchment; climate change; climate effect; computer simulation; flooding; global warming; hydrological cycle; river system; runoff; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885918394

For example, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted as byproducts of fossil fuel combustion are key precursors to ground-level ozone and aerosol formation. In addition, on-road vehicles are major CO2 emitters. In order to tackle these problems, molecular hydrogen (H2) has been proposed as an energy carrier to substitute for fossil fuels in the future. However, before implementing any such strategy it is crucial to evaluate its potential impacts on air quality and climate. Here, we evaluate the impact of a future (2050) H2-based road transportation sector on tropospheric chemistry and air quality for several possible growth and technology adoption scenarios. The growth scenarios are based on the high and low emissions Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, A1FI and B1, respectively. The technological adoption scenarios include H2 fuel cell and H 2 internal combustion engine options. The impacts are evaluated with the Community Atmospheric Model Chemistry global chemistry transport model (CAM-Chem). Higher resolution simulations focusing on the contiguous United States are also carried out with the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) regional chemistry transport model. For all scenarios future air quality improves with the adoption of a H2-based road transportation sector; however, the magnitude and type of improvement depend on the scenario. Model results show that the adoption of H2 fuel cells would decrease tropospheric burdens of ozone (7%), CO (14%), NOx (16%), soot (17%), sulfate aerosol (4%), and ammonium nitrate aerosol (12%) in the A1FI scenario, and would decrease those of ozone (5%), CO (4%), NOx (11%), soot (7%), sulfate aerosol (4%), and ammonium nitrate aerosol (9%) in the B1 scenario. The adoption of H2 internal combustion engines would decrease tropospheric burdens of ozone (1%), CO (18%), soot (17%), and sulfate aerosol (3%) in the A1FI scenario, and would decrease those of ozone (1%), CO (7%), soot (7%), and sulfate aerosol (3%) in the B1 scenario. In the future, people residing in the contiguous United States could expect to experience significantly fewer days of elevated levels of pollution if a H2 fuel cell road transportation sector were to be adopted. Health benefits of transitioning to a H2 economy for citizens in developing nations, like China and India, will be much more dramatic, particularly in megacities with severe, intensifying air-quality problems. © 2013 Author(s).",,"air quality; alternative fuel; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; developing world; fuel cell; hydrogen; road transport; technology adoption; troposphere; China; India; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879989741

CO2 sequestration in saline aquifers plays an important role in effectively reducing the greenhouse gas emission. Numerical modeling can be used to quantitatively analyze the effect of some formation properties on the storage processes of CO2 in saline aquifers. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology may be used to observe the evolution of CO2 plume through time in porous rocks and hence provide an effective means for validate the reliability of the numerical modeling. Based on a combined use of the numerical modeling and the MRI measurement of the vertical injection of the supercritical CO2 into water-saturated rock cores, this study presents a lab-scale investigation on the influence of the heterogeneous and anisotropic permeability, the CO2 injection rate and capillary pressure on the transport of CO2 plume as well as the CO2 utilization efficiency of subsurface space in saline aquifers. Our results indicate: 1) both the heterogeneity and the anisotropy of permeability can enhance the CO2 displacement efficiency. Ignoring these two permeability properties can cause the obvious deviation in the predicted CO 2 saturation and transport processes by the model; 2) the enhanced sequestration efficiency by the anisotropy depends on the degree and spatial extension of itself. If the approximately stochastically distributed permeability anisotropy represents natural conditions, specifying the constant ratio of the vertical permeability to the horizontal one in the model to mimic the real permeability can lead to the obvious over-estimation of the CO 2 displacement efficiency. Besides, the displacement front of the CO2 plume tends to pass through the region with the higher vertical permeability, thus forming the anomalistic shape of the displacement front; 3) the capillary pressure can influence the CO2 utilization efficiency in the rock core significantly, and tends to inhibit the movement of pore water, which accordingly lowers the CO2 displacement efficiency; 4) the CO2 injection rate can largely affect the CO2displacement efficiency. The final CO2 saturation of CO2 in the rock core is notably enhanced with the increasing injection rate.","Capillary pressure; Injection rate; Magnetic resonance imaging; Numerical simulation; Permeability",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898767586

The rumen of buffalo is fermentation vat capable of producing volatile fatty acids and synthesizing microbial protein for the hosts' use. In addition, rumen methane is also produced and eructated out to the environment. Conducted researches have revealed significant information pertaining to the uniqueness of the buffalo rumen hosting a higher population of predominant species of cellulolytic bacteria and fungal zoospores, but with a lower protozoal population. Moreover, they produce a high concentration of rumen ammonia nitrogen and ability for rumen nitrogen recycling. Currently, the use of bio-molecular techniques can reveal additional interesting information concerning rumen microorganisms and their potential role in improving rumen fermentation and the detoxification processes in the rumen, as well as for swamp buffalo productivity. Using nested PCR, the results were found that the strain of Synnergistes jonesii was present in swamp buffaloes consuming high level of Leucaena. Local feed resources availability in various seasons can contribute as essential sources of carbohydrate and protein and can significantly impact to the rumen fermentation and the subsequent productivity of the buffalo. Development of the food-feed-system (FFS) can increase food for human and feed for the buffalo as well as enrich the nitrogen for the soil. Regarding digestibility, they are capable of digesting low-quality roughages and crop-residues with a digestibility of up to about five percent units higher than in cattle. Relating to rumen fermentation, the use of plant secondary compounds such as condensed tannins, saponins, dietary rich in minerals, as well as garlic and vegetable oils, have subsequently resulted in decreasing rumen protozoa, methanogens and methane mitigation. Rumen manipulation in buffaloes using dietary strategies should be recommended.","Fermentation; Food-feed-system; Local feed resources; Methane; NPN; Rumen ecology; Swamp buffalo",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888189299

The increase in meat consumption is quite dramatic, due to the linearly increase in the world population especially in the developing countries. As buffaloes have been raised by the rural farmers, welladapted to harsh environment and are capable of utilizing low quality roughages especially the agricultural crop-residues and by-products, hence their potential are therefore remarkable in terms of meat and milk production using locally available feed resources. Furthermore, the quality of buffalo meat has been found high in iron and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which are essential for good health. Global warming has been attributed by various sources including animal agriculture. Rumen fermentation can be manipulated by many ways in order to increase fermentation efficiency and to mitigate methane production. Although the world buffalo population has been slightly increasing, their vital role are accountable for the demand of meat and milk. Manipulation of the rumen in reducing methane using chemicals, feed additives, roughage and concentrate utilization, use of plants containing secondary compound, oils have been reported. However, among many approaches, nutritional manipulation by using feeding management and especially the use of plant extracts or plant containing secondary compounds (condensed tannins and saponins) have been receiving more attention and most promising. At the current stage, more research concerning this hot issue with the role of livestock on global warming warrants further research undertakings. It is therefore highly recommended for those engage in buffalo production to do more research and to expand the world buffalo production in order to meet the increasing demand of meat and milk.

Macro-spatial short-term trends are driven predominantly by prior (lagged) seasonal changes in climate, which regulate the abundance of suitable aquatic larval habitats. Micro-spatial distribution is determined by the location of these habitats, proximity and abundance of available human bloodmeals and prevailing micro-climatic conditions. The challenge of analysing - in a single coherent statistical framework - the lagged and distributed effect of seasonal climate changes simultaneously with the effects of an underlying hierarchy of spatial factors has hitherto not been addressed. Methods. Data on Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto and A. funestus collected from households in Kilifi district, Kenya, were analysed using polynomial distributed lag generalized linear mixed models (PDL GLMMs). Results: Anopheline density was positively and significantly associated with amount of rainfall between 4 to 47 days, negatively and significantly associated with maximum daily temperature between 5 and 35 days, and positively and significantly associated with maximum daily temperature between 29 and 48 days in the past (depending on Anopheles species). Multiple-occupancy households harboured greater mosquito numbers than single-occupancy households. A significant degree of mosquito clustering within households was identified. Conclusions: The PDL GLMMs developed here represent a generalizable framework for analysing hierarchically-structured data in combination with explanatory variables which elicit lagged effects. The framework is a valuable tool for facilitating detailed understanding of determinants of the spatio-temporal distribution of Anopheles. Such understanding facilitates delivery of targeted, cost-effective and, in certain circumstances, preventative antivectorial interventions against malaria. © 2013 Walker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Anopheles funestus; Anopheles gambiae; Household occupancy; Kenya; Kilifi; Larval habitats; Malaria; Mosquito density; Polynomial distributed lag generalized linear mixed models; Rainfall; Temperature","Anopheles; Anopheles funestus; Anopheles gambiae; article; climate change; cost effectiveness analysis; disease transmission; explanatory variable; habitat; household; human; incubation time; Kenya; malaria; malaria falciparum; mosquito; nonhuman; Plasmodium falciparum; probability; seasonal variation; Anopheles funestus; Anopheles gambiae; Animals; Anopheles; Humans; Insect Vectors; Kenya; Malaria; Population Density; Time Factors; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886147882

Concentrations of CO decreased from 1970 to 2012, and in 2012, the Japanese environmental quality standard (EQS) for CO was satisfied. Concentrations of SO2 dropped markedly in the 1970s, owing to use of desulfurization technologies and low-sulfur heavy oil. Major reductions in the sulfur content of diesel fuel in the 1990s resulted in further decreases of SO2 levels. In 2012, the EQS for SO2 was satisfied at most air quality monitoring stations. Concentrations of NO2 decreased from 1970 to 1985, but increased from 1985 to 1995. After 1995, NO2 concentrations decreased, especially after 2006.

In 2012, the EQS for OX was not satisfied at most air quality monitoring stations. Non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) concentrations generally decreased from 1976 to 2012. In 2011, NMHC concentrations near roads and in the general environment were nearly the same. The concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) generally decreased. In 2011, the EQS for SPM was satisfied at 69.2% of ambient air monitoring stations, and 72.9% of roadside air-monitoring stations. Impacts from mineral dust from continental Asia were especially pronounced in the western part of Japan in spring, and year-round variation was large. The concentration of PM2.5 generally decreased, but the EQS for PM2.5 is still not satisfied. The air pollution trends were closely synchronized with promulgation of regulations designed to limit pollutant emissions. Trans-boundary OX and PM2.5 has become a big issue which contains global warming chemical species such as ozone and black carbon (so called SLCP: Short Lived Climate Pollutants). Cobeneficial reduction approach for these pollutants will be important to improve both in regional and global atmospheric environmental conditions.","Air pollution trends and countermeasures; Air quality standards; Criteria pollutants; Photochemical oxidants; Secondary pollutants; Volatile organic compounds",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893419620

This work explores the kinetic and thermal effects of diluent gas composition on autoignition at concentrations relevant to internal combustion engines, rapid compression machines, and shock tubes. Pressure-time histories were computed with CHEMKIN software for a closed 0-D homogeneous reactor under adiabatic and constant volume conditions for the two primary reference fuels, iso-octane and n-heptane, and for a representative alcohol, n-butanol. Stoichiometric mixtures, φ = 1.0, and a temperature range of 600-1100 K were considered. The alkanes were studied at initial pressures of 9.0 atm and 60.0 atm, and the alcohol was studied at initial pressures of 3.2 atm and 60.0 atm. The fuels and simulation conditions were selected based on the relevance to engine operating conditions and previously published experimental studies, including data from the University of Michigan rapid compression facility. Dilution of 5.64:1 (mole basis) and 3.76:1 of buffer gas to O2 were considered. Diluent gases considered in this study were argon, nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxide. The model results were characterized by ignition delay times, pressure-time histories, and heat release rates. The heat release rates were sensitive to diluent composition with carbon dioxide exhibiting relatively high levels of early and late heat release relative to the other buffer gases. Local sensitivity analysis of the third-body collision efficiencies for the diluent gases indicated that lowerature combustion was particularly sensitive to the effects of buffer gas composition. This study highlights the significance of buffer gas composition on the uncertainties in lowerature combustion chemistry, particularly H2O2 and HO2 decomposition and recombination reactions. Buffer gas compostion was found to impact the ignition delay time and heat release rates most in the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region for the fuels studied (with changes of greater than a factor of 2 in ignition delay time and heat release rate). Outside the NTC region, the effects of changes in buffer gas composition were small (&lt;20%).",,"Alcohol fuels; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Engines; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gases; Heptane; Internal combustion engines; Nitrogen; Sensitivity analysis; Shock tubes; Temperature; Engine operating conditions; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Local sensitivity analysis; Primary reference fuels; Rapid compression facilities; Rapid compression machine; Recombination reactions; Stoichiometric mixtures; Ignition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943416508

However, these emission tests are usually cost-ineffective and time-consuming. It is also difficult to enforce the vehicle owners on monitoring the health of their engines daily and taking immediate action to fix their vehicle emission problems. Therefore, this paper proposes a new vehicle emission inspection and notification system to help daily monitoring of engine health through the concept of Internet of Things. As there are numerous traffic lights in an urban area, they are employed to play an important role in the proposed system. By the fact that every car must stop in front of red lights, reliable reading of air ratio (λ) from a vehicle, which indicates the engine emission status, can be interrogated wirelessly through mature and low-price radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. By inspecting the λ in real time, the vehicle emissions can be effectively controlled by the governmental authorities. Meanwhile, several implementation issues have also been considered and analyzed in this paper. An innovative method is proposed to select the appropriate traffic lights on which RFID monitoring devices should be installed. © 2013 IEEE.","emission control; Internet of Things; maximum spanning trees component; radio frequency identification; vehicle emissions inspection","Emission control; Engines; Exhibitions; Inspection; Internet; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Governmental authorities; Internet of Things (IOT); Maximum spanning tree; Notification systems; Pollution problems; Radio frequency identification technology; Vehicle emission; Vehicle inspections; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899921632

This paper aims to develop such parameters, indicating possibilities for reducing power consumption and emissions of pollutants. Different platforms have different oilfield conditions and process specifications. Such conditions determine the theoretical minimum work required to operate the platforms, and can have a high impact on the power consumption. We introduce performance indicators based on energy and exergy. The specific energy use and specific exergy consumption evaluate the resources spent to produce the exported petroleum. The best-available-technology efficiency compares the current energy use with the energy use if state-of-the-art components replace current compressors and pumps. Exergetic efficiency compares the actual resources spent in the current process with the minimum resources required under ideal conditions (i.e. reversible operation), and specific exergy destruction illustrates the amount of resources lost due to irreversibilities. We use these indicators to evaluate the oil and gas processing at four different North Sea platforms that differ by the field lifetime, system configuration and reservoir properties. Both the specific energy use and the specific exergy consumption ranged between 20 and 667 MJ/Sm3 o.e. in the four cases. The best-available-technology efficiencies showed that the energy use of the different platforms could be reduced by 17% to 44% if the most efficient technologies existing on the market were used. The exergetic efficiencies were 99.4%-99.9%, 50%-84% or 2%-46%, depending on the interpretation of product exergy and fuel/utilized exergy, while specific exergy destruction ranged from 17 to 162 MJ/Sm3 o.e. The platforms with best performances in specific energy use and exergy consumption did not necessarily have the highest best-available-technology or exergetic efficiencies. This illustrates the importance of considering different types of indicators when evaluating the performance of oil and gas platforms.","Energy; Exergy; Oil and gas platforms; Performance indicators","Benchmarking; Environmental impact; Oil fields; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Technology; Efficient technology; Energy; Exergetic efficiency; Offshore oil and gas platforms; Oil and gas platforms; Performance indicators; Process specification; System configurations; Exergy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903592252

One of the benefits of introducing electric and hybridelectric vehicles into the fleet is the reduction of exhaust and to a lesser extent evaporative emissions from vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. Such reductions are often based on average emissions rates of the regulated pollutants. In reality, electric vehicles are being introduced in a rather selective manner, with preference to low speed, short distance urban trips, due to energy storage limitations. As a coincidence, during such operating regimes, the internal combustion engines are at their worst not only in terms of efficiency and emissions of regulated pollutants, but, more importantly, in terms of the health effects caused by these emissions. Deployment of electric drive vehicles in congested urban areas, where it appears most advantageous technically and economically, is therefore expected to have relatively high benefits to human health due to reduced exhaust emissions. Current patterns of electric drive deployment therefore already appear to be close to optimal in terms of their benefits to air quality. © 2009-2012 IEEE.",,"Air quality; Fleet operations; Internal combustion engines; Optimization; Pollution; Vehicles; Electric-drive vehicles; Evaporative emission; Hybrid-electric vehicles; Operating regimes; Prague , Czech Republic; Regulated pollutants; Storage limitation; Vehicle exhaust emissions; Electric drives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887477879

The goals of the OCMP study were to estimate offsite impacts and facilitate selection of odor mitigation measures and process changes. Sampling for composite odor was conducted along with other air emissions to obtain process-related data. Liquid testing was performed to develop an understanding of the precursors for odor emissions and process variables that may cause odor.

Reducing these N2O emissions requires a better understanding of the factors driving emissions and evaluation of mitigation strategies. Computer simulation models can provide an effective tool for these tasks. We compared two process-based models, APSIM and NZ-DNDC, on results of three experiments on N2O emissions following urine application to the Horotiu soil in the Waikato region of New Zealand in various seasons and years. Soil ammonium and nitrate concentrations were also determined in the experiments. With default parameter settings, both models predicted the daily pattern of N2O emissions poorly (Figure 1) with negative model efficiencies. The sensitivity of various model parameters was examined: For APSIM these included the nitrification rate, the optimum soil temperature on nitrification, the fraction of nitrified N emitted as N2O, the denitrification rate, and the rainfall intensity. For DNDC they were microbial activity, nitrification rate, denitrification rate, plant growth, ammonia volatilisation, rainfall intensity, and fraction of N2O produced during nitrification were varied. Changing some of the default model parameters improved the model agreement in some cases; e.g. for APSIM when the fraction of nitrified nitrogen emitted as N2O was increased or the optimum temperature for nitrification was decreased, and for DNDC when microbial activity was decreased or volatilization increased. However, none of the parameters investigated could improve predicted emissions so that they agreed reasonably with all three datasets. A sensitivity analysis which includes more parameters and model functions, as well as changing various parameters simultaneously is needed. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Ammonium; APSIM; DNDC; Nitrous oxide emissions; Soil nitrate","Agriculture; Ammonia; Denitrification; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrates; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Operations research; Rain; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Agricultural greenhouse; Ammonium; APSIM; DNDC; Nitrate concentration; Nitrous oxide emissions; Process-based models; Various model parameters; Soil pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080957267

A recent study showed that 14CO2 emissions from the nuclear industry can significantly alter the local atmospheric 14CO2 concentration and thus mask the Δ14C depletion due to DFFCO2. In this study, we investigate the relevance of this effect for the vicinity of Toronto, Canada, a hot spot of anthropogenic 14CO2 emissions. Comparing the measured emissions from local power plants to a global emission inventory highlighted significant deviations on interannual timescales.

This causes a mean difference of -14% in 14CO2 concentrations in our simulations at our observational site in Egbert, Canada. On an annual time basis, this additional 14CO2 masks the equivalent of 27-82% of the total annual FFCO2 offset. A pseudo-data experiment suggests that the interannual variability in the masked fraction may cause spurious trends in the DFFCO2 estimates of the order of 30% from 2006-2010. In addition, a comparison of the modeled Δ14C levels with our observational time series from 2008-2010 underlines that incorporating the best available 14CO2 emissions significantly increases the agreement. There were also short periods with significant observed Δ14C offsets, which were found to be linked with maintenance periods conducted on these nuclear reactors. © 2013 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.","14CO2; Anthropogenic emissions; Fossil fuel CO2","anthropogenic effect; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; estimation method; fossil fuel; global perspective; nuclear power plant; parameterization; simulation; Canada; Egbert; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884378346

In the present study, we investigate potentials and challenges when combining observational data with simulations using high-resolution atmospheric transport and emission modelling. These challenges concern, for example, erroneous vertical mixing or uncertainties in the disaggregation of national total emissions to higher spatial and temporal resolution. In our study, the hourly regional fossil fuel CO2 offset (δFFCO2) is simulated by transporting emissions from a 5 min×5 min emission model (IER2005) that provides FFCO2 emissions from different emission categories. Our Lagrangian particle dispersion model (STILT) is driven by 25 km×25 km meteorological data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). We evaluate this modelling framework (STILT/ECMWF+IER2005) for the year 2005 using hourly DFFCO2 estimates derived from 14C, CO and 222Radon (222Rn) observations at an urban site in south-western Germany (Heidelberg). Analysing the mean diurnal cycles of δFFCO2 for different seasons, we find that the large seasonal and diurnal variation of emission factors used in the bottom-up emission model (spanning one order of magnitude) are adequate. Furthermore, we show that the use of 222Rn as an independent tracer helps to overcome problems in timing as well as strength of the vertical mixing in the transport model. By applying this variability correction, the model-observation agreement is significantly improved for simulated δFFCO2. We found a significant overestimation of δFFCO2 concentrations during situations where the air masses predominantly originate from densely populated areas. This is most likely caused by the spatial disaggregation methodology for the residential emissions, which to some extent relies on a constant per capita-based distribution. In the case of domestic heating emissions, this does not appear to be sufficient. © 2013 F. R.

An adsorption/desorption experiment was also performed to assess the retention capacity of substrates tested against fungicide metalaxyl. The goal of the work was to determine the extent of the adsorption/desorption of the mobile fungicide metalaxyl in substrates containing different amounts and quality of organic carbon and to characterize the relationship between the carbon fractions and the adsorption/desorption parameters determined. The Kads values found in the organic substrates turned out to be higher than those reported for soils, indicating the highest sorption capability of these materials and their suitability to be used as bio-filters for decontaminating water. The quality of organic carbon strongly influenced the entity and the reversibility of bonds between substrates and fungicide. The influence of different organic fractions on the adsorption of metalaxyl can be summarized in the order of humic acids carbon &lt; total humified extractable carbon &gt; total organic carbon &gt; total carbon, leading to the conclusion that the presence of the humified fraction in the organic substrates is essential for a good performance of biofilters. Indeed, the desorption experiment evidenced that metalaxyl is less desorbed in the most humified substrates. Therefore, in bio-depuration systems such as biobed it is convenient to use mature substrates, which have to undergo a composting process, leading to high humus content and quality, responsible for irreversible bonds with pesticides. © by PSP.","Adsorption; Desorption; Metalaxyl; Organic carbon fractions","adsorption; agricultural soil; biofiltration; composting; desorption; forest soil; fungicide; humic acid; humus; laboratory method; substrate; total organic carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875656852

Photocatalysis refers to charge-carrier, i.e. electron and hole, mediated reactions occurring on a semiconductor surface in presence of ultraviolet or visible light radiation. Photocatalysis is a well established advanced oxidation technique for the decontamination of toxic organic pollutants to CO2 and H2O. However, the generation of energy in the form of hydrogen, hydrocarbon fuels and electricity via photocatalysis is an upcoming field with great many technical challenges towards practical implementation. This review will describe the fundamental reaction mechanism of (i) photocatalytic water splitting, (ii) photocatalytic H2 generation in presence of different sacrificial agents, (iii) H2 and electricity generation in a photofuel cell, (iv) photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons and useful chemicals, and (v) photocatalytic water-gas shift reaction. A historic and recent perspective of the above conversion techniques, especially with regard to the development of TiO2-based and non-TiO2 materials is provided. The activity of different materials for the above reactions based on quantifiers like reaction rate, quantum yield and incident-photon-to-current efficiency is compared, and key design considerations of the ""best"" photocatalyst or photoelectrode is outlined. An overall assessment of the research area indicates that the presently achieved quantum efficiencies for the above reactions are rather moderate in the visible region, and the goal is to develop a catalyst that absorbs visible radiation, provides good charge-carrier separation, and exhibits high stability for long periods of usage. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Co2; Electricity generation; Hydrogen generation; Photocatalysis; Photoelectrocatalysis; Photofuel cell; Reduction; TiO2; Water splitting; Water-gas shift reaction",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893174749

We developed a method for estimation of efficiency of existing preparations and for qualitative evaluation of the degree of carbon compounds degradation.

The experiments wede done in the conditions very close to the arctic (on the White Sea Biological Station and in a laboratory setting. We have isolated several microbial communities that are able to perform the destruction oil carbohydrates. On the basis of these communities, we plan to create the preparations highly effective in the arctic conditions. Utilization of oily wastes in the low temperatures conditions is of great actuality when developing oil fields in the far north. In the moderate climate regions, oil residuals (after the physical and/or physic-chemical purification) are utilized by soil microorganisms or using several commercially available microbial preparations that accelerate the process. The active components of such preparations are usually carbohydrate-oxidizing microorganisms that are able to perform oil conversion into the bacterial biomass of organisms that, in turn, transfer the oily wastes into the safe components. These biopreparations are actively used after the physical and/or physic-chemical remediation. Microbial bioremedation allows effective utilization of residual oily wastes, if using of other methods is economically unadvizable, technically complicated and/or ecologically unsafe. At the same time, the end-product of microbial conversion of oily wastes is the biomass of carbohydrate-oxidizing bacteria which serves as a feed for the other organisms of this geobiocoenosis. The literature search has shown that nowadays many preparations are developed that are aimed to the control of the oily wastes. These preparations are masses of viable microorganisms-biodestructors and differ one from another by strains used for their creation.

A lean burn Mercedes 906 LAG engine has been optimized properly calibrating ECU engine maps regarding both ignition advance and air to fuel ratio (AFR). It was therefore possible to correct ignition advance to take into account the faster combustion speed given by the hydrogen content of the fuel mixture. Equivalence ratio (Lambda) has instead been modified in order to minimize the NOx emissions. All the tests were performed on a steady engine test-bed focusing the attention on the most important parts of the engine maps. The target of the activity was the reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions, still catching targets on pollutant emissions to getting the homologation of the engine in the same environmental category of the original one. Experimental results showed a reduction of CO2 variable with the ignition advance: decreasing the ignition advance timing the advantages are reduced. A reduction of CO2 of about 9% can be observed, for the same overall levels of pollutant emissions. After the calibration procedure the engine has been object of formal EU homologation and is running on a city bus since the start of 2013.

The PES scheme under investigation is a form of eco-certification of biodiversity-friendly rubber agroforests, as an economic incentive to keep rubber agroforests from conversion into monoculture plantations. Within the model, we integrated the concept of PES conditionality, where biodiversity performance measures were set for household agents to qualify for incentives. On the other hand, species richness, carbon sequestration, and natural succession sub-models are imbedded in the landscape agents. During the simulation, we looked at three different price scenarios to determine how they will affect the land-use decision of the agents and the ecosystem services supply. The main results showed that PES for rubber agroforests could offer synergies among carbon emission reduction, biodiversity and livelihoods when compared to the existing land-use practices. At the same time, the scheme could reduce the trade-offs resulting from possible land-use/cover change. The results of the simulation were validated using a role-playing game testing responses to external agents. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Agent-based model; Biodiversity performance indicator; Conditionality; Eco-certification; Ecosystem service trade-offs; Land-use/cover change; Price effect","Autonomous agents; Biodiversity; Carbon; Commerce; Computational methods; Conservation; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Forestry; Land use; Operations research; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Conditionality; Eco-certification; Land use/cover change; Performance indicators; Price effect; Trade off; Ecosystems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907309622

Traditional measurements involve direct sampling of the gases in pre-evacuated Giggenbach glass bottles before laboratory chemical analysis. Gas component analysis, combined with the isotope ratios of certain components (e.g., CO2, He), provides insight into the proportion of magmatic, crustal, meteoric and atmospheric components in the fluid, and the state of equilibrium and temperature of these fluids at depth. The Multi-component Gas Analyzing System (MultiGAS) was developed by the volcanological community over 10 years ago as a field-portable instrument for in-situ analysis of the major volcanic gas components in diffuse and dilute gas emissions. No two instruments are identical but all consist of various sensor types now capable of simultaneously analyzing for H2O, CO2, CO, SO2 and H2S. In geothermal systems, surface manifestations are often comprised of gas emissions. In some cases, low temperatures and/or low flow rates make traditional sampling of fiimaroles difficult, due to rapid vapor condensation (in water-rich fiimaroles) and atmospheric contamination. The MultiGAS is best suited to these types of manifestations, providing a tool that can be used at a wide variety of locations with differing gas emission styles. The MultiGAS has been field-tested in two very different geothermal prospect areas: one characterized by cold, CO2-rich gas seeps and bubbling springs, and the other characterized by steaming ground and fiimaroles with temperatures near the boiling point of water. Results of the MultiGAS analysis are compared with the equivalent ratios obtained from traditional sampling and analytical procedures (where possible), in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages of this new technique. The MultiGAS allows for the rapid characterization of the gas geochemistry in the field, aids in mapping/targeting of fumaroles in a large field, and allows for the selection of the most ideal fumaroles to sample using the traditional Giggenbach method.","Exploration; Gas emissions; Gas geochemistry; Italy; MultiGAS; Peru; Real-time","Gas geochemistry; Italy; MultiGAS; Peru; Real-time; Atmospheric chemistry; Bubble formation; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Geothermal fields; Geothermal prospecting; Geothermal springs; Geothermal wells; Glass bottles; Isotopes; Natural resources exploration; Sulfur dioxide; Vapors; Atmospheric temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897632613

Specific rules on this subject (European Council Directive 2008/50/EC) are being developed to reduce potential adverse effects on human health caused by air pollution. In this paper, we describe an air quality assessment in terms of atmospheric particle levels (PMlO), as outlined by European Union legislation and carried out in an industrial coastal area in Spain over an eleven-year period. Its purpose was to compare particle levels there and in other areas of the Mediterranean Basin with levels in Northern Europe that have different meteorological conditions. The study area is in the province of Castellón, a province that is strategic within the framework for European Union (EU) pollution control. Approximately 80% of European ceramic tile and ceramic frit manufacturers are concentrated in two areas that form the so-called ""ceramics clusters""; ones in Modena (Italy) and the other in Castellón. This industry produces many air pollutants in these areas, which make fulfilling European PMlO limits difficult, and so controlling the air quality within them becomes necessary. In the study period, there were two important reductions in PMlO values; the first occurred from 2002 to 2004 due to an agreement by the ceramic industry to implement corrective measures in their production processes; the second reduction, from 2009 onwards, is due to the present economic crisis. A PM10 Air Quality Index has been established to determine the quality of breathed air with ease and clarity. Furthermore, in accordance with Directive 2008/50/EC, an Air Quality Plan is proposed to protect human health and the environment as a whole within the study area. General and specific corrective measures for main emission sources are provided. A strategy for air pollution management is thus presented. © b PSP.","Air pollution; Air quality plan; Ceramic cluster; PM10; Quality index","air quality; atmospheric pollution; European Union; industrial location; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution monitoring; public health; Castellon; Comunidad Valencia; Emilia-Romagna; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Modena; Northern Europe; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876062315

Exhaustive research has been carried out globally to evaluate the suitability of variety of renewable fuels for internal combustion engine applications. Amongst them, vegetable oil methyl esters or biodiesel seem to be a promising alternative for diesel in vital sectors such as transportation, industrial and rural agriculture. For quite some time, the focus for production of biodiesel has shifted towards non-edible oil feedstock from the edible ones, mostly due to food security issues. One such non-edible oil, locally known as Mahua in Indian subcontinent, is a very promising feed stock for biodiesel production. In the present investigation, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% (v/v %) blends of mahua oil methyl ester (MOME) and diesel were prepared. Results of engine trial suggest that the full load brake thermal efficiency was increased by a range of 3.9-23% as compared to diesel baseline. Similarly full load brake specific energy consumption was found to decline with increase in MOME composition in the blend. CO emission was insignificant at part loads for all the blends, however, at full load, blends of MOME showed reduction in CO emission. Emissions of HC were reduced with increase in MOME percentage in the blend confirming better combustion due to the oxygenated fuel. Smoke opacity was also found to decrease with increase in MOME concentration in the blend. However, a marginal increase in NOx was obtained with higher blends.

This is due to the fact that countries with an open economy are active players in international trade. Trade is not only a major factor in forging a country's economic structure, but contributes to the movement of embodied emissions beyond country borders. This issue is especially relevant from the carbon accounting policy and domestic production perspective, as it is known that the production-based principle is employed in the Kyoto agreement. The research described herein was designed to reveal the interdependence of countries on international trade and the corresponding embodied emissions both on national and on sectoral level and to illustrate the significance of the consumption-based emission accounting. It is presented here to what extent a consumption-based accounting would change the present system based on production-based accounting and allocation. The relationship of CO 2 emission embodied in exports and embodied in imports is analysed here. International trade can blur the responsibility for the ecological effects of production and consumption and it can lengthen the link between consumption and its consequences. Input-output models are used in the methodology as they provide an appropriate framework for climate change accounting. The analysis comprises an international comparative study of four European countries (Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Hungary) with extended trading activities and carbon emissions. Moving from a production-based approach in climate policy to a consumption-based principle and allocation approach would help to increase the efficiency of emission reductions and would force countries to rethink their trading activities in order to decrease the environmental load of production activities. The results of this study show that it is important to distinguish between the two emission accounting approaches, both on the global and the local level. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, mineral fertilization is widely used to improve the quality and quantity of seeds. In this study, we conducted field experiments to determine the impact of nitrogen fertilization on B. napus pests, their parasitoids and plant diseases. The results showed that N treatment had an impact on the abundance of pollen beetles (Meligethes aeneus Fab.) and cabbage seed weevils (Ceutorhynchus obstrictus Marsh.) as well as dark spot disease (Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc.). Since pest abundance was not correlated with the flower and silique numbers, the feeding and oviposition sites, plant smell bouquets were analysed to determine potentially attractive or repellent volatile organic compounds. We detected 19 different compounds among which acetic acid and several lipoxygenase pathway products were emitted at higher levels from N-treated plants. Emission of a few other terpenoid compounds was correlated with the pest abundance in field conditions. Abundance of parasitoids of both pests was related to the host availability rather than to the fertilization treatment. Therefore, we suggest that plant chemical cues play a minor role in localization of hosts in close proximity to parasitoid. Dark spot disease levels decreased with increasing N availability, possibly reflecting enhanced emissions of acetic acid, a known antifungal volatile. This study demonstrates the effects of N fertilization on bud and flower volatile bouquets, which might play a role in B. napus insect pest host selection and in resistance to fungal plant diseases. Further studies are necessary to investigate the behavioural responses of insects to the changed volatile bouquets. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Alternaria brassicae; Ceutorhynchus obstrictus; Meligethes aeneus; N fertilization; VOC emission; Winter oilseed rape","acetic acid; antimicrobial activity; beetle; behavioral response; biogenic emission; chemical cue; crop plant; crop yield; disease incidence; disease resistance; enzyme activity; experimental study; fertilizer application; fungal disease; host selection; insect; nutrient availability; oviposition; parasitoid; pest species; seed production; volatile organic compound; Alternaria; Alternaria brassicae; Brassica napus; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Bruchinae; Ceutorhynchus obstrictus; Coleoptera; Hexapoda; Meligethes; Meligethes aeneus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867740252

The latter creates a paradox, from one side we have the satisfaction of the energy demand, in other hand we create a problem that in long term could be worst, for example the contamination of the soil, air and water by the use of toxic products (petroleum, carbon, uranium, etc.) in order to satisfy the growing demand. In that way the microbial fuel cells, try to solve both problems at the same time, generating electrical energy by oxidation of waste water and treat it in the process, reducing the organic loading (8). However, this technology is far from be perfect, because of the low power generation, that is not near to satisfy the actual energy demand.

Elevated deposition of inorganic nitrogen (N) to temperate forest ecosystems has been shown to reduce CH4 uptake in forest soils, but almost no information exists from tropical forest soils even though projections show that N deposition will increase substantially in tropical regions. Here we report the results from two long-term, ecosystem-scale experiments in which we assessed the impact of chronic N addition on soil CH4 fluxes from two old-growth forests in Panama: (1) a lowland, moist (2.7 m yr-1 rainfall) forest on clayey Cambisol and Nitisol soils with controls and N-addition plots for 9-12 yr, and (2) a montane, wet (5.5 m yr-1 rainfall) forest on a sandy loam Andosol soil with controls and N-addition plots for 1&ndash;4 yr. We measured soil CH4 fluxes for 4 yr (2006-2009) in four replicate plots (40 m × 40 m each) per treatment using vented static chambers (four chambers per plot). CH4 fluxes from the lowland control plots and the montane control plots did not differ from their respective N-addition plots. In the lowland forest, chronic N addition did not lead to inhibition of CH4 uptake; instead, a negative correlation of CH4 fluxes with nitrate (NO3&ndash;) concentrations in the mineral soil suggests that increased NO3&ndash; levels in N-addition plots had stimulated CH4 consumption and/or reduced CH4 production. In the montane forest, chronic N addition also showed negative correlation of CH4 fluxes with ammonium concentrations in the organic layer, which suggests that CH4 consumption was N limited. We propose the following reasons why such N-stimulated CH4 consumption did not lead to statistically significant CH4 uptake: (1) for the lowland forest, this was caused by limitation of CH4 diffusion from the atmosphere into the clayey soils, particularly during the wet season, as indicated by the strong positive correlations between CH4 fluxes and water-filled pore space (WFPS); (2) for the montane forest, this was caused by the high WFPS in the mineral soil throughout the year, which may not only limit CH4 diffusion from the atmosphere into the soil but also favour CH4 production; and (3) both forest soils showed large spatial and temporal variations of CH4 fluxes. We conclude that in these extremely different tropical forest ecosystems there were indications of N limitation on CH4 uptake. Based on these findings, it is unlikely that elevated N deposition on tropical forest soils will lead to a rapid reduction of CH4 uptake. © 2013 Author(s).",,"air-soil interaction; Andosol; biogeochemistry; clay soil; forest soil; methane; nitrogen; old-growth forest; source-sink dynamics; temperate forest; tropical forest; Panama [Central America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881536017

Vegetation can potentially have an important role in reducing the CO2 emitted by anthropogenic activities in cities, particularly when vegetation is extensive and/or evergreen. A direct and accurate estimation of carbon uptake by urban vegetation is difficult due to the particular characteristics of the urban ecosystem and high variability in tree distribution and species. Here, we investigate the role of urban vegetation in the CO2 flux from a residential neighbourhood in Singapore using two different approaches. CO2 fluxes measured directly by eddy covariance are compared with emissions estimated from emissions factors and activity data. The latter includes contributions from vehicular traffic, household combustion, soil respiration and human breathing. The difference between estimated emissions and measured fluxes should approximate the flux associated with the aboveground vegetation. In addition, a tree survey was conducted to estimate the annual CO2 sequestration using allometric equations and an alternative model of the metabolic theory of ecology for tropical forests. Palm trees, banana plants and turfgrass were also included in the survey with their annual CO2 uptake obtained from published growth rates. Both approaches agree within 2% and suggest that vegetation sequesters 8% of the total emitted CO2 in the residential neighbourhood studied. An uptake of 1.4 ton km-2 day-1 (510 ton km-2 yr-1) was estimated as the difference between assimilation by photosynthesis minus the aboveground biomass respiration during daytime (4.0 ton km-2 day-1) and release by plant respiration at night (2.6 ton km-2 day-1). However, when soil respiration is added to the daily aboveground flux, the biogenic component becomes a net source amounting to 4% of the total CO2 flux and represents the total contribution of urban vegetation to the carbon flux to the atmosphere. © Author(s) 2013.",,"aboveground biomass; atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; eddy covariance; forest ecosystem; growth rate; human activity; neighborhood; urban ecosystem; vegetation; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886895175

Hydraulic fracture stimulation is a key technology to access multiple reservoir layers and thereby maximize recovery. However, fracture propagation in low porosity carbonates may be strongly confined because of high tensile strengths in bounding layers. The strong confinement can impede vertical fracture propagation and the ability to access reservoir units adjacent to the initiation interval. Understanding vertical hydraulic fracture growth through low porosity layers improves the hydraulic fracture design, enhances reservoir deliverability potential and enables the identification of infill well potential and intervention opportunities. The South Arne field is located in the northern part of the Danish sector of the North Sea. The Tor and Ekofisk formations are high porosity/low permeability chalks with low to moderate natural fracturing. Porosities may reach 45%, but a hard low porosity interval of 10% or less at the bottom of the Ekofisk formation separates and partially compartmentalizes (horizontally) the two formations. A series of indirect tensile strength measurements on South Arne cores were conducted. The measurements verified a suspected exponential increase in tensile strength at low porosities, essentially causing the tensile strength to exceed 1,500 psi in some cases. Recent 4D seismic surveys have enabled separate sweep patterns for each reservoir unit to be mapped and indicate that the sweep is much less efficient in the Ekofisk. This supports that the hydraulic fracture stimulation treatments initiated in the Tor formation are not accessing the upper units to the degree previously assumed and it appears that connection is occurring via pre-existing faults and/or natural fractures. The hydraulic fractures propagate nearly longitudinal to the wellbore, guided by regional stresses, with limited height growth. However, production effects, specifically compaction induced by draw down, may perturb the stress field sufficiently so that the preferred alignment is not achieved, further reducing sweep efficiency. This is indicated by 3D coupled geomechanical modeling and is corroborated by 4D seismic observations. © (2013) by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Exponential increase; Fracture propagation; Geomechanical model; High-tensile strength; Hydraulic fracture design; Hydraulic fracture stimulation; Indirect tensile strength; Strong confinement; Carbonates; Exhibitions; Fracture; Hydraulic fracturing; Offshore oil wells; Porosity; Seismic prospecting; Tensile strength; Petroleum reservoir evaluation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884838162

However, the size, variability, and microbial diversity of these emissions are unknown, despite evidence to suggest they may contribute to allergic responses and infection transmission indoors. This study aimed to evaluate bioaerosol emission from various vacuum cleaners. We sampled the air in an experimental flow tunnel where vacuum cleaners were run, and their airborne emissions were sampled with closed-face cassettes. Dust samples were also collected from the dust bag. Total bacteria, total archaea, Penicillium/Aspergillus, and total Clostridium cluster 1 were quantified with specific quantitative PCR protocols, and emission rates were calculated. Clostridium botulinum and antibiotic resistance genes were detected in each sample using endpoint PCR. Bacterial diversity was also analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), image analysis, and band sequencing. We demonstrated that emission of bacteria and molds (Penicillium/Aspergillus) can reach values as high as 1E5 cell equivalents/min and that those emissions are not related to each other. The bag dust bacterial and mold content was also consistent across the vacuums we assessed, reaching up to 1E7 bacterial or mold cell equivalents/g. Antibiotic resistance genes were detected in several samples. No archaea or C. botulinum was detected in any air samples. Diversity analyses showed that most bacteria are from human sources, in keeping with other recent results.

Soil spatial variability is not easy to map when differences are due to textural changes or chemical properties that affects plant growing and, therefore, its potential yield. In southern Buenos Aires province, Argentina, the main limiting factor for cropping is soil depth, limited by a limestone layer. In that region, soil depth variation is very significant and may vary into the field, from 40 cm up to 1.2 m depth in short distances. Since soil depth determines the soil water storage capacity, most of the years, this factor explains the crop yield spatial variation within the field. However, crop yield spatial variability change from year to year depending on the rainfall amount and frequency. Crop simulation models, such as CERES-wheat are valuable tools to analyze year-to-year- yield variability for different soils and fertilization rates. In the last years, GPS technology made possible to map soil depth at relative low cost, providing valuable information at field scale, to decide crop rotation and crop management practices according to the average soil depth and its variability. This kind of maps allows identifying areas of high and low potential yields, which might require higher and lower amounts of nutrients. In this study, the combination of soil-depth maps with crop simulation models is evaluated as a tool to be used by farmers and advisors to design site specific management strategies. On-farm experiment based on field scale strip-trials were carried out during two years, at two locations, to evaluate crop yields under both uniform and variable fertilization rate of Nitrogen for winter crops. Yield maps records were used to evaluate the differences between variable and uniform fertilization rate, at different soil depths. Nitrogen Fertilization rates were established for 4 soil depth ranges (30 cm; 50 cm ; 80 cm and more than 1 m) according to the demand of nutrients to reach the average maximum yield. Economical benefits of this practice were analyzed, as well as its environmental impact due to available N for leaching and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of both strategies.","Crop simulation models; Greenhouse gas; Site specific management; Variable nitrogen fertilization","Computer simulation; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Soil moisture; Tools; Crop management practices; Crop simulation model; Nitrogen fertilization; Rain fed agriculture; Site specific management; Spatial variability; Variable fertilizations; Variable rate fertilization; Crops",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881624035

A project of a scientific journal, located in a country as Colombia and aimed to contribute in the entirely world as source of first quality information, hand in hand with so many publications in countries with a better development index, its a titanic task which just be earned thanks to all of you, readers, authors, contributors, critics, reviewers, staff workers. Our country currently is planning a new characterization of journals as this one you are reading now. Thanks to our tiredless work now we can warrant to every one of our users than we are going to keep our category as a journal of first quality. But we need your support. As part of our compromise this time we offered important papers in the development of the Earth Sciences which we are completely sure are necessary in the current state of art. Our first article in this number come from the Persian Gulf with an intelligent model based in probabilistic neural networks to produce a quantitative formulation between seismic attributes and hydraulic flow units. Based on the results of this study the exploration success rate and the costs reduction would be improved through the application of more reliable output results in hydrocarbon explorations programs. As it has been traditionally in our journal, an important percentange of the papers are related to hydrogeology studies. From different countries, we present four papers analyzing groundwater potential zonation, psychochemical characteristics, spatio-temporal variability of an aquifer in Iran and nutrients loads in drainage water from a costal irrigated area.

This approach may require the transporting of captured carbon dioxide via pipeline to an underground storage reservoir with the intent of keeping it out of the atmosphere. Congress has begun to address this issue. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140) contains measures to promote research and development of CCS technology, to assess sequestration capacity, and to clarify the framework for issuance of CO2 pipeline rights-of-way on public land. Other legislative proposals have also sought to encourage the development of CO2 sequestration, capture, and transportation technology. Further, measures were introduced in the 110th Congress, including the Carbon Dioxide Pipeline Study Act of 2007 (S. 2144), which would have required the Secretary of Energy to study the feasibility of constructing and operating a network of CO2 pipelines for CCS. Such a network could develop in the future with or without legislative action. If these pipelines were to cross state lines, it could raise important issues concerning regulatory jurisdiction over siting and pricing. This chapter discusses federal jurisdictional uncertainty over CO2 pipelines under existing law, as well as potential legislative activity to address any possible regulatory ""gap"" in jurisdiction. It should be noted that such a potential gap does not necessarily demand federal legislative resolution. Nevertheless, some analysts, drawing on the history of oil and natural gas pipeline development, anticipate a potential need for better defined federal legislative/regulatory authority over an interstate CO2 pipeline network. Accordingly, Congress may be called upon to consider whether existing federal jurisdictional disclaimers and the state-by-state regulatory structure for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) pipelines is an appropriate regulatory scheme for a possible interstate CO2 pipeline network in support of CCS. Congress could amend existing statutes, such as those related to the interstate pipeline jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or the Surface Transportation Board (STB) to provide for definitive CO2 pipeline rate jurisdiction by the federal government if it does not favor the existing regulatory scheme. Alternatively, Congress could establish another federal regulator of CO2 pipelines or possibly other legislation to amend the existing regulatory scheme. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The heat from the superadiabatic region is then extracted and conducted through embedded, high-thermal conductivity radiation corridors and is radiated, at a higher temperature than the flue gas, to the target.

The scientific data, internationally, about such emission from cells, tissues or even entire living systems began approximately 50 years ago recording with modern photomultiplier tubes (PMT). This chapter begins with a historic overview. The concept of systems biology has recently changed the understanding about UPE. Instead of simply measuring intensity, UPE may be a tool to characterize organization of living systems by utilizing photon count distribution analysis. New terminology about UPE and its relation to light information is discussed from different perspectives. The quantitative collection of subtle data is essential for the development of additional diagnostic principles. The reader will learn about the ""Fano factor"" and the ""Squeezed state"" models to read the light language in different ways. Recent data reflecting human photon count statistics have been utilized to compare these models vis-à-vis two independent datasets, correlation and factor analysis. One includes healthy subjects, the other pre-diabetics. This is the beginning of a new database that will be utilized to hopefully discover the significance and correlation of the photon signal with other qualitative and quantitative features of living systems in the field of human health and disease. The data already suggest that UPE measurement provides such an opportunity. Linkage of UPE observations with biochemical (metabolomic) information seems to have great potential.

We investigate the difference in the spatial distribution of the energy input for parameterisations of different mechanisms to heat the corona of the Sun and possible impacts on the coronal emission. Methods. We use a 3D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) model of a solar active region as a reference and compare the Ohmic-type heating in this model to parameterisations for alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) heating models; in particular, we use Alfvén wave and MHD turbulence heating. We extract the quantities needed for these two parameterisations from the reference model and investigate the spatial distribution of the heat input in all three cases, globally and along individual field lines. To study differences in the resulting coronal emission, we employ 1D loop models with a prescribed heat input based on the heating rate we extracted along a bundle of field lines. Results. On average, all heating implementations show a rough drop of the heating rate with height. This also holds for individual field lines. While all mechanisms show a concentration of the energy input towards the low parts of the atmosphere, for individual field lines the concentration towards the foot points is much stronger for the DC mechanisms than for the Alfvén wave AC case. In contrast, the AC model gives a stronger concentration of the emission towards the foot points. This is because the more homogeneous distribution of the energy input leads to higher coronal temperatures and a more extended transition region. Conclusions. The significant difference in the concentration of the heat input towards the foot points for the AC and DC mechanisms and the pointed difference in the spatial distribution of the coronal emission for these cases show that the two mechanisms should be discriminable by observations. Before drawing final conclusions, these parameterisations should be implemented in new 3D models in a more self-consistent way. © 2013 ESO.","Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); Methods: numerical; Stars: coronae; Sun: corona","Coronal temperatures; Different mechanisms; Homogeneous distribution; Methods: numericals; Significant differences; Solar active regions; Stars: coronae; Sun : corona; Heating; Heating rate; Magnetohydrodynamics; Numerical methods; Solar energy; Spatial distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878627725

The most basic consideration for any hull coating is the protection of the hull against corrosion. This includes, to an increasing degree, passenger ships sailing in ice and polar regions. Fuel economy is an environmental concern as well as a financial one, because greater fuel efficiency equates to reduction of GHG and other atmospheric emissions. It is also an economic concern with bunker prices high and rising. The fuel efficiency of the hull depends on its being smooth over the life of the ship and on its being kept free of fouling. Choice of hull coatings must consider the environmental effect of the emission of toxic substances such as heavy metals, biocides, silicone oils or other chemicals into the water column and sediment, and also directly onto ice in icebound regions. There is also the matter of hull-borne aquatic invasive species and their threat to biodiversity, which is of increasing concern internationally. This paper compares the various options for underwater hull coatings for passenger ships and focuses on an innovative, environmentally-friendly, economically-viable alternative to the hull coating systems in general use on the world fleet today, highlighting the specific application of a surface treated composite (STC). The paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each coating type, specifically on passenger ships, featuring as a case study a major cruise line which successfully converted from a biocidal antifouling coating to an STC which has been in use on all of its ships for the last eight years. © 2013: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",,"Antifouling paint; Biocides; Biodiversity; Coatings; Composite coatings; Costs; Economics; Efficiency; Environmental impact; Fleet operations; Fuel economy; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; Heavy metals; Ships; Silicone coatings; Silicones; Transportation; Underwater acoustics; Antifouling coating; Aquatic invasive species; Atmospheric emission; Economic concerns; Economically viable; Environmental concerns; Maintenance cost; Toxic substances; Hulls (ship)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942023386

In this work, we construct a general ES resource (ESR) model, which encompasses DRRs as a special case and explicitly represents the physical and economic attributes of integrated grid-scale ES and DRRs and aggregations of smaller-scale ES and DRRs. We deploy this model in a market simulation framework to perform a systematic side-by-side comparison of the economic and emission impacts of ES and DRRs in networks operated/controlled by an independent system operator/regional transmission organization and in its associated day-ahead markets. This analysis points out the limits to the penetrations below which an added MW of ES or DRR no longer brings about decreases in buyer payments and that the benefits that accrue to DRRs are disproportionately larger than the benefits to buyers and ESRs. Further, we find that ES and DRRs have little impact on reducing system-wide emissions. In fact, we find that their utilization may even result in emission increases in some cases. These findings provide insights into nature of the ES and DRR market impacts which are useful for grid stakeholders interested in the integration of appropriate penetrations of such resources. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Comparative assessment; Day ahead market; Demand response resources; Environmental concerns; Independent system operators; Market simulation; Power system economics; Storage resources; Commerce; Electric power distribution; Energy storage; Optimization; System theory; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890475559

Methane fluxes from lake ecosystems have increasingly been studied, yet only few reconstructions of past methane emissions from lakes are available. In this study,we develop an approach to assess changes in methane availability in lakes based on δ13c of chitinous invertebrate remains and apply this to a sediment record from a Siberian thermokarst lake. Diffusive methane fluxes from the surface of ten newly sampled Siberian lakes and seven previously studied Swedish lakes were compared to taxon-specific δ13c values of invertebrate remains from lake surface sediments to investigate whether these invertebrates assimilated 13C-depleted carbon typical for methane. Remains of chironomid larvae of the tribe Orthocladiinae that, in the study lakes, mainly assimilate plant-derived carbon had higher δ13c than other invertebrate groups. δ13c of other invertebrates such as several chironomid groups (Chironomus, Chironomini, Tanytarsini, and Tanypodinae), cladocerans (Daphnia), and ostracods were generally lower. δ13c of Chironomini and Daphnia, and to a lesser extent Tanytarsini was variable in the lakes and lower at sites with higher diffusive methane fluxes. δ13c of Chironomini, Tanytarsini, and Daphnia were correlated significantly with diffusive methane flux in the combined Siberian and Swedish dataset (r1=-0.72, p = 0.001, r = 0.53, p = 0.03, and r1\4;0.81, p &lt; 0.001, respectively), suggesting that δ13c in these invertebrates was affected by methane availability. In a second step, we measured δ13c of invertebrate remains from a sediment record of Lake S1, a shallow thermokarst lake in northeast Siberia. In this record, covering the past ca 1000 years, δ13c of taxa most sensitive to methane availability (Chironomini, Tanytarsini, and Daphnia) was lowest in sediments deposited from ca AD 1250 to ca AD 1500, and after AD 1970, coinciding with warmer climate as indicated by an independent local temperature record. As a consequence the offset in δ13c between methane-sensitive taxa and bulk organic matterwas higher in these sections than in other parts of the core. In contrast, δ13c of other invertebrate taxa did not show this trend. Our results suggest higher methane availability in the study lake during warmer periods and that thermokarst lakes can respond dynamically in their methane output to changing environmental conditions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Chironomids; Chitinous remains; Invertebrates; Lake sediment; Methane; Stable carbon isotopes","Animals; Climatology; Ecosystems; Lakes; Sediments; Chironomids; Chitinous remains; Invertebrates; Lake sediments; Stable carbon isotopes; Methane; carbon isotope; chitin; environmental conditions; fossil record; invertebrate; lacustrine deposit; larva; methane; paleoenvironment; reconstruction; stable isotope; thermokarst; Siberia; Sweden; Chironomidae; Chironomini; Daphnia; Invertebrata; Orthocladiinae; Ostracoda; Tanypodinae; Tanytarsini",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881372403

Interest in the application of this technology throughout the Asia-Pacific region is growing, as end- users, engineers, and architects increase their environmental awareness and as some jurisdictions introduce a carbon tax or carbon pricing policy. Vic- Roads, the roads authority of the state of Victoria in Australia, is a signature specifier that has already changed its specification for non-structural concrete to accommodate geopolymer concrete. In addition, progress has been made in a RILEM Technical Committee to establish a framework for a performance standard for alkali-activated concrete. The commercialization of geopolymer technology is linked closely with scientific developments in this area, in particular through the use of innovative methods to analyze and predict durability and in understanding and controlling reaction mechanisms. The importance of leading-edge scientific research in enhancing the performance and utility of geopolymer concretes is also highlighted, with the identification of some of the remaining technical and non-technical hurdles that must be overcome. This paper outlines the process of commercializing an alternative binder system at the production scale, including obtaining regulatory approval for groundbreaking applications in civil infrastructure. There has been much discussion of the potential of alkali-activation technology over the past decades, but until now, large-scale application has been limited. Some of the reasons for this slow progress, as well as the methods by which obstacles have been overcome, are discussed.

Coordinates of the top-100 individual LPS in Europe were taken from the TNO point source database and corresponding OMI S2 plots (ca. 100 × 100 km) were made. From the top-10 emitters in the LPS database, only ca. 50% was clearly identifiable. To interpret this surprising mismatch we compiled corresponding OMI N2 plots and investigated these on a plant by plant basis. This supported various improvements in the representation of LPS in the TNO-MACC emission inventory used in the GMES Atmospheric Core Service. Some plants had shifted from coal to gas and were no longer (large) S2 emitters but could be clearly identified in the OMI N2 retrievals. In some cases the coordinates of the LPS were incorrect or allocation of emission to a LPS within the country was incorrect. In the latter case, the national S2 emission was maintained but the location of emission should be adjusted. It was previously demonstrated that individual sources (or multiple sources within 50 km) with annual S2 emissions greater than about 70 kT y-1 produce a statistically significant signal in 5-year averaged OMI data. When we used this threshold to verify the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) reported emissions, most plants with emissions larger than 50-70 kT y-1 could be identified. Thus the use of OMI S2 retrievals is a promising tool for monitoring and identification of LPS emissions, especially in regions were high quality emission data is missing. However, we also established that in the case of Europe LPS only account for 25-30% of the total annual S2 emission. Combining the traditional emission inventory approach with novel satellite retrieval interpretations provides added value, which may increase when satellite data with a better sensitivity to S2 become available. ©2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.

The livestock contributes with 37% of global CH4 emission. The sources of GHG (CO2 and CH4) are the liquid manure or slurry storage and the compact solid manure. Measurement systems of GHG emission are important for the selection of the appropriate technology. By using the closed chamber method for soil, landfills, volcanoes etc., the present study evaluates the estimation of total emissions of methane and carbon dioxide from an experimental farm in Cluj County, Romania. The investigated area covered with sheep solid manure was about 579 m2 and ~5 cm thick, for cattle was about 12 m2 and 5 m thick and for swine was about 1.5 m5 and 0.5 m thick. The total methane emission measured for sheep manure was 0.83 t CH4/year and for cattle manure was 0.185 t CH4/year. The total carbon dioxide emission measured for sheep manure was 61.3 t CO2/year and for cattle manure was 4.7 t CO2/year. The measurement for pigs manure was high and this could be due to the freshness of the manure. The estimated emissions showed that a considerable amount of CH4 and CO2 is produced also by an experimental farm and an appropriate management of manure is important for reducing greenhouse gas. In this respect, we believe that the future solution for a green economy is to use manure in biogas plants.","Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gas emissions; Manure; Methane",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891142043

The C(Mo2C) carbon supports with variable specific surface area, microporosity-mesoporosity, good electrical conductivity and corrosion stability at positive potentials were prepared from Mo2C at 600 °C and 800 °C using chlorination synthesis method. Pt-nanoclusters were deposited onto/into carbons using sodium borohydride reduction method. XRD, XRF, XPS, SEM-EDX, and HRTEM data confirm that catalysts under study are free from chlorine, chloride ions, and other residuals of raw materials, and have highly porous hierarchical structure with homogenously dispersed Pt-nanoclusters. RDE data show that the kinetic current densities are higher and half-wave potentials are more positive for Pt-C(Mo 2C)800 °C than for Pt-C(Mo2C)600 °C in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The limiting diffusion currents are independent of the catalyst composition used due to the proceeding of ORR process in the outer-diffusion mode. Analysis of impedance data demonstrated nearly capacitive behaviour in low ac frequency region, explained by quick cathodic electroreduction of oxygen followed by slow electrical double-layer formation step limited by adsorption of ions and intermediates at/inside microporous-mesoporous C(Mo2C) and Pt-nanocluster modified electrodes. High series and parallel capacitance values (100-250 F g -1) have been established, attractive also for hybrid supercapacitor applications.

The automotive industry is placing high importance on CO2 reduction technologies. Using Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery pack Stop & Start (S&S) system with combined energy regeneration is an effective technology to reduce CO2 emissions. Power supply storage is very important for the S&S system. High charging acceptance, low weight, and compact size are required. A Li-ion battery is the optimal power supply that meets these requirements. It has high charge acceptance per weight. Furthermore, we developed simple system structure which eliminates the need for the DC-DC converter. By utilizing a Li-ion battery that has voltage characteristics similar to the Pb battery there is no need for a converter to make adjustments between the two power supplies. The Li-ion battery's range of capacity must be managed appropriately as overcharge and overdischarge causes extensive damage to the battery. Therefore, battery State of Charge (SOC) is very important. We considered a method which detects open circuit voltage (OCV) while driving. The S&S system has a stable electric discharge area for a long time. The battery condition is stable in the area. By measuring in this area, and considering the frequency characteristic of the impedance of a battery, it becomes easier to detect SOC correctly even if the current sensor has an error.

The isoprene production is calculated as a function of electron transport-limited photosynthesis, intercellular and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and canopy temperature. The vegetation biophysics module computes the photosynthetic uptake of carbon dioxide coupled with the transpiration of water vapor and the isoprene emission rate at the 30 min physical integration time step of the global chemistry-climate model. In the model, the rate of carbon assimilation provides the dominant control on isoprene emission variability over canopy temperature. A control simulation representative of the present-day climatic state that uses 8 plant functional types (PFTs), prescribed phenology and generic PFT-specific isoprene emission potentials (fraction of electrons available for isoprene synthesis) reproduces 50% of the variability across different ecosystems and seasons in a global database of 28 measured campaign-average fluxes. Compared to time-varying isoprene flux measurements at 9 select sites, the model authentically captures the observed variability in the 30 min average diurnal cycle (R2 = 64-96 %) and simulates the flux magnitude to within a factor of 2. The control run yields a global isoprene source strength of 451 TgC yr?1 that increases by 30% in the artificial absence of plant water stress and by 55% for potential natural vegetation. © Author(s) 2013.",,"atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; emission; isoprene; photosynthesis; stomatal conductance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886260611

Despite advances in seasonal forecasting since the late 1990s, there is hardly any evidence of explicit use of forecasts by vulnerable smallholder farmers to manage climate-related risk in agriculture. Forecasts are presented in the language of probabilities, but are often not perceived as such, partly because of differences in end users' needs and their decision-making behaviour. The project used the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) index and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to develop a tailored seasonal forecast model termed the 'binary' or 'drought/no drought'. The binary forecast model addresses farmers most important question: what is the probability of drought (SPI ≤-1) occurring in the crop growing season? The 'binary' forecast system allowed the development of climate risk management strategies specifically tailored to farmers' needs. From this study, it can be concluded that rainfed agriculture production systems are most concerned about the risk of drought. A tailored forecast system that provides information on the probability of drought occurring in a given season can therefore lead to proactive drought risk management among smallholder farmers and policy-makers. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","binary forecast; drought; ENSO; IOD; tailored seasonal climate forecast","annual variation; climate prediction; decision making; drought; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; farmers knowledge; farming system; forecasting method; rainfed agriculture; risk assessment; semiarid region; smallholder; Zimbabwe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879629887

The process efficiency was characterized in terms of reduction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), colour and absorbance at 254 nm (A 254), and the improvement of biodegradability. The reduction of colour and A254 was significantly greater than for DOC and COD for all samples due to the greater breakdown of humic compounds, as confirmed by fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra. Fairly small differences in the reduction of DOC (26-38%) and COD (25-37%) were observed for all samples, suggesting that the salinity of the ROC did not have a significant impact on the UVC/H2O2 treatment under the test conditions. The biodegradability of the treated ROC samples improved markedly (approximately 2-fold) after 60 min UVC/H2O2 treatment.

The mineral carbonization as a method to lower the reduction of CO2 is especially interesting while using the waste. The article presents the estimation of lowering the CO2 emission in the power industry with the use of water suspensions of energy waste. The results of researches on the level of CO2 absorption by the waste-water suspension and emission from coal burning in the energy industry were used to conduct the estimation. Only the wastes which do not need the pre-treatment but have the potential to bind CO2 were taken into consideration, that means: fly ash from the conventional boilers, ash from fluidal boilers, mixtures of ash and desulphurization products, fly ash from co-combustion of coal and bio-mass and waste from half-dry method of desulphurization. It was assumed that the sequestration may be conducted with the use of waste used in mining and waste which are commercially unexploited.

This study observed the behavior of liquid CO2 injected into water-saturated Berea sandstone by using microfocus X-ray computed tomography with high spatial resolution. The three-dimensional CO2 distribution in the sample was clearly reconstructed. The bedding structure of the rock strongly determined the CO2 permeation process, and a strong correlation was seen between the local porosity of the sample and the CO2 saturation. The real time CO2 permeation process was also observed in the transparent images that showed the CO2 gradually permeating the rock in the axial direction with increased saturation in the higher porosity beddings.

The built-infrastructure of densely populated cities and intercity travel by passenger and freight traffic lead to significant adverse impacts of traffic congestion on air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and global warming. Transportation contributes 28% of energy related greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. This paper shows that traffic related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are higher per capita for several rural and smaller cities compared to large urban areas in the United States. Inadequate use of mass transit, urban sprawl, construction of more roads and traditional stop-controlled intersections, and addition of more lanes to increase traffic capacity and ease congestion, are primary causes of significant vehicle emission inventory of CO2 and air quality degradation. It is shown that sustainable traffic management policies, such as reduction of work-related travel by cars and more use of mass transit modes, can decrease CO2 emissions.

It is due to the use of low strength concrete for construction as well as poor quality control of materials during construction. A high carbonation rate of concrete is expected for concrete structures in Bangladesh that leads to corrosion over the steel bars in concrete in a short period of service life and subsequently results in early deterioration of concrete structures. No detailed studies have been conducted to estimate carbonation of concrete in Bangladesh. Therefore, this study has been planned to determine carbonation rate of concrete structures in Dhaka city. For evaluation of carbonation depth in structural elements, such as beam, slab, and columns of real structures seventy buildings from Dhaka city were selected for investigation. The age of the structures was varied from 1 year to 79 years. Based on the relationship between carbonation depth and age of the structures, carbonation coefficient was determined for different structural elements. More carbonation depth was found in outdoor exposure condition compared to the indoor exposure condition. More carbonation rate was also found for slab compared to beams and columns. © 2013 Sustainable Construction Materials and Technologies.

Jessup International Moot Court, United States","The paper argues that an effective legal framework for oil and gas exploration and exploitation must address two principal concerns: delimitation of international boundaries and rules for developing fields that may be under two or more States' territories. Delimitation should not cause major concerns because the majority of Arctic oil and gas resources lie either within a single State's sovereign land or cross already delimited boundaries. Remaining boundaries can be delimited based on well-established principles. The economic and political pressures impelling oil and gas production have ensured that States focus on delineating the outer limits of their continental shelf; naturally, this will lead States without delimited boundaries to focus on establishing maritime boundaries with neighboring States. As for cross-boundary hydrocarbon-resource exploitation, the set of rules were sparse until the 2010 Barents Sea Agreement between Norway and Russia, which represents thestate-of-the-art bilateral treaty that will effectively address cross-border hydrocarbon-field exploitation. This approach is expected to be preferred by the Arctic States for other boundaries. In addition to the 2010 Barents Sea Agreement, other useful practices at a finer level of detail will likely also form precedent for future bilateral treaties. Unitization agreements and Joint Operating Agreements, including those among private parties, will provide the finer details of field-level treaties or protocols.

This dispersal of hipparions into the Old World represents a major faunal event during the Neogene. The reasons for this fast dispersal of H. primigenium within Europe are still unclear. Based on its hypsodonty, a high specialization in grazing is assumed although the feeding ecology of the earliest European hipparionines within a pure C3 plant ecosystem remains to be investigated. A multi-proxy approach, combining carbon and oxygen isotopes from enamel as well as dental meso- and microwear analyses of cheek teeth, was used to characterize the diet of the earliest European H. primigenium populations from four early Late Miocene localities in Germany (Eppelsheim, Höwenegg), Switzerland (Charmoille), and France (Soblay). Enamel δ(13)C values indicate a pure C3 plant diet with small (<1.4‰) seasonal variations for all four H. primigenium populations. Dental wear and carbon isotope compositions are compatible with dietary differences. Except for the Höwenegg hipparionines, dental microwear data indicate a browse-dominated diet. By contrast, the tooth mesowear patterns of all populations range from low to high abrasion suggesting a wide spectrum of food resources. Combined dental wear and stable isotope analysis enables refined palaeodietary reconstructions in C3 ecosystems. Different H. primigenium populations in Europe had a large spectrum of feeding habits with a high browsing component. The combination of specialized phenotypes such as hypsodont cheek teeth with a wide spectrum of diet illustrates a new example of the Liem's paradox. This dietary flexibility associated with the capability to exploit abrasive food such as grasses probably contributed to the rapid dispersal of hipparionines from North America into Eurasia and the fast replacement of the brachydont equid Anchitherium by the hypsodont H. primigenium in Europe.",,"carbon; oxygen; animal; animal dispersal; article; chemistry; diet; ecosystem; enamel; Equidae; Europe; feeding behavior; fossil; herbivory; histology; North America; phylogeography; physiology; Poaceae; species extinction; tooth; tooth disease; Animal Distribution; Animals; Carbon Isotopes; Dental Enamel; Diet; Ecosystem; Equidae; Europe; Extinction, Biological; Food Habits; Fossils; Herbivory; North America; Oxygen Isotopes; Phylogeography; Poaceae; Tooth; Tooth Wear",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896389587

In particular, little is known about the transport of contaminants used in the process through the fractured formation. Many of the surfactants used to enable greater water penetration during fracturing can contain toxic chemicals, but the probability of underground water resource contamination by these chemicals has not been widely studied. This is partially due to a lack of modeling tools that can address such a complex engineering problem. This work presents a new computational framework for modeling hydraulic fracturing with the following features: A non-local representation of solid mechanics in which cracks are naturally part of the solution, a locally mass conserving, edge-based finite element model for flow and transport, and a general local-nonlocal coupling that includes loosely and strongly coupled algorithms. This framework is capable of modeling a number of stages during the fracturing process including the initial perforation of the reservoir, the fracture itself, leakoff in the vicinity of the fracture, poroelastic response, damage modified permeability, as well as transport of species through the damaged matrix.

Our modelling results show that critical levels are exceeded in northern Europe for both ozone and nitrogen. Emission reductions will reduce the vegetation stress, but climate change is likely to have an opposite effect. While tropospheric ozone is reduced, its phytotoxic dose increases due to atmospheric warming. The amplified warming in the Arctic may significantly enhance shipping emissions. The effect of these increases extends to the boreal region.

It causes extensive damage to gramineous crops. The climate mapping program, CLIMEX 3.0, and the GIS software, ArcGIS 9.3, were used to model the current and future potential geographical distribution of L. m. tibetensis. The model predicts that, under current climatic conditions, L. m. tibetensis will be able to establish itself throughout much of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China, including Qinghai,Tibet and Sichuan province. A total of 94.23% of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau's land mass or 2.22×106 km2, is climatically suitable under current climatic conditions. In this study, the potential distribution of L. m. tibetensis under future climate scenarios was projected and quantified climatically suitable areas. In Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the total suitable climate land mass was increased by 0.16×106 km2 or 0.70% until 2100. However, compared to 2020 and 2050, the suitable land mass was decreased by 0.47×106 km2 and 0.17×10 6 km2. The most optimal area would increase 0.16 ×106 km2 until 2100, the most of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau would be expected to offer optimal climatic conditions for the possible spread and establishment of the pest. The analysis of this information indicated a high degree of accuracy for the CLIMEX model. The significant increases in the potential distribution of L. m. tibetensis projected under the climate change scenarios considered in this study suggest that biosecurity authorities should consider the effects of climate change when undertaking pest risk assessments. © 2013 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","ArcGIS; climate change; CLIMEX; Locusta migratoria tibetensis Chen; potential geographic distribution","Agriculture; Climate change; Geographic information systems; Geographical distribution; Optimization; ArcGIS; Bio-security; Climate change scenarios; Climatic conditions; CLIMEX; Future climate scenarios; Geographic distribution; GIS software; High degree of accuracy; Land-masses; Locusta migratoria; Potential distributions; Qinghai Tibet plateau; Sichuan province; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874521356

The project, started in 2008, aims at energy saving and global warming prevention with ITS technologies. A platoon of three fully-automated heavy trucks and also a fully-automated light truck currently drives at 80 km/h with the gap of up to 4 m on a test truck and along an expressway before public use, under not only steady state driving but also lane changing. The lateral control is based on the lane marker detection by the computer vision, and the longitudinal control is based on the gap measurement by 76 GHz radar and lidar in addition to the inter-vehicle communications of 5.8 GHz DSRC and infrared. The radar and lidar also work as the obstacle detection. The feature of the technologies is the high reliability, aiming at the near future introduction. Fuel consumption measurement on a test track and along an expressway shows that the fuel can be saved by about 13 % when the gap was 10 m. The evaluation simulation shows that the effectiveness of the platooning with the gap of 10 m when the 40 % penetration in heavy trucks is 2.1 % reduction of CO2 along an expressway.

In order to reduce the domestic GHG emissions by 80-95% -compared to 1990 levels- till 2050, the building sector has to do its part and to pass through a deep restructure. In this frame, the hospitality industry, responsible for 2% of the world's CO2 emissions can play a crucial role contributing to the 2020 energy targets in the Member States. This paper presents the scope and rationale of the European project ""Nearly Zero-Energy Hotels"" (NEZEH). The NEZEH project, co-financed by the European Commission aims to reinforce businesses operating in the hospitality sector to meet the challenges of competitiveness, reduction of energy consumption and adoption of green energy technologies, providing technical support and advice to selected hotels in order to develop sustainable and feasible large scale renovations towards Near Zero Energy consumption levels. The project covers six (6) Southern European countries - Spain, Greece, Italy, Romania, Croatia and France -locally and nationally. This need becomes more urgent as European law (Energy Performance of Building Directive recast) requires that -by 2020- all new buildings will be zero energy consumption (NZEB). However, the concept of NZEB is still not well developed in most EU countries and Member States should adopt specific policies and measures to accelerate the rate of large scale refurbishments of existing buildings. © 2013 The Authors.

China is the fastest growing major economy in the world, and is following a process of rapid industrialization. This process, however, contributes dramatically to global warming through major CO2 emissions. The widespread provision of electricity through coal-fired power plants is just one contributor, but industrial structures, transportation systems, and the construction of large superblock residential towers also play major roles. The large cities and industrialized provinces of China emit the most CO2, a fact that requires serious attention. However, stemming this trend elsewhere in China would provide a greater opportunity for success in reducing overall CO2 emissions in the country. Consequently, the question this paper addresses is what policies can be adopted to reduce CO2 emissions in provinces in China where development is still in its early stages, while maintaining economic growth. Jiangxi is a province that has historically been a major agricultural area. In recent years, however, because of the economic development policies of the Chinese central government, the province's rich mineral deposits, favorable location, and convenient transportation system are attracting more investments and projects for development (Statistical Bureau of Jiangxi, 2010). Jiangxi, then, provides an excellent case study because the province, although developing quickly, might still produce less CO2 if proper growth policies and actions are implemented. According to the results of this research, CO2 emissions would indeed decline in Jiangxi if the province would adopt new technology for electricity generation and increase the GDP role of the service sector. © 2013 Zhejiang University and Chinese Association of Urban Management","Chinese industrialization; Chinese power production; CO2 emissions in China; economic growth and global warming; Provincial Chinese development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066752339

Then, a system-wide model of the National Airspace System analyzes the resulting schedules and determines pre- and post-tax flight operational performances, specifically average delay. Finally, a model that measures fuel burn and emissions based on flight trajectories is used to estimate the change in environmental impact from schedule adjustments made by the airlines in response to the carbon tax.

This paper presents the results on the simulations of different technology development scenarios under the same emission reduction goal, utilizing the MARKAL model to evaluate emissions reduction on Taiwan's electricity, industry, buildings, and transportation sectors. The empirical results show that Taiwan can potentially reduce 56%-60% of greenhouse gas emissions relative to the BAU scenario in 2025, and 15% relative to the 2005 levels. These projected results are higher than the Kyoto targets of Annex I countries and also higher than those projected in the (IEA, 2011 [17]) and (EIA, 2011 [5]) scenarios. The accumulated incremental cost will be an increase by 1.2%-1.96% of Taiwan's GDP. As Taiwan heavily relies on imported energy from foreign sources and has very limited natural endowments of renewable energy, it is very difficult for Taiwan to reach this reduction goal alone through adopting emission reduction technology, or applying economic incentive mechanism. Allowing Taiwan to participate in the international flexible mechanisms will be a necessary measure for Taiwan to achieve its emission reduction goal; in addition, such participation will also benefit the international community's GHG reduction efforts tremendously. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Greenhouse gas; Incremental cost; Mitigation strategy","Costs; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Global warming; Emissions mitigation; Emissions reduction; Incremental cost; International community; Mitigation strategy; Technology development; Transportation sector; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Greenhouse gases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872361563

The new implementation COSMO-CLM1TEB is used for a 1-yr reanalysis-driven simulation over Europe at a spatial resolution of 0.11° (~12 km) and over the area of Berlin at a spatial resolution of 0.025° (~2.8 km) for evaluating the new coupled model. The results on the coarse spatial resolution of 0.11° show that the standard and the new models provide 2-m temperature and daily precipitation fields that differ only slightly by from -0.1 to +0.2K per season and ±0.1 mm day-1, respectively, with very similar statistical distributions. This indicates only a negligibly small effect of the urban parameterization on the model's climatology. Therefore, it is suggested that an urban parameterization may be omitted in model simulations on this scale. On the spatial resolution of 0.025° the model COSMOCLM1TEB is able to better represent the magnitude of the urban heat island in Berlin than the standard model COSMO-CLM.

We demonstrate that designing such an algorithm instead of applying the state-of-the art general purpose classification techniques is a reasonable choice for the automated sentiment classification in practice. Using RBEM we can design a competitive multilingual sentiment classification system showing promising accuracy results of 78.8% on the considered datasets. We provide some further evidence that RBEM-based systems are easy to debug, improve over time and adapt to new application domains.","Emission model; Multi-lingual sentiment analysis; Rule-based polarity detection","Algorithms; Data mining; Classification technique; Emission model; Language constructs; Rule based; Rule-based approach; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; State of the art; Program debugging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890582026

We therefore studied the effects of CO2 partial pressure (PCO2) (16.2, 39.5, and 101.3 Pa) on growth and photosynthetic carbon acquisition in the bloom-forming species Chaetoceros debilis, Pseudo-nitzschia subcurvata, Fragilariopsis kerguelensis, and Phaeocystis antarctica. Using membrane-inlet mass spectrometry, photosynthetic O2 evolution and inorganic carbon (Ci) fluxes were determined as a function of CO2 concentration. Only the growth of C. debilis was enhanced under high PCO2. Analysis of the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) revealed the operation of very efficient CCMs (i.e., high Ci affinities) in all species, but there were species-specific differences in CO2-dependent regulation of individual CCM components (i.e., CO2 and HCO3- uptake kinetics, carbonic anhydrase activities). Gross CO2 uptake rates appear to increase with the cell surface area to volume ratios. Species competition experiments with C. debilis and P. subcurvata under different PCO2 levels confirmed the CO2-stimulated growth of C. debilis observed in monospecific incubations, also in the presence of P. subcurvata. Independent of PCO2, high initial cell abundances of P. subcurvata led to reduced growth rates of C. debilis. For a better understanding of future changes in phytoplankton communities, CO2-sensitive physiological processes need to be identified, but also species interactions must be taken into account because their interplay determines the success of a species. © 2013, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,"acidification; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; growth rate; interspecific interaction; marine ecosystem; partial pressure; phytoplankton; sensitivity analysis; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877741941

Its Centerstack Assembly (CSA) consists of the inner legs of the Toroidal Field windings, the Ohmic Heating solenoid, the inner Poloidal Field (PF) coils, thermal insulation, diagnostics, and an Inconel casing which forms the inner wall of the vacuum vessel boundary. The outside surface of this casing is protected from the heat loads by a layer of Plasma Facing Components (PFCs), in this case, a combination of ATJ and POCO TM graphite. The CSA is electrically isolated from the outer, large major radius part of the vacuum chamber by ceramic insulators. The gaps at the top and bottom of the machine between the CSA and the outer vessel are known as the 'Coaxial Helicity Injection (CHI) Gaps'. The PF-1C divertor coils are located in this region shadowed by the CHI gap, however, late in the design of the NSTX Upgrade PFCs, MHD equilibria were discovered which could direct field lines through these CHI gaps and onto the PF-1C stainless steel casings. This could result in thermal flux from the main plasma body to flow along the field lines directly onto the coil. Though the probability of such an event is low, the heat flux on the 0.125' thick stainless steel casing could damage the coil beneath, or in worst case, rupture the casing itself, resulting in an accidental vent of the vacuum vessel. By extending downward the overhanging edge of the row 1 PFCs on the Outboard Divertor (OBD) and the Inboard Divertor (IBD) and by increasing their outermost radii, effectively narrowing the CHI gap, this should provide significant protection to the PF-1C casing. © 2013 IEEE.","CHI Gap; Coaxial Helicity Injection; NSTX-U; PF-1C; Plasma-Facing Components; Poloidal Field Coils","CHI Gap; Coaxial helicity injections; NSTX-U; PF-1C; Plasma-facing components; Poloidal Field coils; Aspect ratio; Heat flux; Plasmas; Vacuum; Fusion reactor divertors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890501590

This study provides the first evaluation for hydrological impact studies of one of these high-resolution simulations in a 1800 km2 catchment located in North Morocco. Different approaches are compared to analyze the climate change impacts on the hydrology of this catchment using a high-resolution RCM (ALADIN-Climate) from the Med-CORDEX initiative at two different spatial resolutions (50 and 12 km) and for two different Radiative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The main issues addressed in the present study are: (i) what is the impact of increased RCM resolution on present-climate hydrological simulations and on future projections? (ii) Are the bias-correction of the RCM model and the parameters of the hydrological model stationary and transferable to different climatic conditions? (iii) What is the climate and hydrological change signal based on the new Radiative Concentration Pathways scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5)? Results indicate that high resolution simulations at 12 km better reproduce the seasonal patterns, the seasonal distributions and the extreme events of precipitation. The parameters of the hydrological model, calibrated to reproduce runoff at the monthly time step over the 1984-2010 period, do not show a strong variability between dry and wet calibration periods in a differential split-sample test. However the bias correction of precipitation by quantile-matching does not give satisfactory results in validation using the same differential split-sample testing method. Therefore a quantile-perturbation method that does not rely on any stationarity assumption and produces ensembles of perturbed series of precipitation was introduced. The climate change signal under scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 indicates a decrease of respectively-30 to-57% in surface runoff for the mid-term (2041-2062), when for the same period the projections for precipitation are ranging between-15 and-19% and for temperature between +1.3 and +1.9 ○ C. © Author(s) 2013.

Combined heat and power (CHP) or cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electricity and useful thermal energy. The big interest this technology is receiving, both globally and locally, has its reason in the chance of reducing fuel consumption by enhancing energy production processes. The considerable amount of waste heat associated to traditional power stations is transformed into useful heat, which can be sent through the district network to houses and buildings for heating or cooling. Considering the pollution district heating reduce local pollutants such as dust, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by replacing exhausts from individual boilers. In addition to the reduced use of fuels, far more effective pollution prevention and control measures can be taken in central production facilities. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the investigation for the installation of a small-scale CHP plant for District Heating purposes in a small municipality in Northern Greece. Initially the heat and electricity demands were estimated based on a combination of historical consumption data, the construction features of the buildings and the weather conditions in the region. A pipe network was designed and sized appropriately and the utilization of a CHP plant was studied. Additionally, a number of various fuel options were considered such as natural gas, oil, pulverised coal and biomass from crop and forest residues, and also animal waste. The availability in biomass in the local region was estimated and it was found that it could cover a small percentage of approximately 5% of the required heating power. Finally, a techno-economic analysis was carried out and the CO2 reduction benefits were estimated.

High costs are basically due to energy consumption and membrane cleaning or replacement. Membrane fouling is responsible for reducing treated water production and increasing maintenance as well as operation costs. According to previous researches, the addition of Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) in high dosages could reduce membrane fouling; but such concentrations are economically unsustainable for operative conditions. A MBR pilot plant, fed by mixed liquor of a full-scale activated sludge process from a municipal wastewater treatment plant, was operated dosing low PAC concentrations (0, 2, 5, 10 and 20 mg·L-1, respectively). Experiments were also carried out at two different temperatures corresponding to summer and winter conditions. Results indicated that PAC addition was effective at the low dosages (2 and 5 mg·L-1) by reducing the permeate flux loss (from 16 up to 27%, respectively) while higher PAC concentrations turns out in a useless cost increase. © 2013 by the authors.","Fouling; Membrane bioreactor; Municipal wastewater; Pilot plant; Powdered activated carbon","activated carbon; activated sludge; antifouling; bioreactor; concentration (composition); cost-benefit analysis; fouling; membrane; sewage treatment; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882585709

Sustaining oil production at current levels is a constant challenge; thus a large local operator is exploring unconventional methods in their quest to optimize rig utilization by implementing novel rigless work-over interventions. One of the Marine Region most common interventions is production tubing clean-out. The objective of these interventions is the removal of deposits layers, asphaltenes and scale bridges in order to regain access to the producing intervals, and in some cases to eliminate the detrimental effect in production caused by reduced flow in scaled areas. Traditional clean-out methodology includes tubing conveyance, pumping of cleaning fluids and the operation of hydraulic or mechanical downhole tools. E-line conveyed technology enables rigless clean-outs by mechanical removal of debris from production tubing, safety devices like SSSV and plug seats, saving deferred production and allowing the operator to optimize rig utilization. The cleaning tool run on a well tractor and e-line has proved to be a reliable and effective solution for clean-out applications. E-line tractor assisted clean-out technology induces zero damage to the produced zone. The ability of removing debris from the wellbore without pumping a single drop of fluid into the well represents a major turnover into traditional workover approach. E-line conveyed clean-out enables operators to perform environmental friendly interventions, with reduced personnel and carbon footprint, enabling logistics optimization. This paper examines these recent applications of through-tubing e-line conveyed well intervention solutions in Mexico's marine regions and presents the relevant well conditions and criteria used for selection. It provides case histories with operational challenges as well as the results of several successful, rig-less cleaning operations on an important producing wells.

Additionally, since appropriate forest management can reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, it is important to estimate the magnitude of these services to include them into climate policy. We used a forest inventory stratified by canopy cover in the oak-pine forest of La Primavera Biosphere Reserve in México (30,500 ha), to assess the potential provision of forest carbon services. Inventory results were used in combination with a Landsat image to estimate carbon stocks in arboreal biomass. Potential carbon removals were calculated from published allometric equations and models estimating tree growth rates, for enhancements in forested areas and for reforestation/afforestation. Carbon stocks estimated in arboreal biomass at the time of the inventory were 4.16 MtCO2eq (3.42-4.89). The potential for further carbon sequestration and enhancement could take the level of stocks up to 9.77 MtCO2eq (7.66-11.89, 95% confidence interval); previous fires have degraded carbon stocks below their natural potential. The results present a gradient of carbon stocks for different degradation levels and are consistent with national and international estimates and previous local research. The baseline for the estimation of reduced emissions is critical for assessing the overall contribution of forests to mitigate climate change. The local baseline of emissions might be around 1% according to historical data; however, when enhancements and reduced emissions are valuated together, a baseline of 3.7% is required to prevent the creation of perverse incentives favouring previously degraded areas; considering these figures for reduced emissions, the yearly carbon services provided by La Primavera, including enhancements, sequestration and reduced emissions, could be between 169.4 ktCO2eq/year (134.8-204.5) and 282.1 ktCO2eq/year (228.2-337.1), respectively. Over a period of 60 years, this would be equivalent to 2.4 and 4.1 times the magnitude of mean standing stocks at the time of the inventory. If incentive-based mechanisms are used to maintain and enhance forest carbon services and perverse incentives are to be avoided, a balanced mix of incentives and controls is needed. © 2013 by the authors.","Carbon markets; Carbon sequestration; Forest management; Forest monitoring; Positive incentives","Allometric equations; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Carbon markets; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Confidence interval; Forest monitoring; Positive incentives; Atmospheric chemistry; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Deforestation; Estimation; Forestry; Carbon; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; deforestation; emission control; forest canopy; forest management; incentive; Landsat; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Deforestation; Forestry; Incentives; Mexico; Seasonal Variation; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888769735

Our main finding is that previously private firms outperform previously SOE firms in China after IPOs. In the wake of becoming listed firms, previously SOE firms might be faced with difficulties adjusting to professional business practices to build and extend competitive advantages. In addition, favorable policies and assistance from the government to the SOE firms might have triggered complacency, especially in early years after getting listed. On the other hand, professional savvy and acumen, combined with efficiency and favorable business climate created by the government have probably led the previously private firms to improve their values stronger and faster.","Chinese listed firms; Corporate governance; Firm performance; Initial public offerings; Private firms; State-owned enterprises",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880794200

Due to increased public and scientific community awareness on the environmental impact of the construction industry extensive efforts have been put to reduce the CO 2 emissions of the Portland cement plants. A major step in the direction of sustainable development has been done with the development of alternative cementitious binders. An important source of such materials is the industry. The present paper presents the results of a research work focused on the suitability of using a new mineral binder as partial replacement of ordinary Portland cement in concrete. At this stage of the research the strength and elastic properties of mortars incorporating various percentages of the new binder were investigated. The binder is obtained from industrial by-products, most of them being disposed in landfills. The experimental results lead to the conclusion that lighter structural or non-structural elements could be made with the incorporation of the new binder. In terms of bending tensile strength the obtained values were much higher than the reference mix proportion. On the other hand, the compressive strength did not match that of the reference mix. The volume of Portland cement substitution as well as the type of cement plays an important role on the strength and elastic properties of the mortars. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While some lessons have been learned from vinyl chloride contamination resulting in angiosarcoma in workers in rubber plants and from hydrocarbon contamination resulting in fatty liver disease in residents near a petroleum plant in Brazil, there is increasing concern about arsenic contamination of water sources in many countries, including the United States. The introduction of hydraulic fracturing in order to recover natural gas and oil from rock and shale formations has resulted in air and ground contamination with known hepatotoxins and carcinogens, which raises new concerns because of the lack of regulation of this industry.While the science of predicting acute hepatotoxicity has advanced greatly in terms of pathophysiologic mechanisms, testing models, and genetic susceptibility, little research has been done regarding low-dose chronic exposure to potential toxins.The politicizing of economic concerns versus health concerns has resulted in the financial undermining of the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Tm-doped silica fibre lasers provide an efficient way to access the relevant wavelength region due to the wide emission line that extends from ∼1700 nm to ∼2100 nm.

These buildings, once built, are bound to be utilized for several decades if not longer. The building sector, therefore, holds a significant responsibility for implementing strategies to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions and thus contribute to global efforts directed toward mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. This paper presents an overview of the effect of building orientation on energy consumption in buildings for the extreme cold weather conditions in Astana (capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan), with temperature ranging between -35 and +40 C. Passive design features coupled with integration of renewable energy technologies have been identified for the next generation of buildings in Astana. The specific nature of the work is intentional; it is a continuing attempt to generate relevant know how that has direct relevancy to Astana's system approach to energy conservation to meet its extreme winters. Simulations allowed assessing how changing certain input variables can impact the overall energy consumption of the considered object. The simulation results have shown that orientation of a building can significantly affect the energy usage rate. In fact, the building rotation has justified the initial assumptions that building orientation affects its energy consumption. The South and North facing directions are found to be the most energy efficient (initial orientation is 35 degrees toward the North-East). These findings have been confirmed by the separate calculations based on the local and international standards and codes.

This is particularly important in cities in developing regions, which often have a history of under-investment in infrastructure and services and experience constraints in finance, resource access, limited data and capacity, whilst experiencing rapid population and economic growth. Makassar city, the capital of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, is a typical example. With a population of 1.3 million people, increasing access to clean water supply to a millennium development goal level is a key government objective. However, access to water depends on multiple factors: the city's surface water supplies which are subject to strong seasonal effects, the availability and condition of the infrastructure for water treatment and distribution, water use patterns and the resources and capacity of the city to invest and maintain their system. To aid in the assessment of water security and to build the capacity in the region, CSIRO and Hasanuddin University in conjunction with local government agencies developed a framework for water security assessment (Figure 1). The framework included climate change projections, evaluated its potential impacts on surface water hydrology and urban water security for Makassar city and then focused on the development of adaptation options. Integral to the development of the framework was the participation of stakeholders (government agencies, researchers, NGOs and academics) at all stages of the process. By integrating top-down and bottom up knowledge (scientific modelling outputs and local knowledge) the project was able to identify vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of planned infrastructure to climate change and urban development and to identify a range of adaptation options which can assist in increasing the future security of water supply. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Climate change adaptation; Hydrological modelling; Sustainable urban development","Decision making; Economics; Hydrology; Investments; Operations research; Population statistics; Surface water resources; Surface waters; Urban growth; Water supply; Water treatment; Climate change adaptation; Climate change projections; Hydrological modelling; Millennium development goals; Regional climate changes; Surface water hydrology; Sustainable urban development; Urban water securities; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060860597

Industry and energy sector together are responsible for a major share of those emissions. Hence the development of low carbon business parks by maximising energy efficiency and changing to collective, renewable energy systems at local level holds a high reduction potential. Yet, there is no uniform approach to determine the optimal combination and operation of energy technologies composing such energy systems. However, techno-economic energy models, custom tailored for business parks, can offer a solution, as they identify the configuration and operation that provide an optimal trade-off between economic and environmental performances. However, models specifically developed for industrial park energy systems are not detected in literature, so identifying an existing model that can be adapted is an essential step. In this paper, energy model classifications are scanned for adequate model characteristics and accordingly, a confined number of models are selected and described. Subsequently, main model features are compared, a practical typology is proposed and applicability towards modelling industrial park energy systems is evaluated. Energy system evolution models offer the most perspective to compose a holistic, but simplified model, whereas advanced energy system integration models can adequately be employed to assess energy integration for business clusters up to entire industrial sites. Energy system simulation models, however, provide deeper insight in the system's operation.

Information and communications technology (ICT) increasingly plays a key role in this transformation, both on the supply and demand side. While 85% of the residential energy in the DACH region is consumed by space and water heating, the vast majority of work in the energy informatics field does not focus on these two critical end uses. And yet, the discipline could contribute greatly to reducing consumption and emissions in this area - often with a close nexus to electricity. Besides, direct, real-time feedback on hot water consumption has a particularly high savings potential and can further broaden the sphere of impact of the energy informatics discipline. This paper describes a self-powered energy and water meter that provides users with such feedback in the shower. After an earlier proof of concept study with 60 households together with the Swiss Federal Office of Energy that yielded average energy and water savings of 22%, the smart shower meter has been developed into a mass-market compatible application that has been installed in 8,000 households. This was accompanied by a study with 700 households to verify its practical viability, consumer engagement, and effectiveness in the field. The device showcases a practical example of how ICT applications can be successfully implemented at scale to transform consumption patterns in emission-intense domains, also beyond electricity. © 2013 IEEE.","consumer engagement; direct & real-time feedback; energy-aware appliances; residential energy consumption; water-energy nexus","consumer engagement; Energy aware; Real-time feedback; Residential energy consumption; water-energy nexus; Economics; Energy utilization; Housing; Industrial electronics; Smart meters; Heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893592220

In this work, to reduce the drag of a van body truck, aerodynamic drag reduction designs are carried out by the method of numerical simulation. The external fluid flow physics over the complete 360 degree of van body is simulated numerically using CFD code considering various aerodynamic parameters. Spherical dimples are created on the trailer region of the van body in order to reduce drag. The results obtained numerically are validated with the experiments using wind tunnel carried out in the Fluid Machines laboratory of VIT University. Upon validation the numerical study is extended to parametric studies, by changing the size of dimples and distances between them. These modifications on the surface have been studied for their influence on aerodynamic drag, with the motive of reducing it and to conserve the engine power and reducing emissions. The study shows that as the diameter of the dimple are reduced the drag coefficient decreases. Reducing the effective distance between dimples also affects the drag experienced by the body. © Research India Publications.","Drag coefficient; Golf ball dimples; Van body",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890404828

Existing observing networks have been designed largely in support of operational weather forecasting and continue to be run in this mode. Coverage and timeliness are often higher priorities than absolute traceability and accuracy. Changes in instrumentation used in the observing system, as well as in operating procedures, are frequent, rarely adequately documented and their impacts poorly quantified. For monitoring changes in upper-air climate, which is achieved through in-situ soundings and more recently satellites and ground-based remote sensing, the net result has been trend uncertainties as large as, or larger than, the expected emergent signals of climate change. This is more than simply academic with the tropospheric temperature trends issue having been the subject of intense debate, two international assessment reports and several US congressional hearings. For more than a decade the international climate science community has been calling for the instigation of a network of reference quality measurements to reduce uncertainty in our climate monitoring capabilities.

The 1987 Montreal Protocol established strict regulations on the use of CFCs that has lessened this air pollutant in developed countries. Reductions of CFC use have resulted in ozone recovery in the stratosphere, which helps to protect humans from exposure to UV radiation that is harmful to cells in the human body (such as the skin).

A fundamental challenge exists to link microbial biodiversity with plant-soil C cycling processes to elucidate the underlying mechanisms regulating soil carbon. To address this, we contrasted vegetated grassland soils with bare soils, which had been plant-free for 3 years, using stable isotope (13C) labeled substrate assays and molecular analyses of bacterial communities. Vegetated soils had higher C and N contents, biomass, and substrate-specific respiration rates. Conversely, following substrate addition unlabeled, native soil C cycling was accelerated in bare soil and retarded in vegetated soil; indicative of differential priming effects. Functional differences were reflected in bacterial biodiversity with Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria dominating vegetated and bare soils, respectively. Significant isotopic enrichment of soil RNA was found after substrate addition and rates varied according to substrate type. However, assimilation was independent of plant presence which, in contrast to large differences in 13CO2 respiration rates, indicated greater substrate C use efficiency in bare, Acidobacteria-dominated soils. Stable isotope probing (SIP) revealed most community members had utilized substrates with little evidence for competitive outgrowth of sub-populations. Our findings support theories on how plant-mediated soil resource availability affects the turnover of different pools of soil carbon, and we further identify a potential role of soil microbial biodiversity. Specifically we conclude that emerging theories on the life histories of dominant soil taxa can be invoked to explain changes in soil carbon cycling linked to resource availability, and that there is a strong case for considering microbial biodiversity in future studies investigating the turnover of different pools of soil carbon. © 2013 Thomson, Ostle, McNamara, Oakley, Whiteley, Bailey and Griffiths.","Bacteria; Priming effects; RNA stable isotope probing; Soil organic carbon; Substrate carbon use efficiency; Substrate-specific respiration; T-RFLP; Upland acidic grassland","bacterial RNA; carbon; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; organic carbon; Acidobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; article; biomass; carbon cycling; controlled study; grassland; isotope labeling; microbial community; nonhuman; plant environment interaction; plant soil interaction; soil property; soil respiration; species diversity; turnover time; Acidobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885393772

Nowadays, the effects of economic crisis, together with growing environmental and technological risks, trigger the vulnerability of these areas and stress the need for resilience. This paper examines the role of strategic spatial planning in promoting metropolitan resilience in the era of crisis. It is argued that this type of planning is capable of supporting the adaptation of territorial systems to crisis-induced risks, as is, for instance, the case of planning for climate change. This is further analysed in light of four of the key aspects of the new strategic spatial planning, namely its principles, content, process, and utilization of resources. The paper draws evidence from the case of Greece and examines the abovementioned aspects of the recently prepared new Regulatory Plan for the Thessaloniki greater area. The first results of this examination show that, provided there is political will which allows for necessary adjustments, the Plan has the potential to incorporate the dimension of resilience. The elaboration and exploitation of the strategic nature of the Plan and of its sustainable development principle constitute key elements of a resilience-oriented approach.","Metropolitan resilience; Metropolitan vulnerability; Resilience planning; Strategic spatial planning in Greece; Thessaloniki metropolitan area",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896384518

The natural energy resources are far away from the load centres and strong environmental constraints e.g. CO2 emissions effecting climate change lead to limitation on expansion of conventional power plants. Also in many regions such as in Europe the energy policies has been progressively promoting renewable energy sources (RES) with maintaining an acceptable system reliability standard. For this reason many of the large scale renewable sources like onshore and offshore wind farms have been installed far away from consumption areas. Furthermore the future development under DESERTEC concept focuses on transmitting large amounts of solar power from remote deserts in Mediterranean area as well as in Mongolia, China, Middle East, Europe and North Africa over thousands of kilometres to load centres. Additionally after Fukushima event the using of nuclear power plant becomes a concerned issue around the world. To keep the energy security and sustainability for Asia in the 21st century, in Japan the ""Asia Super Grid"" to share the energy resources of each country in Asia over 36,000 km transmission system is an emerging issue. It can be seen that to fulfil the above requirements, an efficient transmission system is necessary. Currently HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) and FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems) of both LCC (Line-Commutated Converter) and VSC (Voltage-Sourced Converter) technology are the mature technologies to enhance the transmission systems with the advantage of using power electronic devices providing fast control and reaction which are essential for system stability. For HVDC application due to lower losses in comparison with AC systems, an increase in efficiency of long distance power transmission with lower losses is feasible. This provides the possibility to connect onshore and offshore wind power, remote hydro power plants and reducing CO2 emission from fossil power plants. Regarding the power system stability the precise and controllable power effectively improves the rotor angle, voltage and frequency stability in synchronous and asynchronous systems. In terms of environmental and social concerns the Right-of-Way (ROW) of a DC system is narrower due to the requirement of only two instead of three conductors versus six in AC (for n-1 redundancy), and less concerns of electrical and magnetic field impact. For series and parallel FACTS applications, generally FACTS controllers can be an efficient solution for the power systems which suffer from transmission line congestion, inter-area and local power system oscillations, flicker, various voltages at different load condition, reactive power balancing, high short-circuit current and voltage/angle stability. In the paper, the application and projects of HVDC LCC, HVDC VSC (HVDC PLUS®) and SVC LCC as well as STATCOM (SVC PLUS®) and their combinations are discussed. Furthermore, the Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) which is applied for HVDC PLUS and SVC PLUS will be explained to show the benefits of VSC innovation. Finally the reference projects will be shown to emphasize the importance of HVDC and FACTS for enhancing the transmission system, consequently power system in future. © 2013 CIGRE.

To reflect the inherent and methodological uncertainties in climate modeling, the assessment of regional climate change requires ensemble simulations from different global and regional climate model combinations. To interpret the spread of simulated results, it is useful to understand how the climate change signal is modified in the GCM-RCM modelmodelgeneral circulation model-regional climate model (GCM-RCM) chain. This kind of information can also be useful for impact modelers; for the process of experiment design and when interpreting model results. In this study, we investigate how the simulated historical and future climate of the Max-Planck-Institute earth system model (MPI-ESM) is modified by dynamic downscaling with the regional model REMO in different world regions. The historical climate simulations for 1950-2005 are driven by observed anthropogenic forcing. The climate projections are driven by projected anthropogenic forcing according to different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The global simulations are downscaled with REMO over the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) domains Africa, Europe, South America and West Asia from 2006-2100. This unique set of simulations allows for climate type specific analysis across multiple world regions and for multi-scenarios. We used a classification of climate types by Köppen-Trewartha to define evaluation regions with certain climate conditions. A systematic comparison of near-surface temperature and precipitation simulated by the regional and the global model is done. In general, the historical time period is well represented by the GCM and the RCM. Some different biases occur in the RCM compared to the GCM as in the Amazon Basin, northern Africa and the West Asian domain. Both models project similar warming, although somewhat less so by the RCM for certain regions and climate types. A common feature in regions of tropical climate types is that REMO shows dryer climate conditions than forMax Planck Institute for Meteorology-Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, leading to an opposing sign in the climate change signal. With an increase in radiative forcing from RCP 2.6 to RCP 8.5 and towards the end of the 21st century, some of the detected differences between GCM and RCM are more pronounced. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","CORDEX; Dynamical downscaling; Köppen-trewartha climate classification; MPI-ESM; RCP; Regional climate simulations; REMO","Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Computer simulation; Earth (planet); Experiments; Uncertainty analysis; CORDEX; Dynamical downscaling; MPI-ESM; RCP; Regional climate simulation; REMO; Climate models; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; climate modeling; climate prediction; downscaling; global climate; regional climate; Africa; Amazon Basin; Europe; West Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885123950

Due to the increasing interest for the fine particles (PM2.5) the measurement program of the network has been extended to include PM2.5 measurements into the measurement program at several countries. It has well know that the effect of air pollution on health depends on pollutant concentrations and the type of exposure and city-wide health risk assessment. In this study, PM levels and their sources, fractions, temporal and spatial variations and relation with meteorological factors have been determined in both of urban and rural areas. PM samplers were collected during this study period using Anderson Dichotomous sampler. During October 2009-October 2010 the collected PM-fine, PM-coarse, and PM10 mass concentrations were 31.07, 15,52 and 46.53 μg/m3 for city atmosphere and 20.57, 14.34 and 34.92 μg/m3 in rural atmosphere, respectively. The concentration of PM2.5, and PM10 were higher in heating seasons than in summer time, in urban areas. Size fraction ratios of PM2.5 and PM2.5-10, were estimated in both stations. In urban area, Seasonal variations in the rate of PM2,5/PM10 which is an expression of the relative contribution to total inhalable particles were analyzed and found that this ratio is higher during the winter season than summer season. But, in rural areas, the rate of PM fractions did not significantly change seasonally. As expected, the low PM concentrations are associated with rural atmospheric conditions.

The atmospheric pollution in some Cameroonian cities is increasing with the industrial development and urbanization. Air pollution is inherently complex, containing PM of varied size and composition. This PM exists as a dynamic cloud interacting with sunlight and is modified by the meteorology. The reflectometer and the EDXRF spectrometry are applied to determine the concentration of some specific elements at four sites in the city of Yaoundé. The particular aim of the present work is to put in place data base on air pollution in urban area and elaborate regulations on the emissions issued to industrial and vehicle activities. This study provides an overview of the concentration of black carbon and some specific elements in the air, which have impacts on human health. The measurement was done by distinguishing the size of particle. So that, the particle with aerodynamic diameter between 2.5-10 μm (so-called coarse particle) and aerodynamic diameter &lt;2.5 μm (so-called fine particle) were considered to obtain more information about levels of the inhalable fraction of the location. The results obtained in four locations of the city of Yaoundé show that the black carbon concentration is very considerable, the element sulfur is a major pollutant and the concentration of fine particle is very greater. The results obtained of fine and coarse filters range from 5-17 μg/m3 and 10-18 μg/m3 for the black carbon. S, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, As, Se and Hg are the specific findings of this work. The pollutants with a greater concentration are S, Pb, and Zn. These later seem to be non-uniformly, non-regular in some location and high compared to other countries. This work allows us to make a potential relation between pollutants and emission sources. In this framework, some suggestions have been proposed to reduce emissions for an improvement of the air quality in the environment and thus, the one of the city of Yaoundé.","Black carbon; Coarse particles; EDXRF; Reflectometer; Trace element",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883216172

While the composite collections revealed no predominance of one coiling direction over the other, two of the seven locality samples showed a statistically significant dominance of sinistral over dextral screws. The two samples with a dominance of sinistral screws may be either statistical artefacts or due to the fragmentation of long sinistral screws.

Understanding how the occurrence of drought may change in the future and which sources of uncertainty are dominant can inform appropriate decisions to guide drought impacts assessments. Our study considers both climate model uncertainty associated with future climate projections, and future emissions of greenhouse gases (future scenario uncertainty). Four drought indices (the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), Soil Moisture Anomaly (SMA), the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Standardised Runoff Index (SRI)) are calculated for the A1B and RCP2.6 future emissions scenarios using monthly model output from a 57-member perturbed parameter ensemble of climate simulations of the HadCM3C Earth System model, for the baseline period 1961-1990, and the period 2070-2099 (""the 2080s""). We consider where there are statistically significant increases or decreases in the proportion of time spent in drought in the 2080s compared to the baseline. Despite the large range of uncertainty in drought projections for many regions, projections for some regions have a clear signal, with uncertainty associated with the magnitude of change rather than direction. For instance, a significant increase in time spent in drought is generally projected for the Amazon, Central America and South Africa whilst projections for northern India consistently show significant decreases in time spent in drought. Whilst the patterns of changes in future drought were similar between scenarios, climate mitigation, represented by the RCP2.6 scenario, tended to reduce future changes in drought. In general, climate mitigation reduced the area over which there was a significant increase in drought but had little impact on the area over which there was a significant decrease in time spent in drought. © Author(s) 2013.",,"Climate mitigations; Climate simulation; Emissions scenarios; Future climate projections; Model uncertainties; Palmer drought severity indices; Precipitation indices; Sources of uncertainty; Climate models; Computer simulation; Earth (planet); Greenhouse gases; Soil moisture; Uncertainty analysis; Drought; climate change; drought; environmental impact assessment; numerical model; water availability; Amazonia; Central America; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880769421

Turbochargers are well-adapted to this purpose but one of their biggest drawbacks is the turbo-lag which reduces the driving comfort especially during acceleration. Electrically driven compressors also known as E-compressor or E-booster could be a well-adapted solution to boost the engine intake pressure in order to reduce the turbo-lag. Since centrifugal compressors operate at high rotational speeds, high speed electric machines are therefore required. To achieve a significant reduction of the turbo-lag, a very fast response time is needed leading to the development of electric machines able to typically spin from idle to 75kRPM in less than 300ms. With 20 years of expertise in the development of innovative brushless DC motors for automotive applications, MMT has recently investigated the design of such high power-high rotation speed motors. After first integrated an electric motor into a turbocharger described in [1], MMT has decided to optimize the complete system in collaboration with SwissAuto Wenko AG, a specialist in the design and characterization of advanced charging systems. The initial specification was an overpressure of 1.3 within 300ms, reached by using a 2kW@80kRPMs electric motor. The motor optimization, the mechanical design of the system as well as experimental measurements are presented.

In this paper, sustainability aspects of decentralizing urban water infrastructure systems have been studied through a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) software package, namely Economic and Environmental Analysis of Sanitation Technologies (EEAST), and compared with the current condition (centralized infrastructure). Specifically, rainwater harvesting (RWH) has been selected as the decentralized infrastructure for a case study watershed in Toledo, Ohio. RWH is one of several types of low impact development (LID) tools that has been widely used to control urban floods and runoff water quality according to its quality and quantity aspects. For urban water system modeling in this study PCSWWM has been employed. The model has been driven by using 24-hour design storm event, and then the volume of runoff and life cycle impacts of cisterns has been studied after implementation of RWH systems.

The downsizing efforts result in engines with lower displacement as well as lower number of cylinders. In addition to cylinder and displacement downsizing the development community embarks on continued efforts toward down-speeding. The combination of the aforementioned factors results in engines which can have high levels of torsional vibrations. Such behavior can have detrimental effects on the drivetrain particularly during the development phase of these. Driveshafts, couplings, and dynamometers are exposed to these torsional forces and depending on their frequency costly damages in these components can occur. To account for these effects, FEV employs a multi-body-system modeling approach through which base engine information is used to determine optimized drivetrain setups. All mechanical elements in the setup are analyzed based on their torsional behavior. Bending and axial vibration are considered in the analysis as well. During the early stages of engine development, very little information is available to ensure proper drivetrain layout. To ensure highest possible usefulness of the modeling tool, the developed algorithms can function with very limited input data. The moments of inertia, stiffness, and dampening of the five major groups - crankshaft, piston assembly, flywheel, driveshaft, dynamometer - are required to ensure successful processing. A large database with known components can support the process in case precise target data is not available. Cylinder pressure information allows to further increase the accuracy of the results. All available information is processed and the natural frequencies and Eigen modes are determined. This basis allows further optimization of the drivetrain through modifications of the critical parameters of flywheel and driveshaft. The optimized result allows robust and reliable engine testing under all operating conditions.

Extremely low particle concentrations may be reached without a danger of vehicle occupants' exposure to elevated CO2 levels. The lowest values of particle concentrations inside a PC without air purifier are registered under the recirculation ventilation mode, but the issue of CO2 accumulation limits the use of this mode to very short driving events. Lower PM concentrations are found inside newer cars, if this ventilation mode is used. Great differences by a factor of 2.5-3 in PM10 concentrations are found between the PCs and the buses.

Over societally relevant timescales, diverse physical, biological, and chemical processes in the global ocean have a very important role in controlling the exchanges of CO2 with the atmosphere and climate, given that the ocean contains roughly 60 times more carbon than the atmosphere. The complex and dynamic marine carbon cycle is thus a fundamental part and regulator of life on Earth, requiring monitoring of its variability and understanding of the feedbacks to the climate system. This is particularly relevant given that emissions of human produced (anthropogenic) CO2 through fossil fuel and land use changes have led to significant perturbations in the global carbon cycle. A large fraction of emitted anthropogenic carbon (Cant) has been and will be absorbed by the oceans with implications for seawater chemistry, ocean pH levels, and the biological communities contained within. During the last few decades, quantification of the ocean sink of CO2 and its temporal evolution of the marine carbon cycle has been an important driver of marine biogeochemical research. Scientific expeditions such as the World Ocean Circulation Experiment/Joint Global Ocean Flux Study global surveys conducted during the 1990s provided the data for the first global estimates of the uptake and oceanic sink of Cant. More recently, completion of a second global survey of the marine carbon cycle (from 2000 to 2013) provided sufficient data to assess the rate of uptake and storage of Cant within the interior of the global ocean. From this effort, it has become clear that there is substantial regional and temporal variability of the storage rate of Cant and those physico-biogeochemical processes that influence the marine carbon cycle. Here we review seawater carbonate chemistry, the sampling strategies, and networks required to observe variability in the global ocean carbon cycle and the flux of carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere but with a central focus, synthesizing and summarizing available estimates of the ocean uptake and inventories of Cant.

A transition from conventional urban development models to a green or low-carbon future needs to change the system of the ""systems"", such as energy, water, waste, mobility, and infrastructure systems. Cities are facing huge pressure and great opportunities to make these transitions through more effective arrangement of land use development footprints. This book introduces the significant trend of urban planning towards green growth and low-carbon development patterns and reviews the history of urban development models while illustrating key concepts underpinning theories of green growth and low-carbon development. It presents a ground-breaking analysis of the role of urban planning in the translation of green growth and low-carbon development and also provides an up-to-date discussion of current practices with a vision of new urbanism and post-modern land use planning patterns. Introduced in this book are broad concepts of urban and land use planning, and a description of practical planning approaches. The authors explain how to incorporate core ""green"" and ""low-carbon"" concepts into urban planning and community development. Also discussed are the tools and processes necessary to develop a green and low-carbon development strategy where the major methods include energy conservation and efficiency, transportation planning, livability and walkability techniques, environmental planning, low impact community design skills, planning support systems, and public participation. A diverse range of examples, from North America, Europe, Africa, and China, are provided to analyze the barriers and solutions in socio-technical transitions emerging in different urban contexts. An international context of urban planning and a proposed model to assess future conditions, evaluate policy choices, create visions, and compare scenarios is presented. The topics in this book add to existing urban planning literature on social translations and introduce critical questions in making the translation of complex urban systems. This book can help academics, policy makers, practitioners and researchers interested in the development of green cities and low-carbon development. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

If urben refuse is put into the cement kiln, processing it, producing cement, it will benefit all. This mature method has no influence on neither the cement production nor the quality of cement products, however the indexes of all emissions in the manufacturing meet the national standards. Statistics show the heat generated by every ton of waste is equal to that of 183kg standard coals; the cinders are mixed in cement during the treatment process, thus 107kilograms substitute raw materials can be generated by every ton of waste, and 6 to 7 percent are added. Moreever, it reduces carbon dioxide emission 8000 tons for every 10,000 tons waste. This paper concludes: the utilization of cement kiln to incinerate domestic waste has obvious advantages in environmental protection and total investment does not cost much. The municipal engineering construction has the priority to use the products from domestic treatment cement factories, and domestic waste incineration cement factories should be under self-management.

In this study, OMI satellite observations of NO2 column densities are used to conduct inverse modeling of NOx emission inventories for two Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) modeling episodes. Addition of lightning, aircraft, and soil NOx emissions to the regulatory inventory narrowed but did not close the gap between modeled and satellite-observed NO2 over rural regions. Satellite-based top-down emission inventories are created with the regional Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx) using two techniques: the direct scaling method and discrete Kalman filter (DKF) with decoupled direct method (DDM) sensitivity analysis. The simulations with satellite-inverted inventories are compared to the modeling results using the a priori inventory as well as an inventory created by a ground-level NO 2-based DKF inversion. The DKF inversions yield conflicting results: the satellite-based inversion scales up the a priori NOx emissions in most regions by factors of 1.02 to 1.84, leading to 3-55% increase in modeled NO2 column densities and 1-7 ppb increase in ground 8 h ozone concentrations, while the ground-based inversion indicates the a priori NO x emissions should be scaled by factors of 0.34 to 0.57 in each region. However, none of the inversions improve the model performance in simulating aircraft-observed NO2 or ground-level ozone (O3) concentrations. © Author(s) 2013.",,"air quality; emission inventory; inverse analysis; Kalman filter; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; rural atmosphere; sensitivity analysis; soil emission; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887474480

Low flow frequency analysis was used to estimate drought severity (eg. 1-in-100-year average recurrence interval) of different drought durations from several months to years. Traditionally this was done using available historical streamflow record. However, recent research including the South Eastern Australian Climate Initiative has indicated that the prolonged drought experienced in southeastern Australia including Melbourne in the recent decade since 1997 has been unprecedented in historical context, and is potentially part of a long-term trend associated with global warming. This raises the issue of the practicality of the assumption of hydrologic stationarity. To account for the potential for more severe and frequent drought events, an adaptive approach is needed to adapt to the drier future in a changing and variable climate by considering experience from the recent 1997-2009 drought and the latest climate change projections. In this paper, drought severity for the Melbourne system is estimated based on historical streamflow data with monthly flow prior to 1997 adjusted using a flow duration curve decile method to reflect the recent dry conditions of 1997-2009. The approach is consistent with recommendations in the Victorian Guidelines for the Development of a Water Supply-Demand Strategy (DSE, 2011). The results indicate that drought severity and frequency increased by an order of magnitude under a changed climate based on a ""return to dry"" scenario. This shift in severity and frequency highlights the need for adaptive planning methods to address changes in hydrologic conditions under a variable and changing climate. However, it also raises many challenges for drought planning including uncertainties in climate change projections, attribution of recent drought to climate change and variability, and the appropriate hydro-climate baseline for applying climate change projections. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.","""return to dry"" scenario; Adaptive management; Climate change and variability; Critical drought duration and storage drawdown; Drought response planning; Low flow frequency analysis; Water outlook","Digital storage; Drought; Global warming; Stream flow; Water levels; Water management; Water supply; Adaptive Management; Drought duration; Drought response; Low flow; return to dry scenario; Climate change; climate change; demand-side management; drought; estimation method; global climate; historical perspective; streamflow; urban policy; water management; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892516226

With the anticipation of increasing and changing nature of disaster risks due to climate change, the need for a holistic and integrated approach to climate and disaster management is recognised at the policy and institutional levels.

Future bridging of the climate change and disaster management communities in the country through the institutional and research platforms would require addressing several issues. Considering the uncertainty within climate projection, examining the biophysical sensitivity under exposure of projected future climates may be inadequate in gaining insight into their current adaptive capacity, and whether such adaptability will transform or facilitate actual adaptation in the future. As more adaptation initiatives will be implemented in the future, it is important to ensure adaptive capacity is drawn upon and translated into action by identifying and removing barriers to ensure successful adaptation.

Wind energy is a form of renewable energy resources (RES) which offers many advantages, particularly for countries such as Greece, which has a very promising wind potential. In addition, studies of citizens' views on the development of wind energy in Greece have been gaining particular attention due to recent decisions regarding the energy policy of Greece. More specifically, since August 2012, the examination of new applications for photovoltaic parks has been suspended, and only applications for wind parks are now being reviewed. The present research was conducted on the island of Andros, where a wind park has been in operation since 1992, with a total annual capacity of 4740 MW. The data collection was carried out in 2010 using a structured questionnaire, and involved the citizens as electrical energy consumers. In particular, their views were studied regarding their satisfaction with the quality and availability of electricity on the island, and the installation of wind turbines. They were then asked to evaluate how environmentally-friendly various forms of energy are, as well as the effects from the use of RES.

The assimilation of CO 2 requires the fine tuning of two co-existing functional modes: linear electron flow, which provides NADPH and ATP, and cyclic electron flow, which only sustains ATP synthesis. Although the importance of this fine tuning is appreciated, its mechanism remains equivocal. Here we show that cyclic electron flow as well as formation of supercomplexes, thought to contribute to the enhancement of cyclic electron flow, are promoted in reducing conditions with no correlation with the reorganization of the thylakoid membranes associated with the migration of antenna proteins towards Photosystems I or II, a process known as state transition. We show that cyclic electron flow is tuned by the redox power and this provides a mechanistic model applying to the entire green lineage including the vast majority of the cases in which state transition only involves a moderate fraction of the antenna. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The organisational framework should favour the consolidation of technology transfer through the establishment of appropriate mechanisms for capacity retention and private-sector involvement (i.e. public–private partnerships with independent power producers, renewable energy service companies, etc.). Ultimately, local capacity for maintaining and operating the technologies to be transferred is key. Every country or region has different priorities and reasons for desiring an increased deployment of renewable energy technologies: the EU has a focus on climate change mitigation, the US has a focus on energy security, and sub-Saharan African countries generally have the objective of energy access. Small Island Developing States in the Pacific have a clear focus on energy security at the regional level, while many of them also have an unfinished agenda for energy access. Technology transfer and cooperation efforts in the region must address the barriers to the deployment of renewable energy technologies to ensure long-lasting provision of energy access and durable improvement of energy security. Pacific energy ministers endorsed the Framework for Action on Energy Security in the Pacific (FAESP) and its associated implementation plan (IPESP) in April 2011.

In this perspective various enhancement methods such as doping with metals and non-metals and sensitization to expand TiO2 band gap toward visible region are critically discussed.

The findings of this study revealed both metals and non-metals could improve TiO2 photoactivity, but non-metals and especially co-metals were more efficient. The combination of co-metals with sensitizers exhibited much higher CO, CH4 and CH3OH yield rates. Among photocatalytic reactors, optical fibers and monolith photoreactors are more efficient because of their efficient light harvesting potential.

However, all of these studies have effectively ignored the distinction between rainfed and irrigated lands and neglected the facts that irrigated croplands typically have much higher yields than their rainfed counterparts in the same region and that expansion in irrigated crops are limited in some regions due to water scarcity and irrigation constraint. This paper shows that these omissions introduce systematic biases in the measurement of biofuel-induced land use change emissions. Methods: A new computable general equilibrium model which distinguishes irrigated and rainfed agriculture is developed. The new model is an enhanced version of the publicly available Global Trade Analysis Project model with Biofuels (GTAP-BIO) which has been widely used in this field frequently. To distinguish irrigated and rainfed agriculture, the biophysical component of the GTAP-BIO model is extensively modified using the most recent published data in this area. The economic component of the model is also modified to handle the distinction between irrigated and rainfed agriculture. Results: We find that ignoring the irrigated-rainfed distinction modestly underestimates global land use change, but results in sharply different geographic patterns of cropland expansion, with stronger rainfed expansion in more carbon-rich environments. This points to a significant underestimate of land use emissions in earlier studies. Conclusions: To provide more accurate estimates of biofuel-induced land use emissions, it is critical to incorporate the role of irrigation in crop production, taking into account the fact that expansion in irrigation is constrained in some regions across the world. © 2013 Taheripour et al.; licensee Springer.","Computational general equilibrium; GTAP-BIO; Indirect land use change; Irrigated agriculture; Irrigation constraints; Rainfed agriculture","Biofuels; Carbon; Crops; Cultivation; Forestry; Irrigation; Water management; General equilibrium; GTAP-BIO; Indirect land-use changes; Irrigated agriculture; Rain fed agriculture; Land use; biofuel; computable general equilibrium analysis; crop production; irrigation; land use change; rainfed agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881112225

As the name implies, in LDI the combustor operates fuel-lean without a rich front end: all of the combustion air not used for liner cooling enters through the combustor dome. To prevent local near-stoichometric regions that produce high NOx emissions, LDI relies on rapid and uniform fuel/air mixing. Therefore, understanding how and where mixing occurs in the flow field is critical to understanding the fuel/air mixing. So far, only time-averaged and root-mean-square (RMS) values have been used to study the fuel/air mixing. Experimentally measured RMS values are nearly as high as the mean values, i.e., the turbulence intensity is near 100%. However, this high turbulence intensity may be caused not by high levels of small-scale turbulent fluctuations but instead by coherent turbulent structures. Coherent structures have been found in time-accurate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of LDI. Therefore, in order to fully understand fuel/air mixing in LDI, a quantitative method for analyzing the observed turbulent fluctations and coherent structures needs to be developed. A reasonable candidate for such an analysis tool is proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). This paper applies POD on one time series of LDI flame luminosity images and demonstrates that POD is indeed an appropriate technique for analyzing coherent structures in LDI.",,"Aircraft engines; Combustion; Combustors; Computational fluid dynamics; Data handling; Fuels; Mixing; NASA; Nitrogen oxides; Principal component analysis; Turbulence; Appropriate techniques; Combustion technology; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Lean direct injections; Proper orthogonal decompositions; Root mean square values; Turbulence intensity; Turbulent fluctuation; Direct injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943369267

In addition to former analyses of grain-size distributions, carbonate and clay content, the sedimentary structures were investigated, a pilot study of gamma-ray measurements on the field was carried out, and several orders of cyclicity were demonstrated. Palaeontological data from earlier studies were collected and analyzed, and magnetic polarity of the rocks was measured. The Tihany, Fehérpart section is correlated with the Spiniferites tihanyensis dinoflagellate, the MN11 micromammal and the Lymnocardium decorum littoral mollusc biozones. With the exception of the lowermost few metres, it shows normal magnetic polarity. It is underlain by open lacustrine, reverse polarity shales of the Congeria praerhomboidea zone, and is overlain by layers indicative of the Prosodacnomya zone. The latter is well definied by the radiometric age (7.9 Ma) of the overlying volcanosedimentary suite. Therefore the Fehérpart section was deposited either 8.1-8.0 Ma (C4n.2n) or 8.3-8.2 Ma (C4r.1n chron) ago. The Tihany Formation was deposited in a variety of palaeoenvironments related to deltas entering Lake Pannon. It consists of parasequences, i.e. shallowing up successions from below wave base to lake level, generated by sediment accumulation. Parasequences were formed on the delta front or in inter-distributary bays to delta-plain swamps and distributary channels. Beyond the high frequency lake-level and partly autocyclic environmental fluctuations, most likely climatically induced fourth-order lake-level changes of about 15-30 m amplitude occurred, resulting in minor transgressions followed by repeated progradation of deltaic lobes. Although the Tihany (as well as the very alike Somló) Formation is currently found along the rim of the hills, it was originally deposited in the same way as the Újfalu Formation known only from the subsurface of deep basins. The dynamics of deltaic settings feeding to Lake Pannon can be understood by studying the Tihany Formation in outcrops. The only difference between the two formations might be in the number of overlying delta cycles and their thickness; both were determined by rate of subsidence, being smaller at basement highs where Tihany Formation accumulated than at basin areas where Újfalu Formation was defined. It is suggested here to include the Tihany (and Somló) beds as members of the Újfalu Formation. Fourth-order sequence boundaries were recognized between the overlying progradational deltaic bodies. In the vicinity of Tihany no evidences of lake-level drops were revealed, but elsewhere small incised-valley fills point to minor lake-level drops. The overall regression, interrupted by transgressive events, continued in the study area until the shelf edge of Lake Pannon shifted as far to the south as 50-60 km, i.e. at about 8 Ma ago. After that, flooding events became rare and small in amplitude, then the area became a terrestrial plain. Fluvial deposits are not known from the direct vicinity, but travertines formed in small freshwater ponds fed by karst springs. The transition from lacustrine to terrestrial palaeo-environments is part of the overall normal regression as a result of high sediment input to Lake Pannon. Large incised valleys or other evidences of recurring terrestrial conditions which could be related to thirdorder sequence boundaries mappable all over the Pannonian Basin were identified neither in Tihany nor in Újfalu Formation.","Delta progradation; Lake Pannon; Lithostratigraphy; Parasequence; Sequence boundary; Stage pannonian/pontian",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875604059

It is structured in four sections; in the first section cool white or light colored materials i.e. materials characterized by high solar reflectance and high infrared emittance are defined. Typical values of the two properties are given according to independent studies, the U.S. Cool Roof Rating Council's database and the IEE Cool Roofs project database. The impact of solar reflectance and infrared emittance on the surface temperature is explained and performance examples according to experimental results are compiled. The second section focuses on the types of cool white colored materials that are commercially available per roof type. These include build up roofs, single ply membranes, modified bitumen, tiles, coatings, metal roofs etc. A short description of each technology is given and their main characteristics are reported. The benefits of using cool white colored materials on buildings and the urban environment are analyzed in the third section. The benefits include increased thermal comfort conditions in buildings, reduced cooling energy consumption and peak electricity loads, increased life span of the roof system, reduction of the air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation of the heat island effect. Each one of these benefits will be supported by experimental and simulation data available in the bibliography. Finally, the problem of ageing is analyzed. Exposure of cool materials to outdoor conditions has the effect of changing their main properties: solar reflectance and infrared emittance, compromising their performance. The main mechanisms (photo-degradation, thermal stress, deposition of pollutants etc.) that are responsible for causing the ageing effect of the materials are reported. Experimental results that estimate the aging effect of various types of materials and for several outdoor conditions are presented. The case of artificial and natural ageing is discussed as well as any effort to model the ageing effect of cool materials. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.","Cool roofs; Optical properties; White cool materials",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884847627

The aim is to achieve this without compromising vehicle performance, durability or cost. Passenger car manufacturers worldwide are looking at various ways to optimize fuel economy performance. One option is for a vehicle OEM to re-design engine componentry in an effort to reduce engine friction and thereby reduce tailpipe emissions. There is also an increased focus on the crankcase lubricant as a potential tool to improve engine efficiency. This has led to a close collaborative working model between equipment manufacturers and engine oil marketers to create state of the art fluids capable of delivering higher fuel economy benefits without compromising engine durability. This paper describes a structured approach to the design of an advanced engine oil for a diesel passenger car. The aim of this formulation was to deliver a tangible improvement in fuel efficiency whilst maintaining a high level of engine durability. A carefully designed matrix of crankcase fluids was developed with the intention of investigating the relative effect of key lubricant parameters on fuel efficiency. The fuel economy impact of these formulations was assessed using a vehicle running an industry standard emissions drive cycle on a chassis dynamometer. Selected oils were then taken forward for durability evaluation using an engine test bed. The results of the testing showed that this approach to the design and development of an advanced crankcase lubricant can offer a significant improvement in fuel efficiency without compromising durability when compared to conventional oils.

Increasingly important, due to the availability and price, are processes based on the suspension of various wastes such as fly ash, cement dust or furnace slag. Due to the complexity of the mineral sequestration of CO2 in water-waste suspensions, an important issue is to determine the reaction mechanisms. This applies mainly to the initial period of the transformation phase of mineral wastes, and consequently with the occurrence of a number of transition states of ionic equilibria. The mechanisms and reaction rates in the various stages of the process of CO2 mineral sequestration in heterogeneous systems containing selected wastes are defined herein. This paper presents a method of modeling kinetics of this type of process, developed on the basis of the results of the absorption of CO2 thanks to the aqueous suspension of fly ash and cement dust. This allowed for the transfer of obtained experimental results into the mathematical formula, using the invariant function method, used to describe the processes. © 2013 Central Mining Institute","cement dust; CO2 sequestration; invariant function",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055109203

In this regard, Oceansat-2 is the second in the series of Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Satellite which was launched on 23 September 2009 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Department of Space (DOS), Government of India which is currently providing wind speed and direction data (www.nrsc.gov.in) over the globe with two days repeativity. In this study, a sample Oceansat-2 winds have been compared and correlated with a selected RAMA (The Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Austrellian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction) buoy measurements (www.pmel.noaa.gov) in the Indian Ocean by colocating both the data in space and time. The results are quite encouraging. Such comparisons of satellite measurements with the sea truth from available locations are highly essential for validating the space borne measurements which are required for understanding the physics of the oceans, spatio-temporal variability over the oceans and predicting the atmospreric weather as well as the ocean environment, besides various other research and civilian applications. © Research India Publications.","NOAA - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; NRSC - National Remote Sensing Centre; PMEL - Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory","buoy system; climate prediction; comparative study; data set; marine atmosphere; monsoon; NOAA satellite; research and development; sensor; spatiotemporal analysis; wind velocity; Africa; Asia; Australia; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878493300

Being a small island developing state, Mauritius is also highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Solar energy, which is clean, inexhaustible and environmentally friendly, has emerged as a promising renewable energy source for power generation. This study was therefore initiated to assess the potential of using photovoltaic (PV) panels in a typical Mauritian household, mainly for a middle income family. The average monthly peak electricity demand of a middle income family was 171 kWh with base load of 0.3 kW. The most appropriate PV system was found to be a 1.2 kW system where 25% of the solar power produced would meet the household needs and the rest would be fed to the grid. The payback was found to be 5.34 years at a feed in tariff (FiT) of $0.70/kWh. Environmentally, such systems would save 2.60 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually and would also reduce the load on the utility grid, as part of the power would be generated by the customers.

The research in this paper sponsored by US DoE is focused towards developing a Tier 2 Bin 2 Emissions compliant light duty pickup truck with class leading fuel economy targets of 22.4 mpg ""City"" / 34.3 mpg ""Highway"". Many advanced technologies comprising both engine and after-treatment systems are essential towards accomplishing this goal. The objective of this paper would be to discuss key engine technology enablers that will help in achieving the target emission levels and fuel economy. Several enabling technologies comprising air-handling, fuel system and base engine design requirements will be discussed in this paper highlighting both experimental and analytical evaluations. Mostly, this paper will focus on steady-state emissions and fuel consumption results that are tied to operating duty cycle with actual vehicle comparisons wherever applicable. GT-Power 1D cycle simulation analysis was done to narrow the turbocharger and air-handling architecture evaluation. The importance of turbocharger matching is critical to achieving both power density and emission goals. This paper highlights the challenges involved in selecting a single stage variable geometry turbocharger capable of delivering a 75hp/liter power density in addition to meeting light duty drive cycle emission requirements. The benefits of low pressure [LP] and high pressure [HP] EGR systems for this light-duty engine architecture will be explored in detail along with outlining the possible strategy of dual loop EGR to reduce overall fuel consumption. On the combustion system development, this paper will highlight the importance of compression ratio, variable swirl architecture, injector nozzle hardware and injection strategy optimization towards meeting the stringent emissions, fuel consumption and noise targets. Fundamental thermodynamic explanations relating the fuel consumption improvements back to closed cycle and open cycle work are also being presented. Also, the paper will discuss challenges involving unburned HC and CO emissions when operating in premixed/low temperature combustion like regimes involving higher EGR rates and early pilot injection timings.

Previous numerical simulations of the Rock Springs Uplift site (southwest Wyoming, USA) relied on a generalized regional database to populate a homogenous rock/fluid volume based on average reservoir properties. The results from this approach yielded general insights into injection/storage characteristics but lacked specificity, resulting in performance assessments plagued by substantial uncertainty. To move from idealistic, highly generalized assessments to realistic, low-risk assessments of the Rock Springs Uplift, it was necessary to acquire high-resolution data specific to the storage site of interest (carbonate and sandstone reservoirs, and confining layers in an 8 km × 8 km area). The foundation of the new database is a 4,000-meter-deep stratigraphic test well, an 8 km × 8 km 3-D seismic survey, 290 meters of high-quality core, a specialized log suite, fluid samples, and a diverse set of analytical laboratory measurements. These data made it possible to correlate seismic attributes with observations from log suites, a VSP survey, core, fluid samples, and laboratory analyses, including continuous permeability scans. From seismic data, 3-D spatial distribution volumes of reservoir and confining layer properties were constructed that represent geological heterogeneity at the targeted CO2 storage site. Consequently, the latest numerical simulations and performance assessments are characterized by substantially lower geological uncertainties. The new CO 2 plume migration simulations for a set of defined CO2 injection rates and volumes occupy larger rock/fluid volumes and display pronounced marginal irregularities when compared to early simulations derived from homogenous reservoir parameter volumes. The spatial distributions of the injected CO2 plumes in previous simulations are conical with few marginal irregularities, whereas in the new simulations, the CO2 plumes occupy a larger up-dip volume and display pronounced marginal irregularities. These irregularities denote zones of higher porosity and permeability, such as collapsed breccias associated with karst zones and/or dolomitized grainstone zones in the Madison Limestone. Using the new numerical simulations which include heterogeneous rock/fluid parameter distributions, it is apparent that in all injection/storage scenarios of &gt; 1 Mt/year CO 2, substantial displaced fluid production/treatment is essential to manage pressure and maintain the integrity of confining layers. The total dissolved solids concentrations of the formation fluids retrieved from the Madison Limestone range from 80,000 to 90,000 ppm, and will necessitate customized water treatment strategies and facilities at the surface. The new data and upgraded evaluations demonstrate that the Rock Springs Uplift in southwestern Wyoming remains an outstanding large-scale geological 2storage site, and provides a realistic basis for designing commercial CO2 injection/storage operations on the Uplift. The 2010 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program reports that in the Greater Green River Basin of southwest Wyoming, the CO 2emissions from stationary sources (sources that emit more than 25,000 tons of CO2 per year) total 29+ million tons annually, or approximately 50 percent of Wyoming's annual CO2 emissions. These CO 2sources include coal-fired power plants, gas and trona processing plants, pipeline compression stations, chemical production facilities, and gas-field complexes, among others. The Rock Springs Uplift in the center of the Greater Green River Basin is ideally located to serve as a large-scale commercial geological CO2 storage facility for half of all of Wyoming's industrial CO2emissions. The new numerical simulations suggest that the Madison Limestone has the ability to permanently store the annual CO 2 emissions from stationary sources in the Greater Green River Basin for 130 years (i.e., a total of 3.8 billion tons). The overlying Paleozoic Weber Sandstone on the Rock Springs Uplift has additional commercial-scale CO 2 storage capacity. The Rock Springs Uplift has the attributes to serve as a regional CO2 storage site, and importantly, this site could be used as a storage/surge tank to supply CO2 to EOR projects throughout Wyoming.","Separated by semicolons; Type your keywords here",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897540590

If finalized, this proposal would establish more stringent vehicle tailpipe emissions standards and reduce the allowable sulfur content of gasoline beginning in 2017. The proposal follows the approach of previous standards; coupling new requirements for motor vehicle manufacturers along with requirements for fuel producers. The logic is that a lower gasoline sulfur standard would make emission control systems more effective for both existing and new vehicles, and would enable more stringent vehicle emissions standards. Low sulfur levels in gasoline would reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from gasoline combustion. SO2 contributes to acid rain, smog, and particulate matter. Sulfur in gasoline also decreases the lifetime and effectiveness of a vehicle's selective catalytic converters used to control tailpipe emissions. Thus, lowering gasoline sulfur levels helps motor vehicle manufacturers meet the increased control technology effectiveness requirements also included in the proposed rule. U.S. EPA expects these new standards to significantly reduce pollutants such as ozone, particulate matter, and air toxics nationwide and will assist state and local agencies in attaining and maintaining the health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Mobile sources, such as motor vehicles, continue to be significant contributors to air pollution in areas not achieving the NAAQS.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902484838

Herein, the optical properties of neutral red in response to its abasic site (AP site) binding were investigated for this purpose. At pH 8.4, neutral red exists in solution mainly at the neutral form (NR). However, the presence of an AP site in DNA converts NR to a protonated form (NRH +), following a 100-nm red shift in absorption spectra. This conversion is inefficient for the fully matched DNAs without the AP site. Relative to the absorption spectra, the fluorescence in response to the binding-switched conversion is more dependent on the sequences near the AP site. The AP site's hydrophobic microenvironment and electron transfer between the AP site-bound NRH+ in excited state and the nearby context bases govern the emission behavior. It was found that the AP site having a large void space favors occurrence of dipole interaction between the bound NRH+ and the context bases. This AP site-dependent conversion of neutral red in structure and then its optical properties would find wide applications in the field of DNA assay with a high selectivity and sensitivity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Abasic site; Absorption; DNA; Fluorescence; Neutral red; Switch","Abasic site; Dipole interaction; Electron transfer; Emission behavior; Microenvironments; Neutral Red; Structure and properties; Structure conversion; Absorption; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Fluorescence; Optical properties; Switches; DNA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881309775

PM 2.5 chemical composition may be responsible for effects of exposure to PM2.5. Methods. Using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) collected in 2000-2002 on 6,256 US adults without clinical cardiovascular disease in six U.S. metropolitan areas, we investigated cross-sectional associations of estimated long-term exposure to total PM 2.5 mass and PM2.5 components (elemental carbon [EC], organic carbon [OC], silicon and sulfur) with measures of subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium [CAC] and right common carotid intima-media thickness [CIMT]). Community monitors deployed for this study from 2007 to 2008 were used to estimate exposures at baseline addresses using three commonly-used approaches: (1) nearest monitor (the primary approach), (2) inverse-distance monitor weighting and (3) city-wide average. Results: Using the exposure estimate based on nearest monitor, in single-pollutant models, increased OC (effect estimate [95% CI] per IQR: 35.1 μm [26.8, 43.3]), EC (9.6 μm [3.6,15.7]), sulfur (22.7 μm [15.0,30.4]) and total PM 2.5 (14.7 μm [9.0,20.5]) but not silicon (5.2 μm [-9.8,20.1]), were associated with increased CIMT; in two-pollutant models, only the association with OC was robust to control for the other pollutants. Findings were generally consistent across the three exposure estimation approaches. None of the PM measures were positively associated with either the presence or extent of CAC. In sensitivity analyses, effect estimates for OC and silicon were particularly sensitive to control for metropolitan area. Conclusion: Employing commonly-used exposure estimation approaches, all of the PM2.5 components considered, except silicon, were associated with increased CIMT, with the evidence being strongest for OC; no component was associated with increased CAC. PM2.5 chemical components, or other features of the sources that produced them, may be important in determining the effect of PM exposure on atherosclerosis. These cross-sectional findings await confirmation in future work employing longitudinal outcome measures and using more sophisticated approaches to estimating exposure. © 2013 Sun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Air pollution; Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular diseases; Coronary artery disease; Particulate matter","carbon; organic carbon; silicon; sulfur; air pollutant; particulate matter; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; chemical composition; data acquisition; health survey; metropolitan area; particulate matter; silicon; sulfur; adult; aged; arterial wall thickness; article; atherosclerosis; coronary artery calcium score; disease association; exposure; female; human; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; particulate matter; priority journal; air pollutant; arterial wall thickness; atherosclerosis; chemically induced; cohort analysis; coronary blood vessel; cross-sectional study; environmental monitoring; ethnic group; exposure; middle aged; particulate matter; pathophysiology; prevalence; regression analysis; United States; Vascular Calcification; very elderly; United States; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Atherosclerosis; Carotid Intima-Media Thickness; Cohort Studies; Coronary Vessels; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Monitoring; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Male; Middle Aged; Particulate Matter; Prevalence; Regression Analysis; United States; Vascular Calcification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878334566

This study, as part of the U.S. Department of Energy sponsored research program, is focused on advanced turbocharger technologies that can improve turbocharger efficiency on customer driving cycles while extending the operation range significantly, compared to a production turbocharger. The production turbocharger for a medium-duty truck application was selected as a donor turbo. Design optimizations were focused on the compressor impeller and turbine wheel. On the compressor side, advanced impeller design with arbitrary surface can improve the efficiency and surge margin at low end while extending the flow capacity, while a so-called active casing treatment can provide additional operation range extension without compromising compressor efficiency. On the turbine side, mixed flow turbine technology was revisited with renewed interest due to its performance characteristics, i.e. high efficiency at lowspeed ratio, relative to the base conventional radial flow turbine, which is relevant to heavy EGR operation for future diesel applications. The engine dynamometer test shows that the advanced turbocharger technology enables over 3% BSFC improvement at partload as well as full-load condition, in addition to an increase in rated power.

The corrosion rates were measured under high temperature and high pressure condition. SEM, EDS and XRD were used to analyze the morphologies and characteristics of corrosion scales on the steels. The results shows that the corrosion rates of 25CrMnVA steel change little below 65°C, the corrosion feature is uniform corrosion. The corrosion rates increase rapidly after 65°C, mesa corrosion is found on the surface of steel. The corrosion rates decrease firstly and increase subsequently with the rising of CO2 partial pressure, and the minimal corrosion rate presents near CO2 critical pressure. The compactness of corrosion scale improves with the increase of CO2 partial pressure below 8MPa, which causes uniform corrosion rate reduced. Under supercritical CO2 condition, the local defects in the surface of corrosion scale increase, and the compactness of corrosion scale reduces, which cause the increase of corrosion rate sharply. The corrosion rate and corrosion morphology are closely related to the state of corrosion scale. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","25CrMnVa steel; CO2; Corrosion; Corrosion scale; Local corrosion; Supercritical CO2","Corrosion behavior; Corrosion morphology; Corrosion scale; Critical pressures; Enhanced oil recovery; High temperature and high pressure; Local corrosion; Supercritical CO; Carbon dioxide; Corrosion; Corrosive effects; Enhanced recovery; Manufacture; Oil fields; Partial pressure; Surface defects; Corrosion rate",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886411942

More than half of the world's population lives in, and more than half of the world's economic output comes from, cities. Up to 70% of global carbon emissions can also be attributed to consumption that takes place in cities. Recent research has shown that cost-effective investments in low-carbon options could deliver a 40% reduction in GHG emissions from cities by 2020, while also providing wider economic benefits such as enhanced competitiveness and increased employment. As yet, however, investments in low-carbon cities have not been made at scale due mainly to the scale of the finance required, local government budgetary constraints, and perceptions about their costs and benefits. With a focus on the UK, a contemporary account is provided of what local authorities see as the major financial risks associated with funding low-carbon cities. Practical proposals - which also have more general relevance to the future financing of low-carbon cities around the world - are offered on how local authorities, in conjunction with central government, the private sector, and institutional investors, can effectively manage these risks. Policy relevance Cities house more than half of the world's population, generate more than half of the world's economic output, and produce between 40% and 70% of all anthropogenic GHG emissions. In the UK, 70% of such emissions are under the influence of its local authorities. Thus, one of the key public policy challenges for the low-carbon transition is how it should be financed. There are several obstacles and related risks to this transition, including financial and legal obstacles and the differing views and perceptions of stakeholders. These can be attenuated, somewhat, by national government support at scale, local authority leadership, and cooperation between other authorities and the private sector, and the development of tools and guidance to reduce transaction costs. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","climate finance; local government; low-carbon cities; low-carbon investment; public policy","abatement cost; carbon emission; competitiveness; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; employment generation; environmental economics; governance approach; local government; policy approach; transaction cost; urban area; urban pollution; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879549999

The purpose of the chemical speciation analysis was to use the speciation data, together with meteorological data and hourly TEOM (tapered element oscillating microbalance) PM2.5 mass data, to identify the causes of the high PM2.5 concentrations affecting the monitoring site and the neighborhood. The ultimate purpose was to target emission reduction efforts to sources contributing to the high measured PM2.5 concentrations. After a year of data collection, it was recognized that a specific source, unpaved driveways and loading areas along the Ship Channel and dirt tracked onto Clinton Drive, the main artery running east-west north of the Ship Channel, were the primary cause for the Clinton Drive site's measuring PM2.5 concentrations significantly higher than other sites in Houston. The source characterization and remediation steps that have led to sustained reduced concentrations are described in this paper. With PM2.5 exceedances it can be essential to have or develop chemical speciation data as part of the process of identifying the source types causing exceedances of an annual standard. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis proved to be a powerful tool that identified the two locally emitted species contributing to exceedances, which did not occur at other sites in the region. They were calcium sulfate (gypsum), an industrial by-product, and soil minerals. Other data analysis approaches were necessary to distinguish North African dust events, which PMF failed to identify. © 2013 Copyright 2012 A&amp;WMA.",,"Calcium compounds; Chemical speciation; Digital storage; Emission control; Factorization; Filtration; Meteorology; Quality control; Ships; Sulfate minerals; Fine particulate matter; Industrial by-products; Meteorological data; PM2.5 concentration; Positive Matrix Factorization; Source characterization; Tapered element oscillating microbalances; Texas Commission on Environmental Quality; Chemical analysis; ammonium sulfate; calcium sulfate; carbon; nickel; sodium chloride; sodium sulfate; vanadium; article; chemical analysis; combustion; environmental monitoring; field study; filter; fire; motor vehicle; neighborhood; particulate matter; priority journal; soil; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883374032

As paddy rice cropland in Thailand accounts for 52% of all cultivated land in the country and 6% of the world's rice paddies, accurately estimating emissions from rice paddies has become important in this country for GHG inventories or mitigation policies. This research integrated biogeochemical models with remote sensing technology to advance the DNDC regional application. This research identified spatio-temporal patterns of GHG emissions (COz, CH4, and NzO) from rice fields in Thailand (Lopburi province). New Method and database system were developed to increase accuracy of DNDC model; moreover, spatial and temporal characteristics of phenological information derived from remote sensing data (MODIS) were used in DNDC to quantify emissions. The results demonstrate the influence of human management, climate variation, and physical geography on the change of GHG emissions. Phenology of rice and human management were the major factors effecting the changes of CH4 emissions. The change of COz emissions showed rapid changes in extreme climate years. NzO emission was strongly related to climate variation, especially rainfall changes. Rice intensification with longer length of flooding period and high application rates of fertilizer extremely enhanced CH4 production. Light soil texture produces higher emission than heavy soil texture. The results suggest that practical mitigation options should be carefully regulated to more efficiently balance among the emission types as well as to maintain or improve grain yields.","Agroecosystem; DNDC; GHG emissions; Phenology; Remote Sensing; Rice; Thailand","Agro ecosystems; DNDC; GHG emission; Phenology; Rice; Thailand; Agriculture; Biology; Climate change; Database systems; Methane; Rain; Remote sensing; Soils; Textures; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888870352

A two-cylinder variant of the SCCCE is modeled using Caterpillar's one-dimensional modeling software DYNASTY, following the geometric and boundary specifications given by the University of Pisa in their paper by Musu et al. (2010, ""Clean Diesel Combustion by Means of the HCPC Concept,"" SAE Paper No. 2010-01-1256). The results are compared to validate our modeling methodology. The split cycle clean combustion (SCCC) concept may significantly reduce gaseous and particulate emissions while maintaining high engine efficiency compared to the current state of the art diesel engine. Some manufacturers have been prototyping gasoline engines based on the SCCC concept, but there are no diesel fuel powered SCCC engine prototypes existing in the market. This study will be a significant contribution in the performance evaluation of SCCC diesel engines at high load and part load conditions. A one-dimensional modeling technique was chosen for this study due to the need of a fast running model that could be improved using design of experiments (DOE) analysis. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling produces more accurate results but limits one's ability to model a large number of configurations due to its large computational overhead that slows down the overall simulation process, thus making CFD models not feasible for this DOE. In order to accurately model an SCCC engine, we first validated our modeling methodology by reproducing results of the CFD based model presented by University of Pisa in Musu et al. (2010, ""Clean Diesel Combustion by Means of the HCPC Concept,"" SAE Paper No. 2010-01-1256). A satisfactory comparison of results confirmed our modeling approach and enabled us to integrate more complex models that will be discussed in future publications.

When oxygen tension is not high enough to oxidise reduced substrates to CO2 and water through respiration in mitochondria, most organisms rely on anaerobic glycolysis to obtain energy. The utilisation of glucose is higher under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. Cancer cells require energy to support their rapid rates of division and the more slowly dividing cancer cells in the hypoxic regions of tumours too require energy to survive. Many cancer cells exhibit, relative to normal cells, increased glucose transport and glycolysis, because energy can also be generated by glycolysis in the absence of oxygen. Moreover, the increased uptake of glucose is one of the most common signs of a highly malignant tumour. The key enzyme (hexokinase-II) of anaerobic glycolysis in cancer cells was inhibited by metabolic poisons such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose and 3-bromopyruvate using molecular docking programme ArgusLab. The efficiency of these compounds was also compared with its analogues. Consequently, the potent compound could also be used to treat the cancer cells.

This energy crisis is expected to persist for an indefinite period in the region unless immediate actions are taken to reverse the trend. Although global aspiration to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere is high, such desire is low in SSA. Regional stakeholders are more worried about increasing power generation capacity to enhance better access to different sorts of development. To progress in line with advanced patterns of energy development globally, to increase the availability of electrical energy and to sustain emissions reductions, exploitation of local renewable energy (RE) resources is inevitable. Consequently, this paper presents a comprehensive review of RE integration for expanding access to electricity in SSA. The review covers the sustainability of RE resources in SSA, the regional status of RE applications and the necessity of RE power generation integration planning from a management aspect.

The mean annual temperatures (MATs) estimated by LMA and CLAMP are 17.4 ± 3.3 C and 17.4 ± 1.3 C, respectively, compared with 15.9 C at present. Meanwhile, the growing season precipitation (GSP) estimated by CLAMP is 1735.5 ± 217.7 mm in the Longmen flora, compared with 986.9 mm nowadays. The calculated monsoon intensity index (MSI) of the Longmen flora is significantly lower than that of today. These results appear consistent with previous studies on the late Pliocene floras in western Yunnan based on the coexistence approach (CA), and further suggest that there was a slightly warmer and much wetter climate during the late Pliocene than the present climate in western Yunnan. We conclude that the significant change of the monsoonal climate might have been resulted from the continuous uplift of mountains in western Yunnan, as well as the intensification of the eastern Asian winter monsoon, both occurring concurrently in the post-Pliocene period. © Author(s) 2013.",,"coexistence; flora; growing season; monsoon; paleoclimate; paleoecology; paleotemperature; Pliocene; precipitation (climatology); China; Yongping; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882769508

A major assumption used in recent cloud- and climate-modeling studies is that all sea spray was emitted uniformly into some oceanic grid boxes, and thus these studies did not account for subgrid aerosol coagulation within the sea-spray plumes. We explore the evolution of these sea-salt plumes using a multi-shelled Gaussian plume model with size-resolved aerosol coagulation. We determine how the final number of particles depends on meteorological conditions, including wind speed and boundary-layer stability, as well as the emission rate and size distribution of aerosol emitted. Under previously proposed injection rates and typical marine conditions, we find that the number of aerosol particles is reduced by over 50%, but this reduction varies from under 10% to over 90% depending on the conditions. We provide a computationally efficient parameterization for cloud-resolving and global-scale models to account for subgrid-scale coagulation, and we implement this parameterization in a global-scale aerosol-climate model. While designed to address subgrid-scale coagulation of sea-salt particles, the parameterization is generally applicable for coagulation of subgrid-scale aerosol from point sources. We find that accounting for this subgrid-scale coagulation reduces cloud droplet number concentrations by 46% over emission regions, and reduces the global mean radiative flux perturbation from -1.5 W m-2 to -0.8 W m-2. © 2013 Author(s).",,"aerosol; albedo; cloud droplet; cloud microphysics; cloud seeding; coagulation; marine atmosphere; parameterization; particle size; sea salt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886828367

Its diurnal evolution is used in the present study in conjunction with other ground-based and satellite data to develop a top-down emission estimate of the annual CO emission of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). The growth-rate of the total column around noon under low ventilation conditions is calculated and allows us to derive the average surface emission-flux at UNAM, while similar measurements taken at the edge of the MCMA in Tecámac provide information on background CO levels in the Mexico basin. Based on 3 yr of measurements, CO column measurements from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) satellite instrument are used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of this anthropogenic pollutant over the MCMA. The agreement between the measured columns of the satellite and ground-based measurements is excellent, particularly when a comparison strategy based on time-displaced air masses is used. The annual emission of the Mexico Megacity is estimated to be (2.15 ± 0.5) Tg yr-1 for the year 2008, while the official inventory for that year reported 1.6 Tg yr -1. The difference is slightly higher than the conservative uncertainty estimated in this work suggesting that the emission might be underestimated by the conventional bottom-up method. A larger discrepancy is found in the spatial distribution of the emissions, when comparing the emission flux over UNAM (derived from the ground-based measurement) with that of the inventory integrated over a representative area. The methodology presented here represents a new and useful strategy to evaluate the contribution of megacities to the global anthropogenic gas emissions. Additionally, three different strategies to compare ground and space-based measurements above an inhomogeneous and strongly contaminated area like Mexico City are presented and discussed. © Author(s) 2013.",,"atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; emission inventory; FTIR spectroscopy; metropolitan area; spatial distribution; urban pollution; ventilation; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico [North America]; Mexico City",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873527973

Due to erroneous positioning solutions, the existing AGD prototype often proposes inappropriate maneuvers to the driver. This avoids a successful market entry of the existing green driving application. To remove this limitation new positioning strategies for low-cost GNSS receivers will be implemented in GAIN. These approaches have a special focus on integrity issues in order to prevent the application from taking misleading decisions. That refined positioning algorithm will be introduced in this paper. The proposed positioning solution is based on Galileo/GPS and EGNOS/EDAS.

The need for replacement of old capacities and closure of Ignalina NPP is an extremely important driving force for transformation, making conventional and new technologies compete for a role in the future energy supply in Lithuania. Lithuania adopted national energy independence strategy in 2012 where construction of new NPP is being considered as the main way to increase energy independence however for Lithuanian population the prices of district heat is the major problem therefore the alternative measures are necessary seeking to solve the problem of energy independence and high district heat prices. One possible development path of energy sector is decentralization of the electricity system. Distributed power generation in small, decentralized units could help to reduce emissions, save grid capacity and provide opportunities for renewable energy. It could be a constituent part of a more sustainable energy future. There are several available technologies for implementation of CHP in buildings. These technologies need to be assessed by taking into account economic, environmental and social criteria. Comparative assessment of these technologies in terms of sustainability and to define the most sustainable one. The multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are the celebrated techniques employed for suchlike assessments and can by applied for this task as provides assessment of technologies based on quantitative, qualitative indicators and also allows to tackle with uncertainties when ranges of values for indicators are available. The aim of the paper is to compare the main small scale CHP technologies for buildings and to rank them according the main criteria of sustainability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Buildings; Comparative assessment; Small CHP; Sustainability","Comparative assessment; Electricity system; Energy independence; Multi-criteria assessment; Multi-criteria decision making; Renewable energies; Small CHP; Strong dependences; Buildings; Distributed power generation; Energy policy; Sustainable development; Technology; Environmental technology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879288497

Although rewetting and restoration following peat extraction have taken place over the last several decades, very few studies have investigated the longer term impact of this restoration on peatland carbon balance. We determined the annual carbon balance of a former horticulturally-extracted peatland restored 10 yr prior to the study and compared these values to the carbon balance measured at neighboring unrestored and natural sites. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were measured using the chamber technique biweekly during the growing season from May to October 2010 and three times over the winter period. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export was measured from remnant ditches in the unrestored and restored sites. During the growing season the restored site had greater uptake of CO2 than the natural site when photon flux density was greater than 1000 μmolm-2 s-1, while the unrestored site remained a source of CO2. Ecosystem respiration was similar between natural and restored sites, which were both significantly lower than the unrestored site. Methane flux remained low at the restored site except from open water pools, created as part of restoration, and remnant ditches. Export of DOC during the growing season was 5.0 and 28.8 gm-2 from the restored and unrestored sites, respectively. Due to dry conditions during the study year all sites acted as net carbon sources with annual balance of the natural, restored and unrestored sites of 250.7, 148.0 and 546.6 gCm-2, respectively. Although hydrological conditions and vegetation community at the restored site remained intermediate between natural and unrestored conditions, peatland restoration resulted in a large reduction in annual carbon loss from the system resulting in a carbon balance more similar to a natural peatland. © Author(s) 2013.",,"annual variation; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; dissolved organic carbon; greenhouse gas; horticulture; peatland; photon flux density; restoration ecology; rewetting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877855379

Model output may or may not be significantly related to observations at different times and on different frequencies. Conventional model diagnostics provide an aggregate view of model-data agreement, but usually do not identify the time and frequency patterns of model-data disagreement, leaving unclear the steps required to improve model response to environmental drivers that vary on characteristic frequencies. Wavelet coherence can quantify the times and timescales at which two time series, for example time series of models and measurements, are significantly different. We applied wavelet coherence to interpret the predictions of 20 ecosystem models from the North American Carbon Program (NACP) Site-Level Interim Synthesis when confronted with eddy-covariance-measured net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from 10 ecosystems with multiple years of available data. Models were grouped into classes with similar approaches for incorporating phenology, the calculation of NEE, the inclusion of foliar nitrogen (N), and the use of model-data fusion. Models with prescribed, rather than prognostic, phenology often fit NEE observations better on annual to interannual timescales in grassland, wetland and agricultural ecosystems. Models that calculated NEE as net primary productivity (NPP) minus heterotrophic respiration (HR) rather than gross ecosystem productivity (GPP) minus ecosystem respiration (ER) fit better on annual timescales in grassland and wetland ecosystems, but models that calculated NEE as GPP minus ER were superior on monthly to seasonal timescales in two coniferous forests. Models that incorporated foliar nitrogen (N) data were successful at capturing NEE variability on interannual (multiple year) timescales at Howland Forest, Maine. The model that employed a model-data fusion approach often, but not always, resulted in improved fit to data, suggesting that improving model parameterization is important but not the only step for improving model performance. Combined with previous findings, our results suggest that the mechanisms driving daily and annual NEE variability tend to be correctly simulated, but the magnitude of these fluxes is often erroneous, suggesting that model parameterization must be improved. Few NACP models correctly predicted fluxes on seasonal and interannual timescales where spectral energy in NEE observations tends to be low, but where phenological events, multi-year oscillations in climatological drivers, and ecosystem succession are known to be important for determining ecosystem function. Mechanistic improvements to models must be made to replicate observed NEE variability on seasonal and interannual timescales. © Author(s) 2013.

The black locust biomass was characterised by the lowest moisture content combined with the greatest lower heating value and ash content. The poplar plant had the highest carbon and hydrogen content and the greatest higher heating value, although due to its high moisture content, it had the poorest lower heating value. The willow biomass was characterised by the highest content of cellulose and holocellulose. Mycorrhiza improved the cellulose content as well as the lignin and holocellulose content in the wood of the black locust.

In agrometeorology, response farming has been developed decades ago. Climate change complicates response farming, but does not alter it. This paper reports on new operationalization of that response farming in new educational commitments in agroclimatology. It is explained how ""Science Field Shops"" are an example in Indonesia. This was based on a thorough analysis of what climate change means for farmers in Asia. For Africa, we report on eying the training of agrometeorological extension trainers (""product intermediaries"") in West Africa, based on a thorough analysis of what climate change means for farmers in Africa. We also compare experience with reaching farmers in South Africa and farmer communities in Zambia, as new forms of supporting response farming, all under conditions of a changing climate. The paper, for the first time, connects results from four different programs the senior author is taking part in.

A dynamical model evaluation shows that the modeling framework is able to capture the changes in both magnitude and spatio-temporal structure of ozone concentrations over the 20-year period. We model ozone formation for four episodes, which both capture the observed changes in ozone reduction and the different meteorological regimes that occur during LFV ozone episodes. The SMOKE emission inventories are adjusted to account for temporal changes in amount, and location of emissions, based on population shifts. Model runs allow us to isolate the effects of emission changes from meteorological changes. Results show that the western LFV has been, and remains VOC-sensitive; the central LFV has changed from VOC-limited to NOx-limited; and the eastern LFV has been, and remains NOx-limited. Analysis shows that the ozone production efficiency as a function of NO has increased noticeably in the eastern LFV.

Because there appears to be little or no impact from precursor emissions upwind of the LFV during ozone episodes and because background concentrations of ozone and its precursors are generally from the North Pacific Ocean and quite low, summertime ozone formation in the LFV is mostly caused by local emissions. The observed change in behaviour of ozone formation must, therefore, arise from reductions in local precursor emissions. We exploit the observed changing precursor emission- ozone concentration relationship to perform a dynamical model evaluation. Complicating the analyses are an observed shift in the population patterns within the valley over the last 25 years and a small but documented change in the tropospheric background concentration of ozone. Ozone formation for four episodes, which capture the observed changes in ozone reduction and the different meteorological types that occur during LFV ozone events, are investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE)-Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modelling system. In order to provide realistic simulations of past events, the SMOKE emission inventory is adjusted to account for temporal changes in the amount of emissions and locations of emission sources. Model output is compared with continuous observations, data collected from field campaigns, and previous modelling efforts. The WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ modelling framework is able to capture the changes in both the magnitude of the ozone concentrations and its spatial behaviour over the period of study. Many of the simulations show that the highest ozone concentrations occur outside the area sampled by the fixed monitoring network and within the LFV's numerous tributary valleys. Not all modelled episodes achieved the same agreement with observations and some of these discrepancies are likely related to shortcomings in the meteorological modelling. The model consistently overpredicts ozone at a number of stations within the City of Vancouver and underpredicts daytime NOx concentrations there. Both results are consistent with a deficiency in NOx emissions. The model shows a changing bias over time which also suggests uncertainties in the emission backcasting.","BC; Lower Fraser Valley; Model evaluation; Ozone; Retrospective analysis","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission inventory; formation mechanism; nitrogen oxides; numerical model; observational method; ozone; point source pollution; troposphere; uncertainty analysis; British Columbia; Canada; Fraser Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879298177

In order to resolve the formation and growth of particles in these plumes, we have integrated TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) microphysics in the System for Atmospheric Modelling (SAM), a large-eddy simulation/cloud-resolving model (LES/CRM). We have evaluated this model against aircraft observations for three case studies, and the model reproduces well the major features of each case. Using this model, we have shown that meteorology and background aerosol concentrations can have strong effects on new-particle formation and growth in coal-fired power-plant plumes, even if emissions are held constant. We subsequently used the model to evaluate the effects of SO2 and NOx pollution controls on newparticle formation in coal-fired power-plant plumes. We found that strong reductions in NOx emissions without concurrent reductions in SO 2 emissions may increase new-particle formation, due to increases in OH formation within the plume. We predicted the change in new-particle formation due to changes in emissions between 1997 and 2010 for 330 coal-fired power plants in the US, and we found a median decrease of 19% in new-particle formation. However, the magnitude and sign of the aerosol changes depend greatly on the relative reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions in each plant. More extensive plume measurements for a range of emissions of SO2 and NOx and in varying background aerosol conditions are needed, however, to better quantify these effects. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.","aerosol; boundary layer; cloud condensation nuclei; nucleation; pollution; sulfate",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877343447

The target that is currently recognized by most world governments places a limit of two degrees Celsius on the global mean warming since preindustrial times. This would require large sustained reductions in carbon dioxide emissions during the twenty-first century and beyond. Such a global temperature target, however, is not sufficient to control many other quantities, such as transient sea level rise, ocean acidification and net primary production on land. Here, using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (EMIC) in an observation-informed Bayesian approach, we show that allowable carbon emissions are substantially reduced when multiple climate targets are set. We take into account uncertainties in physical and carbon cycle model parameters, radiative efficiencies, climate sensitivity and carbon cycle feedbacks along with a large set of observational constraints. Within this framework, we explore a broad range of economically feasible greenhouse gas scenarios from the integrated assessment community to determine the likelihood of meeting a combination of specific global and regional targets under various assumptions. For any given likelihood of meeting a set of such targets, the allowable cumulative emissions are greatly reduced from those inferred from the temperature target alone. Therefore, temperature targets alone are unable to comprehensively limit the risks from anthropogenic emissions. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A graphical representation of the simulation results is used to present the findings. It has been demonstrated that in specific urban contexts, zero-carbon performance as defined within the current UK compliance framework may be very difficult to achieve in practice given the assumptions used in the simulation here.

The health and wellbeing impacts of climate variability may be experienced as direct or indirect health impacts or as reduced access to health and other services as reduced economic viability affects rural towns. Identifying risk factors for vulnerability and local measures and practices that will reduce health and wellbeing impacts offers evidence for climate change adaptation policy direction at the local, state and national level. This paper discusses the results of a study that aimed to improve understanding of the vulnerability, resilience and adaptive capacity of rural communities at the household scale. Focus groups with town residents and key informant interviews were conducted in three rural towns in Western Victoria experiencing differing water security challenges during a period of ""drought"". Perceived health and wellbeing impacts and the differing ways in which residents adapted their lives to accommodate these changes were explored. The study revealed a range of physical, mental, oral health and food security impacts on health and wellbeing. There were clear gender differences in the ways that men and women identified, communicated and dealt with these impacts. Perceived water quality and cost were shown to be key determinants of acceptance of the small town reticulated water supply. The results of this study suggest that a history of conservatism, degree of community connectedness and communication, the small town ethic of self-reliance, and the openness of government to community involvement in decision making, planning and action around water supplies are important factors in determining resilience to threats to water security in small rural towns. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.","Climate change adaptation; Rural; Water security; Water use; Water-supply","Behavioral research; Decision making; Food supply; Health; Health risks; Risk assessment; Rural areas; Water quality; Water supply; Climate change adaptation; Climate variability; Community involvement; Economic viability; Farming communities; Gender differences; Water security; Water use; Climate change; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; health care; resilience; rural area; social policy; vulnerability; water quality; water supply; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892503194

During the same period, there has also been a substantial increase in the identification and promotion of ‘best practices’ in most areas of policy, including climate change. Underlying these best practices is a frequently encountered assumption that these are effective mechanisms of promoting learning amongst policy-makers and of contributing to improvements and efficiencies of policy-making and practice (Bulkeley, Environ Plan A 38(6):1029–1044, 2006). However, the reality seems to be that best practices, especially examples from afar (and from different contexts), often have only a limited role in policy-making processes: other influences are more important (Wolman and Page, Governance 15(4):477–501, 2002). This paper critically examines the use of best practices in relation to climate change, sustainability and urban policy. It begins by reviewing recent European policy documents, and examines the importance that these documents attach to the identification and dissemination of best practices. Next, the paper identifies some of the main reasons why governments have been increasingly active in developing (or claiming) innovative policies that represent best practice: reasons include image, prestige, power and funding.

The developed model is based on the methane oxidation mechanism developed previously for the case of the abundance of excited O2 molecules in the mixture and incorporates new ab initio studies of N + O2(a 1Δg) and N2 + O2(a 1Δg) reaction channels. It was revealed that the reactivity of O2(a1Δg) molecule in the reaction with atomic nitrogen is significantly smaller than that of normal ground state oxygen. Numerical simulations show that, despite this fact, the abundance of singlet delta oxygen in the CH4-air mixture results in an increase in the concentration of nitric oxide in the combustion exhaust. The major relative rise of NO concentration is observed for the fuel-lean mixture and can mount to 30% at the presence of 5% O2(a1Δ g) in molecular oxygen. This phenomenon is due to the appearance of additional amount of atomic oxygen in the flame via acceleration of chain-branching in the mixture by adding O2(a1Δ g) molecules. It is shown that, due to extending the flammability thresholds via abundance of singlet delta oxygen in the CH4-air mixture, it is possible to reduce significantly the NO emission without diminishing the flame speed. © 2012 The Combustion Institute.

The European legislation is supporting all techniques that avoid, reduce or treat CH4 emissions. One of the main directions is reducing the quantities of biodegradable waste disposed in landfills. The efforts for GHG emissions reduction and also compliance with European legislation in the field of waste management does not mean only putting in place some state of the art facilities but also to operate them in optimal conditions at design capacity. The new projects for Integrated Waste Management Systems, developed in most Romania counties, include as compulsory stage in the design of the new landfills, a gas treatment system in accordance with Directive on the landfill of waste. By treatment of the landfill gas, the CH4 is oxidized to CO2 that has a global warming potential of 21 times less than CH4. It is foreseen that these systems will be put into operation after closing the first cell that has variable life time, frequently between 6 and 8 years, meanwhile most of the generated methane will be released into the atmosphere. The legislation does not mention at what stage the landfill gas has to be collected and treated. In this way ""after cell closure"" could mean a significant delay in compliance. Various first kinetic order models of methane generation potential are briefly presented. They are widely used having advantages and drawbacks and could be used to predict the methane emission/generation before and after landfill closure.","Biodegradable; Landfill gas; Model; Romania; Waste",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891678053

Starting with 1998 a new energy law has been adopted, and Romania started the implementation of deep restructuring and reform process in the energy sector, unbundling the generation, transmission, distribution, supply activities and introducing competition on the base of specific regulations issued by an independent regulatory authority. Since 2005 the electricity and market is 100% opened for non residential customers and a new model for the Romanian Electricity Market has been introduced using price based unit commitments and the balancing market as a tool for providing in the real time the demand and supply balance. In 2007 Romania joined the European Union and implemented in the Romanian energy policy the European priorities like the 20/20/20 targets, CO2 emission reduction, renewable energy percentage and energy efficiency increase, defined by EU Commission. Starting with 2008, Transelectrica has been requested connection solutions for numerous wind farms, the installed capacity totalling much more than the country's internal consumption. These applications are being concentrated in three regions: Dobrogea, Moldova and Banat, the question of insufficient network transfer capacity was raised. Since 2010, the installed and operational capacity of wind power plants has been constantly increasing, at the beginning of this year installed capacity reached 2100 MW, most of the wind power plants (80 %) were concentrated in the Dobrogea region. A large number of projects are promoted by developers, being difficult for Transelectrica to forecast which projects will find funding and will then be finalized and which one will be abandoned at the stage of intention. In the last two years encouraged by the renewable energy promotion Law issued by the Parliament in 2008 and updated several times, we face an important development of large photovoltaic plants, recording an increased number of grid connection applications for such new generation units. This paper will present the challenges that the Romanian Transport System Operator have to deal with in the transmission network planning process and the projects for developing the grid that can be taken into account (for example: building new interconnection lines, adding Phase Shift Transformers on existing interconnections lines, new pumped storage hydropower plants for balancing purposes, partially observing N-1 criteria, sizing the grid, avoiding onerous grid costs, developing smart grids, etc.). © 2013 CIGRE.

Throughput improvements can be gained by reducing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle count, which is used in conventional DNA processing to amplify the DNA to an easily measurable amount. A Photonic Crystal (PhC) can be integrated within a microfluidic channel to enhance fluorescence emission, enabling a reduction in PCR cycling. Most PhCs are fabricated using serial top-down fabrication techniques, resulting in a structure that is challenging to integrate with microfluidic system components. Here, we present a co-integration process for fabricating a Silicon master mold consisting of a visible range PhC lattice and a microfluidic channel. This process can be used to co-fabricate microscale channel and nanoscale lattice structures in polymer or thermoplastic materials. Two-dimensional visible range PhCs are fabricated by patterning electron beam resist via E-Beam Lithography (EBL). The patterned features (100-300nm features with 200-450nm pitch) are cured to a glass-like material that is used as a directetch mask for Reactive Ion Etching. A 200μm wide and 25μm high ridge ""strip"" is fabricated around the PhC region using Photolithography and Deep RIE etching to form the completed channel & lattice mold.

A wealth of information exists about the regulation of pigment production and mixotrophic growth in various members of the Roseobacter clade, but a detailed knowledge about aerobic bacteriochlorophyll a-containing gammaproteobacteria is still limited to one strain of the species Congregibacter litoralis. Results: The production of photosynthetic pigments and light-dependent mixotrophic growth was analysed in Luminiphilus syltensis DSM 22749T, Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T and Pseudohaliea rubra DSM 19751T, representing three taxonomically diverse strains of bacteriochlorophyll a-containing gammaproteobacteria affiliated to the OM60/NOR5 clade. In these strains the expression of a photosynthetic apparatus depended mainly on the type of carbon source and availability of oxygen. The effect of illumination on pigment expression varied significantly between strains. In contrast to Chromatocurvus halotolerans, pigment production in Luminiphilus syltensis and Pseudohaliea rubra was repressed by light of moderate intensities, probably indicating a higher sensitivity to light-induced oxidative stress. The efficiency of using light for mixotrophic growth did not correlate with the cellular level of photosynthetic pigments, but depended mainly on the type of metabolized substrate with malate being the optimal carbon source in most cases. Conclusions: Oligotrophic growth conditions or carbon limitation were not required for light-dependent mixotrophic growth in members of the OM60/NOR5 clade. The ability of using light as energy source and the fine tuning of photosynthesis gene expression depended mainly on the type of carbon source and oxygen availability, which indicates that the regulation of pigment production is controlled by the cellular redox state. While light has the main impact on the regulation of photosynthetic pigments in photoheterotrophic representatives of the Roseobacter lineage this was not the case in strains of the OM60/NOR5 clade. © 2013 Spring and Riedel; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Carbon starvation; Coastal marine environment; Photoheterotrophy; Photophosphorylation; Roseobacter clade","bacteriochlorophyll a; carbon; oxygen; pigment; article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; carbon source; Chromatocurvus halotolerans; cladistics; energy resource; Gammaproteobacteria; gene expression; Luminiphilus syltensis; mixotroph; nonhuman; photosynthesis; phylogeny; Pseudohaliea rubra; taxonomy; Aquatic Organisms; Bacteriochlorophyll A; Carbon; Energy Metabolism; Gammaproteobacteria; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Light; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Photosynthesis; Alphaproteobacteria; Gammaproteobacteria; Roseobacter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878010207

Simulations was built coupling WRF-ARW meteorological model to CHIMERE v. 2008c air quality model (validated with DELTA Tool), using 2008 year as meteorological basis. For past simulation, a detailed emission inventory was done, based in a combination of the Portuguese (area sources) and Galician (EMIGAL, point and area sources) emission inventories, with EMEP inventory for the year 2008. Future simulation considers a projection of emissions depending on the maxima authorized activities in the region.

Precipitation accumulation occurs mostly during the wintertime (December-February) and during the monsoon season (July-September). Rain and snow pH levels are usually between 5-6, with crustal-derived species playing a major role in acid neutralization. These species (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+) exhibit their highest concentrations between March and June in both PM2.5 and precipitation due mostly to dust. Crustal-derived species concentrations in precipitation exhibit positive relationships with SO42-, NO3-, and Cl-, suggesting that acidic gases likely react with and partition to either crustal particles or hydrometeors enriched with crustal constituents. Concentrations of particulate SO42- show a statistically significant correlation with rain SO42- unlike snow SO42-, which may be related to some combination of the vertical distribution of SO 42- (and precursors) and the varying degree to which SO42-enriched particles act as cloud condensation nuclei versus ice nuclei in the region. The coarse : fine aerosol mass ratio was correlated with crustal species concentrations in snow unlike rain, suggestive of a preferential role of coarse particles (mainly dust) as ice nuclei in the region. Precipitation NO3-: SO42- ratios exhibit the following features with potential explanations discussed: (i) they are higher in precipitation as compared to PM2.5; (ii) they exhibit the opposite annual cycle compared to particulate NO3-: SO42- ratios; and (iii) they are higher in snow relative to rain during the wintertime. Long-term trend analysis for the monsoon season shows that the NO3-: SO42- ratio in rain increased at the majority of sites due mostly to air pollution regulations of SO42- precursors. © 2013 Author(s).",,"acid neutralization; aerosol composition; calcium; cloud condensation nucleus; concentration (composition); magnesium; particulate matter; pH; precipitation (chemistry); snow; sodium; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881225829

One way is to improve the energy production and supply side, and the other way is, in general, to reduce the consumption of energy in society. This paper has focus on the latter and especially the consumption of energy for heating and cooling our houses. There is a huge energy-saving potential in this area for reducing both the global climate problems as well as economy challenges. Heating of buildings in Denmark accounts for approximately 40% of the entire national energy consumption. For this reason, a reduction of heat losses from building envelopes are of great importance in order to reach the Bologna CO2 emission reduction targets. Upgrading of the energy performance of buildings is a topic of huge global interest these years. Not only heating in the temperate and arctic regions are important, but also air conditioning and mechanical ventilation in the ""warm countries"" contribute to an enormous energy consumption and corresponding CO2 emission. In order to establish the best basis for upgrading the energy performance, it is important to make measurements of the heat losses at different places on a building facade, in order to optimize the energy performance. This paper presents a method for measuring the heat loss by utilizing a U-value meter. The U-value meter measures the heat transfer in the unit W/Km2 and has been used in several projects to upgrade the energy performance in temperate regions. The U-value meter was also utilized in an EUDP (Energy Technological Development and Demonstration Program) focusing on renovation of houses from the 1960s and 1970s. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","CO2 emission; Energy performance; Energy reduction of buildings; Global climate; Heat loss measuring; Heat loss measuring device; Temperate regions","building; carbon emission; energy efficiency; energy policy; global climate; optimization; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886289345

Women make up a large number of the poor in communities that are highly dependent on local natural resources for their livelihood and are disproportionately vulnerable to and affected by climate change. Women's limited access to resources and decision- making processes increases their vulnerability to climate change. Women in rural areas in developing countries have the major responsibility for household water supply and energy for cooking and heating, as well as for food security, and are negatively affected by drought, uncertain rainfall and deforestation. Because of their roles, unequal access to resources and limited mobility, women in many contexts are disproportionately affected by natural disasters, such as floods, fires, and mudslides. It is important to identify gender-sensitive strategies for responding to the environmental and humanitarian crises caused by climate change. Women need renewable energy to address their critical need for cooking energy. Women need cooking energy that is less labor-using, more convenient, and safer.

The combustion and emissions characteristics were investigated at 5 bars IMEP at 1400 rpm. The ignition for DI of n-butanol-biodiesel binary blends showed a delay by approximately 7.5°CAD compared with the PFI case. For the binary mixture, n-butanol-biodiesel, the combustion pressure has decreased by 50% compared to the PFI of butanol. The maximum in cylinder gas temperature decreased by 100K for the n-butanol-biodiesel mixture versus ULSD#2 and has also experienced a 10° CAD delay. The premixed charge combustion has been split into two regions of high temperature heat release, an early one BTDC, and a second stage, ATDC for the PFI strategy. Increasing the load to 7.5 bars IMEP, heavy knock occurred for the PFI case. The soot emissions showed a 90% decrease with n-butanol injection PFI and by 98% reduction for DI of n-butanol binary mixture with the biodiesel, while the NOx emissions were reduced by 40% in both cases. The aldehyde emissions exhibited a significant 95% decrease for the n-butanol-biodiesel binary mixture compared with the n-butanol PFI. The mechanical efficiency at 80% and thermal efficiency and 38% were found similar, for both fuelling strategies. The results of this work suggest that the DI of n-butanolbiodiesel binary mixtures is more effective in reducing emissions than PFI of n-butanol combined with DI of biodiesel and also less likely to produce knock.

The article seeks to challenge the weak position of public policy aimed at tackling this major issue and the shortcomings of reliance on food corporations' voluntary and sporadic approach based on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach: A review of literature and analysis of the legal and economic theories of the firm show how both public and private intervention tends to be ineffective in facing the many problems raised by climate change within the food sector. This article proposes a ""government case"" for CSR. Findings: It is argued that interventions to tackle climate change are political rather than economic and depend on power relationships among different actors, such as states and large corporations, involved in their implementation. The main conclusion of the article is that a renovated agenda to tackle climate change ought to be based on the two pillars of soft regulation-voluntary CSR and binding state regulation. In this new scenario corporate and antitrust laws should be used to correct the growing imbalance between corporate rights and corporate responsibility, with binding regulations supporting voluntary CSR. Originality/value: Application of CSR has been left to corporations which have pursued their own piecemeal agenda; and the predominant creed of neoliberalism has been ineffectual in governance.

This includes a resurgence of interest in the Gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis enzymes as drug targets. The six carbon acidic sugar 2-keto-3-deoxymanno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) is a component of the lipid A moiety of the LPS in Gram-negative bacteria. In most cases the lipid A substituted by Kdo is the minimum requirement for cell growth, thus presenting the possibility of targeting either the synthesis or incorporation of Kdo for the development of antibacterial agents. Indeed, potent in vitro inhibitors of Kdo biosynthesis enzymes have been reported but have so far failed to show sufficient in vivo action against Gram-negative bacteria. As part of an effort to design more potent antibacterial agents targeting Kdo biosynthesis, the crystal structures of the key Kdo biosynthesis enzymes from Escherichia coli have been solved and their structure based mechanisms characterized. In eukaryotes, Kdo is found as a component of the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan II in the plant primary cell wall. Interestingly, despite incorporating Kdo into very different macromolecules the Kdo biosynthesis and activation pathway is almost completely conserved between plants and bacteria.

The ecocity model recognizes that cities are part of natural systems and favors walkable neighborhoods. This article introduces ecocity mapping, an innovative planning method, to the public health literature on community engagement by describing a pilot project with a new affordable housing development in Oakland, California between 2007 and 2009. Although ecocity mapping began as a paper technology, advances in geographic information systems (GIS) moved it forward. Objectives: This article describes how Ecocity Builders used GIS to conduct ecocity mapping to (1) assess vitality of neighborhoods and urban centers to prioritize community health intervention pilot sites and (2) create scenario maps for use in community health planning. Methods: From fall 2007 to summer 2008, Ecocity Builders assessed neighborhood vitality using walking distance from parks, schools, rapid transit stops, grocery stores, and retail outlets. In 2008, ecocity maps were shared with residents to create a neighborhood health and sustainability plan. In 2009, Ecocity Builders developed scenario maps to show how changes to the built environment would improve air quality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, while increasing access to basic services and natural amenities. Conclusions: Community organizing with GIS was more useful than GIS alone for final site selection. GIS was useful in mapping scenarios after residents shared local neighborhood knowledge and ideas for change. Residents were interested in long-term environmental planning, provided they could meet immediate needs. © 2013 The Johns Hopkins University Press.","Community assessment; Community health partnerships; Ecocity mapping; Environmental design; Geographic information systems; Pacific states; Quality of life; Social change; Sustainable development; Urban population","article; demography; environmental planning; geographic information system; health promotion; health services research; human; methodology; pilot study; policy; public relations; quality of life; United States; walking; California; Community-Institutional Relations; Environment Design; Geographic Information Systems; Health Promotion; Humans; Organizational Case Studies; Pilot Projects; Quality of Life; Residence Characteristics; Urban Renewal; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882612997

It focuses on the role of central government, local agencies and householders in making adaptations to the built and natural environment. Design/methodology: This paper uses evidence from three facilitated workshops run with built environment and policy professionals associated with climate change adaptation in three cities in England: Oxford, Bristol and Stockport. The workshop contributions are presented in relation to the potential role that central government, local agencies and residents could play in adapting suburbs. Findings: Central government, local agencies and householders form an interconnected network of agents responsible for adaptive action in suburbs. Professional and institutional stakeholders expect central government to take a lead and ensure planning policies and building regulations support effective adaptation. However, those local authorities and agencies that are expected to offer leadership locally do not have the resources to make adaptation happen on the ground. Overall, the stakeholders in this research believe that effective adaptation in suburbs may only happen once householders and government have experienced worsening climatic conditions. This could be a very costly stance in the long term. Originality/value: This paper provides empirical evidence on how stakeholders engaged in suburban adaptation are making changes now, and on how they envisage change in the future. It reveals clearly the challenges involved in integrating mitigation and adaptation actions and highlight the complexities around implementation on the ground. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Adaptation; Built environment; Climate change; Housing","Adaptation; Building regulations; Built environment; Central government; Climate change adaptation; Climatic conditions; Interconnected network; Natural environments; Building codes; Housing; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883115932

However, biofuel production also raises a number of environmental concerns. One of these is the risk of biological invasion, which is a key issue with second generation biofuel crops derived from fast-growing perennial grasses and woody plant species. Many of the most popular second generation crops proposed for cultivation in the U.S. and Canada are not native to North America, and some are known to be invasive. The development of a large-scale biofuel industry on the continent could lead to the widespread introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive plant species if invasive risks are not properly considered as part of biofuel policy. In this paper, we evaluate the risk of biological invasion posed by the emerging second generation biofuel industry in the U.S. and Canada by examining the invasive risk of candidate biofuel plant species, and reviewing existing biofuel policies to determine how well they address the issue of invasive species. We find that numerous potentially invasive plant species are being considered for biofuel production in the U.S. and Canada, yet invasive risk receives little to no attention in these countries' biofuel policies. We identify several barriers to integrating invasive species and biofuel policy, relating to policy analytical capacity, governance, and conflicting policy objectives. We recommend that governments act now, while the second generation biofuel industry is in its infancy, to develop robust and proactive policy addressing invasive risk. Policy options to minimize biological invasions include banning the use of known invasive plant species, ongoing monitoring of approved species, and use of buffer zones around cultivated areas. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuels; Biological invasion; Invasive species; Policy; Risk; Second generation","Crops; Cultivation; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Risks; Biofuel production; Biological invasion; Economic diversification; Environmental concerns; Invasive species; On-going monitoring; Second generation; Woody plant species; Biofuels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880386695

CHP systems have the potential to reduce operating costs, emissions, and primary energy consumption when compared with electricity purchased from the grid and thermal energy produced from a boiler, and these benefits have been shown to depend on the location where the system is to be installed as well as the characteristics of the system itself. A CHP system is analyzed in 9 U.S. cities in different climate zones which differ in both the local electricity generation fuel mix and local electricity prices. Its potential to produce economic, emissions, and energy savings is quantified based on the concepts of required spark spread, emissions spark spread, and primary energy spark spread. The corresponding parameters for cost ratio, carbon dioxide emissions ratio, and primary energy ratio are plotted on a 3-dimensional graph which illustrates these potential benefits simultaneously. The location of each point on the 3-D graph indicates for a given geographical location whether the system falls within a region of multiple potential benefits from CHP technology. The results are unique to the efficiencies of the CHP system components and the alternate heating system. A simple sensitivity analysis is then conducted to examine the influence of electrical generation efficiency, the percentage of heat recovered, and the heating system on the cost, emissions, and energy savings potential of CHP systems. Of the 9 cities analyzed, Duluth, MN, is shown to have the greatest potential to provide these three types of benefits by using a CHP system. The results are most sensitive to the values of two input parameters: CHP electrical efficiency and CHP thermal efficiency. Changes in the input efficiency values are most influential when the electrical efficiency is low, and as the amount of recovered heat goes to 0, the electrical efficiency becomes the most important factor in whether a CHP shows the potential for cost, emissions, and energy benefits.

There is an increasing interest in accurate information on local vehicle emission levels for policy development and sustainable traffic management. Previous studies have shown that emission predictions for the Australian situation need to reflect both the Australian fleet and driving behaviour to avoid unreliable outcomes. This paper discusses a new Australian vehicle emission software (PΔP) and a case-study where traffic simulation software (Aimsun) is combined with PΔP to demonstrate how consistent results can be achieved for the Australian situation. The case-study is an Australian city modelled using the microscopic simulator to generate the required trajectory data of each individual vehicle for the emission model. The simulation results are used in a number of ways: To assess the impacts of urban driving behaviour on fuel consumption, to create maps showing where and when elevated emission levels occur and to compare results with another program (COPERT Australia).

The thermal emission source in optically thick cells is partitioned into separate contributions from the cell interiors (where the likelihood of the particles escaping the cells is virtually zero) and the ""fringe"" regions close to the cell boundaries. Thermal emission in the cell interiors can now be modelled with fewer particles, the remaining particles being concentrated in the fringes so that they are more likely to contribute to the energy exchange between cells. Unlike other techniques for improving the efficiency in optically thick regions (such as random walk and discrete diffusion treatments), fringe biasing has the benefit of simplicity, as the associated changes are restricted to the sourcing routines with the particle tracking routines being unaffected. This paper presents an analysis of the potential for variance reduction achieved from employing the fringe biasing technique. The aim of this analysis is to guide the implementation of this technique in Monte Carlo thermal radiation codes, specifically in order to aid the choice of the fringe width and the proportion of particles allocated to the fringe (which are interrelated) in multi-dimensional simulations, and to confirm that the significant levels of variance reduction achieved in simulations can be understood by studying the behaviour for simple test cases. The variance reduction properties are studied for a single cell in a slab geometry purely absorbing medium, investigating the accuracy of the scalar flux and current tallies on one of the interfaces with the surrounding medium.","IMC; Monte Carlo; SIMC; Thermal radiation transport; Variance reduction","IMC; Multidimensional simulation; Radiation transport; Radiation transport codes; SIMC; Thermal emission sources; Variance reduction techniques; Variance reductions; Cells; Computational methods; Cytology; Heat radiation; Nuclear physics; Radiative transfer; Monte Carlo methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883357933

Methods for preventing dangerous levels of pollutants in ecologically important zones are suggested. The methods are based on the control of emission rates of sources and use the direct and adjoint estimates of the average pollution concentration in the zones. While the direct estimates use solutions of the pollution transport problem and permit to study the ecological situation in the whole domain, the adjoint estimates allow getting information only in the selected zones of the domain. The adjoint estimates are obtained with solutions to the adjoint problem and depend explicitly on the positions of the sources and their emission rates, and on the initial distribution of pollutants in the region. In each such estimate, the adjoint problem solution serves as the influence function that shows the quantitative contribution of every source into the pollution of the corresponding zone. This makes the adjoint estimates very efficient tools in the study of the model response to changes in emission rates and initial conditions, as well as in the development of control strategies. Both non-optimal (sufficient) and optimal control strategies are suggested. Each strategy consists in reducing the emission rates of sources, and defines maximum allowable intensity (in case of optimal control), or sufficient intensity (in case of sufficient control) of each source to avoid violations of hygiene standards. Such criteria are designed taking into account dynamic conditions in the atmosphere or ocean (sea), that is, the processes of propagation, dispersion and transformation of pollutants, as well as the number of sources to control, their locations and the sanitary norms. The control methods developed are illustrated with simple examples using two-dimensional dispersion models. However, these methods can also be applied to three-dimensional models. As an example, in the last part of the article, a three-dimensional model of dispersion is considered. In addition, to expand the scope of application of the methods of control of the intensity of sources, the optimal control strategies are applied to a source that emits a chemical substance to clean aquatic systems contaminated with biofilms (remediation) or oil (bioremediation).","Adjoint model; Control of emission rates of sources; Dispersion model","adjoint method; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); dispersion; emission control; emission inventory; pollutant transport; three-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879949354

As states often face pressure from polluting industries to reduce federally-enforceable Clean Air Act commitments, and as the United States EPA does not have the capacity to closely control state compliance with federal law, there arise instances where states shirk their obligations under the Clean Air Act. For decades, private and non-profit organizations have been able to use the citizen suit provision of the Clean Air Act to enjoin such state implementation failures. This Note challenges the Sixth Circuit's decision to curtail the scope of such suits in Sierra Club v. Korleski. This Note explores the history of the citizen suit provision and finds that it has been consistently used to prevent states from subverting national environmental goals under the Clean Air Act. Contrary to the Sixth Circuit's contention, this Note argues that Endangered Species Act caselaw is inapposite for an analysis of the scope of the Clean Air Act citizen suit provision. This Note concludes by arguing that authorizing private party suits to enjoin states from flouting voluntary Clean Air Act obligations does not offend the Tenth or Eleventh Amendments of the United States Constitution and instead promotes the legitimacy of the cooperative federalism scheme.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884577058

Recent studies have analysed the changes in rainfall patterns at global as well as regional scales around the world. These studies have also suggested that any analysis of hydro-climatic variables should be performed at the local scale rather than at a large or global scale because the trends and their effects may be different from one location to the other. The Tamarabarani River basin is one of the important basins in Southern Tamil Nadu with rich surface water resources. The basin is mainly agriculture based and people are engaged in the cultivation of various crops like paddy, cotton, sugarcane, groundnut, etc. The Tamarabarani River provides consistent irrigation to a large agricultural area within the basin. The Tamarabarani River and its tributaries have many dams, with reservoirs providing water for irrigation and power generation. The Papanasam and Manimuthar dams located on the western part of the basin are two of the major reservoirs that cater to the water requirements of the district. The basin receives a majority of its rainfall during the northeast monsoon, which is during the months of October, November and December (with November having the maximum rainfalls). Thus, step changes and trends in rainfall for these stations and during the monsoon months would especially be of interest to the farmers, irrigators and water resource managers in the basin. Since no studies on hydro-climatic trend analysis were found specific to this basin, this study performs a spatiotemporal trend analysis on long-term rainfall records (1971-2000) at 14 measuring stations within the basin. The Mann-Kendall test was used to detect trends and the cumulative summation (CUSUM) technique was used to identify the trend beginning year for monthly rainfall data. The results of the CUSUM test indicated that the two stations of Papanasam and Dam Camp located in the Western Ghats had a statistically significant step-up change during the late nineteen seventies and early eighties. The trend analysis results indicated that increasing trends were observed (for most of the months) at 3 stations, which are Dam Camp, Papanasam and Cheranmadevi. The Cheranmadevi station exhibited the maximum number of months (seven out of twelve) with statistically significant increasing trends. For Papanasam and Cheranmadevi, the month of November exhibited statistically significant increasing trends. This is encouraging from the irrigation point of view, since these stations are located on the forested western part of the basin, which forms the catchment area for the major reservoirs. Thus, there is an increase in potential for harvesting water from this part of the basin. On the other hand, it is observed that five stations have exhibited predominantly decreasing trends for most of the months during the past three decades. These stations are Tirunelveli, Manimuthar, Nanguneri, Kovilpatti and Ayyikudi. Most of these stations are located in the central part of the river basin and these areas would need special attention as over exploitation of surface as well as ground water resources in these regions need to be restricted to conserve water for future use. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Mann-Kendall test; Rainfall; Trend analysis","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Catchments; Cultivation; Dams; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Operations research; Rain; Rivers; Stream flow; Surface water resources; Watersheds; Agricultural areas; Climatic variables; Mann-Kendall test; Measuring stations; Monthly rainfalls; Spatiotemporal trends; Trend analysis; Water requirements; Reservoirs (water)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080864243

The region experiences high rainfall variability and a skilful forecast can help populations prepare for above-normal or below-normal rainy seasons. This study is a part of a larger project that aims to develop a streamflow forecasting framework for the Sirba watershed located in Niger and Burkina Faso, West Africa. The first step of the larger project consists of predicting seasonal precipitation on the watershed several months ahead using Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The second step (not yet completed) will consist of transforming the forecasted precipitation into streamflow. The July-September precipitation was linked to gridded SST data sets from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Several techniques were used to reduce the dimensionality of the predictors: a) discarding grid points for which the correlation with the predictand is below a certain threshold; b) building a linear model with a grid point SST and discarding it by considering the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient; c) using principal component analysis or canonical correlation analysis to obtain a small number of meaningful predictors. The prediction skills of the retained predictors are checked using a leave one out cross validation procedure. Results shows that the March-May Pacific Ocean SST are the best predictor for the comin rainy season (r2=0.378, EfO.312), followed by the October-December SST from the Atlantic Ocean (r2=0.254, Ef = 0.237).

We use the reduction in posterior variance of ROI EC, compared to the prior ROI EC variance, as the metric of primary interest, which we call the 'posterior variance reduction index' (PVRI). Systems that achieve a higher PVRI are considered superior to systems with lower PVRI. The approach is independent of the reconstruction method and is applicable to all photon-limited data types including list-mode data. We analyzed this approach using a model of 2-D tomography, and compared our results to the classical theory of tomographic sampling. We found that performance evaluations using the PVRI index were consistent with the classical theory.

However, the weak policies and economic drivers for CCS have slowed down the commercialization of CO 2 capture technologies needed for large scale removal. At the same time CO2 for the food and beverage industry is an existing and currently growing market for which the monoethanolamine (MEA)-based approach to provide CO2 is very energy intensive and in many cases not economical. Finding existing applications for next generation CO2 capture technologies at the small to medium-scale provides an important intermediate step for demonstrating and gaining the necessary knowledge required for further scaling up of novel CCS technologies. Low temperature CO 2 capture represents a novel alternative to state-of-the-art MEA post-combustion technology. The separation process aims at reducing the flue gas temperature from ambient to a low temperature range at which the CO2 freezes to be able to be removed from the main gas stream in a solid phase. This study presents the results of the assessment of integrating a novel low temperature CO2 capture technology into a Jenbacher reciprocating gas engine by investigating two different configurations of the low temperature CO2 capture process and comparing their performance with a stateof- The-art MEA absorption process. Results indicate that both configurations of the low temperature CO2 removal processes enable reduction of the specific energy requirement to capture CO2 by approximately 35% compared to the state-of-the-art MEA process.","Gas engine; Integration; Low temperature; MEA",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898733709

Since climate forecasts are updated on a monthly basis, we evaluate the potential in developing operational monthly streamflow forecasts on a continuous basis throughout the year. Further, basins in the rainfall-runoff regime critically depend on the forecasted precipitation in the upcoming months as opposed to snowmelt regimes where initial hydrological conditions (IHC) play a critical role. The goal of this study is to quantify the role of updated monthly precipitation forecasts and IHC in forecasting 6-month lead monthly streamflow and soil moisture for a rainfall-runoff mechanism dominated basin-Apalachicola River at Chattahoochee, FL. The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface model is implemented with two forcings: (a) updated monthly precipitation forecasts from ECHAM4.5 Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) forced with sea surface temperature forecasts and (b) daily climatological ensembles. The difference in skill between the above two quantifies the improvements that could be attainable using the AGCM forecasts. Monthly retrospective streamflow forecasts are developed from 1981 to 2010 and streamflow forecasts estimated from the VIC model are also compared with those predicted by using the principal component regression (PCR) model. The mean square error (MSE) in predicting monthly streamflows, using the VIC model, are compared with the MSE of streamflow climatology under ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscilation) conditions as well as under normal years. Results indicate that VIC forecasts obtained using ECHAM4.5 are significantly better than VIC forecasts obtained using climatological ensembles and PCR models over 2-6 month lead time during winter and spring seasons in capturing streamflow variability and reduced mean square errors. However, at 1-month lead time, streamflow utilizing the climatological forcing scheme outperformed ECHAM4.5 based streamflow forecasts during winter and spring, indicating a dominant role of IHCs up to a 1-month lead time. During ENSO years, streamflow forecasts exhibit better skill even up to a six-month lead time. Comparisons of the seasonal soil moisture forecasts, developed using ECHAM4.5 forcings, with seasonal streamflows also show significant skill, up to a 6-month lead time, in the four seasons. © 2013 Author(s).",,"Atmospheric general circulation models; Hydrological condition; Land surface conditions; Precipitation forecast; Principal component regression; Sea surface temperature (SST); Streamflow variability; Variable infiltration capacities; Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Energy management; Mean square error; Principal component analysis; Runoff; Soil moisture; Weather forecasting; Stream flow; climatology; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; energy conservation; land surface; numerical model; polymerase chain reaction; rainfall-runoff modeling; seasonal variation; soil moisture; streamflow; surface temperature; weather forecasting; Apalachicola River; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879065291

This paper analyses potential for energy conservation in EAF for three different grades of stainless steel belonging to AISI 200,300,400 series. In this concept, melting is performed in two different furnaces,one EBT type and the other Spout type.In EBT furnace only high ferrous melt with liquid pig iron and DRI/Scrap are charged and dephosphorized. In the spout furnace high carbon ferrochrome which has a tendancy to solidify rapidly due to its high melting point of nearly 1575°C is diluted with scrap which brings down its melting point drastically to enable it to be kept molten.Silicon in the high carbon ferrochrome is gainfully utilised to raise the temperature of molten pool.The diluted ferrochrome is taken in ladle in appropriate portion to which dephosphorised decarburized molten steel is added from EBT furnace for charging into AOD. The material and energy balance have been carried out for the entire charge mix using classical approach of energy calculation. Both variants of DRI and scrap addition to hot metal have been considered for the EBT furnace. Calculations for EBT furnace have been validated using data from an existing carbon steel plant using similar practice of steel making.

After implementing Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) technology to comply with 2007 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emissions regulations, OEMs have turned their attention towards NOx reductions with SCR technology. Current SCR technologies include liquid based Urea injection into the exhaust stream for NOx reductions and Solid Ammonia Storage and Delivery System (ASDS) which involves dosing gaseous Ammonia. Irrespective of the technology in use, the estimation of engine-out NOx emissions plays a vital role in reductant (Urea/Ammonia) dosing estimation via feed-back controls. The general method for determination of the engine-out NOx emissions is to use commonly available NOx emission sensors (NOx Sensors). However, NOx sensors have their own drawbacks. With On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) requirements in place for the 2013 model year, the use of additional sensors translates to additional implementation costs adding up to warranty and maintenance costs. Therefore, the necessity of the virtual engine out NOx emission estimation is very important. In this regard, a study has been performed to predict the engine out NOx emission values both at steady state and transient conditions. The NOx emission model uses the empirical relation that is based upon the real time estimation of NOx emissions. The empirical relation is a function of engine parameters such as engine speed, engine load, intake Oxygen concentration, injection quantity, timing, fuel pressure etc. Copyright © 2013 SAE International.",,"Ammonia; Diesel engines; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Environmental technology; Fuel economy; Metabolism; Urea; Aftertreatment systems; Combustion characteristics; Diesel particulate filters; Emissions regulations; Heavy-duty diesel engine; Oxygen concentrations; Steady state and transients; Storage and delivery systems; Nitrogen oxides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881208147

When a Smelter TOC operating strategy is cascaded down to the Carbon Plant, and then to the Paste Plant, it provides context for how to best approach Paste Plant operating and maintenance activities. In addition to defining the most appropriate strategy, TOC principles and tools can be applied to activities such as routine maintenance and larger non-routine maintenance projects. For example, Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) is a TOC technique that increases the speed and quality of these activities and can increase asset reliability and available run time, giving lower cost production runs and greater predictability.

Following that trend, the metering activities have accompanied that progress, and reached their boom with the embracement of smart metering. In the recent past, the electricity grid was characterized by its verticality and unidirectional flow from generation to consumption. The interactivity with clients was nonexistent and there was no major need for providing information, apart from the strictly needed billing data. This paradigm suffered a remarkable adjustment, with the introduction of renewable energy connected not only to the transmission grids but also in to distribution grids. Indeed, renewable generation offered not only variable production to the grids, but also bidirectional energy flows. Furthermore, the emergence of smaller generators extended the challenge to the low voltage level (230 V) and the promotion of electricity efficiency, locally and internationally, through the European directives, namely the 20/20/20 target, has given a more active role to consumers in the electricity sector. The referred factors, together with the expansion in the grid, largely supported by the growth of renewable energy, resulted in more information to deal with and, subsequently, more systems to manage such data. Therefore, under this paradigm, the Inovgrid project was highlighted - EDP Distribuição designed an approach for its implementation, bearing in mind that clear value creation for customer must be both achieved and perceived. Moreover, as customer's reaction is of primary concern, frequent surveys are conducted near the target population, providing a deep understanding of the evolving perception. This method results in a more efficient and open relationship with the consumers. Furthermore, the Inovgrid project brought several benefits for the energy sector's value chain as a whole. Amongst them, the following can be emphasized: rigorous measurement of the monthly consumptions from low voltage costumers, putting an end the consumption's estimates; increasing the effectiveness of responses to various requests; contracted power optimization; allowing historical consumption analysis and online tracking of corrective measures to commercial and industrial customers; improving control over commercial losses. These are all relevant gains to social equity and to the economic and financial sustainability of the electricity system. All in all, we have travelled from a concept in which the customer was a user of services defined unilaterally and unidirectionally, to a client centric one, focusing not only economical on aspects but also on social and behavioural features. This vanguardist model allows a new approach on many aspects, namely, energy efficiency, CO2 reduction and smart consumption patterns which represent, above all, an active customer's need for information.",,"Consumption patterns; Corrective measures; Electricity efficiencies; Financial sustainability; Industrial customer; Renewable generation; Unidirectional flow; Variable production; Electric generators; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Exhibitions; Sales",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897630294

In these regions the adaptation challenge is complicated by the fact that elevation contrasts and dissected topography produce diverse climatic conditions that are often accompanied by significant ecological and agricultural diversity within a relatively small region. Such is the case for the Choke Mountain watersheds, in the Blue Nile Highlands of Ethiopia. These watersheds extend from tropical alpine environments at over 4000 m elevation to the hot and dry Blue Nile gorge that includes areas below 1000 m elevation, and contain a diversity of slope forms and soil types. This physical diversity and accompanying socio-economic contrasts demand diverse strategies for enhanced climate resilience and adaptation to climate change. To support development of locally appropriate climate resilience strategies across the Blue Nile Highlands, we present here an agroecosystem analysis of Choke Mountain, under the premise that the agroecosystem-the intersection of climatic and physiographic conditions with agricultural practices-is the most appropriate unit for defining adaptation strategies in these primarily subsistence agriculture communities. To this end, we present two approaches to agroecosystem analysis that can be applied to climate resilience studies in the Choke Mountain watersheds and, as appropriate, to other agroecologically diverse regions attempting to design climate adaptation strategies. First, a full agroecoystem analysis was implemented in collaboration with local communities. It identified six distinct agroecosystems that differ systematically in constraints and adaptation potential. This analysis was then paired with an objective landscape classification trained to identify agroecosystems based on climate and physiographic setting alone. It was found that the distribution of Choke Mountain watershed agroecosystems can, to first order, be explained as a function of prevailing climate. This suggests that the conditions that define current agroecosystems are likely to migrate under a changing climate, requiring adaptive management strategies. These agroecosystems show a remarkable degree of differentiation in terms of production orientation and socio-economic characteristics of the farming communities suggesting different options and interventions towards building resilience to climate change. ©2013 by the authors.","Adaptation; Agroecosystem; Climate change; Ethiopia","adaptation; adaptive management; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural practice; climate change; environmental economics; subsistence agriculture; upland region; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882668440

In the western part of the loess belt centered around 50 N, these variations appear to have been related to the North Atlantic rapid climate changes: the Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) and Heinrich (H) events. It has been recently suggested that the North Atlantic climate signal can be detected further east, in loess deposits from Stayky (50 05.65' N, 30 53.92' E), Ukraine. Here we use climate and dust emission modeling to investigate this data interpretation. We focus on the areas north and northeast of the Carpathians, where loess deposits can be found, and the corresponding main dust sources must have been located as well. The simulations were performed with the LMDZ atmospheric general circulation model and the ORCHIDEE land surface model. They represent a reference ""Greenland stadial"" state and two perturbations, seen as sensitivity tests with respect to changes in the North Atlantic surface conditions between 30 and 63 N: a ""Greenland interstadial"" and an ""H event"". The main source for the loess deposits in the studied area is identified as a dust deflation band, with two very active spots located west-northwest from our reference site. Emissions only occur between February and June. Differences from one deflation spot to another, and from one climate state to another, are explained by analyzing the relevant meteorological and surface variables. Over most of the source region, the annual emission fluxes in the ""interstadial"" experiment are 30 to 50% lower than the ""stadial"" values; they would only be about 20% lower if the inhibition of dust uplift by the vegetation were not taken into account. Assuming that lower emissions result in reduced dust deposition leads us to the conclusion that the loess-paleosol stratigraphic succession in the Stayky area reflects indeed North Atlantic millennial variations. In the main deflation areas of Western Europe, the vegetation effect alone determined most of the (∼50% on average) stadial-interstadial flux differences. Even if its impact in Eastern Europe is less pronounced, this effect remains a key factor in modulating aeolian emissions at the millennial timescale. Conditions favorable to initiating particularly strong dust storms within a few hundred kilometers upwind from our reference site, simulated in the month of April of the H event experiment, support the correlation of H events with peaks in grain size index in some very detailed loess profiles, indicating increased coarse sedimentation. © 2013.

Nutrient depleted fjord water with natural plankton assemblages, enclosed in nine mesocosms of ∼ 50 m3 in volume, was exposed to p/CO2 levels ranging initially from 185 to 1420 μatm. NCP estimations are the cumulative change in dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations after accounting for gas exchange and total alkalinity variations. Stoichiometric coupling between inorganic carbon and nutrient net uptake is shown as a ratio of NCP to a cumulative change in inorganic nutrients. Phytoplankton growth was stimulated by nutrient addition half way through the experiment and three distinct peaks in chlorophyll concentration were observed during the experiment. Accordingly, the experiment was divided in three phases. Cumulative NCP was similar in all mesocosms over the duration of the experiment. However, in phases I and II, NCP was higher and in phase III lower at elevated CO2. Due to relatively low inorganic nutrient concentration in phase I, C : N and C : P uptake ratios were calculated only for the period after nutrient addition (phase II and phase III). For the total post-nutrient period (phase II + phase III) ratios were close to Redfield, however they were lower in phase II and higher in phase III. Variability of NCP, C : N and C : P uptake ratios in different phases reflects the effect of increasing CO2 on phytoplankton community composition and succession. The phytoplankton community was composed predominantly of haptophytes in phase I, prasinophytes, dinoflagellates, and cryptophytes in phase II, and haptophytes, prasinophytes, dinoflagellates and chlorophytes in phase III (Schulz et al., 2013). Increasing ambient inorganic carbon concentrations have also been shown to promote primary production and carbon assimilation. For this study, it is clear that the pelagic ecosystem response to increasing CO 2 is more complex than that represented in previous work, e.g. Bellerby et al. (2008). Carbon and nutrient uptake representation in models should, where possible, be more focused on individual plankton functional types as applying a single stoichiometry to a biogeochemical model with regard to the effect of increasing CO2 may not always be optimal. The phase variability in NCP and stoichiometry may be better understood if CO2 sensitivities of the plankton's functional type biogeochemical uptake kinetics and trophic interactions are better constrained. © 2012 Author(s).",,"acidification; alkalinity; biogeochemical cycle; carbon; community structure; growth rate; mesocosm; nitrogen; pelagic environment; phosphorus; pollution effect; stochasticity; trophic interaction; volume; Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880526130

In order to estimate future streamflow, a major exercise was undertaken to simulate the flows under a range of future climate projections. A suite of five rainfall-runoff models was calibrated against observed flow in 106 gauged catchments across the region. The results from weighted means of 31 ensembles, made up of all of the linear additive combinations of the five models, were examined for their ability to reproduce the measured streamflows.

These pores have a large surface area that strongly adsorbs hydrocarbons. The adsorbed hydrocarbons provide a significant amount of hydrocarbon storage, but also reduce the amount of pore space available for storage of the non-adsorbed hydrocarbons. For methane at reservoir pore pressures, depending on the pore size distribution, the pore space available to store free gas can be more than 30% smaller than the pore space that would be estimated by the standard low pressure helium porosity measurement on ground up samples. The existence of the adsorbed hydrocarbon layer affects transport in two ways. It reduces the space in the organic pores available for free hydrocarbon flow i.e. modifies their permeability, and provides a secondary mode for hydrocarbon transport, diffusion in the adsorbed layer. The permeability alteration is pore pressure dependent and depends on the organic pore size distribution. For methane, calculations show the effect can also be on the order of 30%. Methane storage is investigated by presenting a model that quantifies storage in terms of five parameters, the two Langmuir adsorption parameters, the maximum density of the adsorbed state, the pore volume at zero pore pressure, and pore volume compressibility. The experimental measurement of these parameters is discussed and data from a Barnett core sample is given. For methane transport a transport equation has been developed that is the sum of two coupled terms. The first term is the free gas term that depends on the geometrical permeability and a correction term that accounts for viscosity modification in nano-pores, and wall effects. The second term is a diffusion term that depends on a diffusion coefficient. In the first term adsorption alters both the geometric permeability and the correction term. Both transport mechanisms are driven by the pore pressure gradient. As pore pressure increases the geometrical permeability is reduced but the correction term acts in a more complex way. It depends on the ratio of the methane mean free path to an effective pore size parameter so as pore pressure increases mean free path decreases but the effective pore size also decreases. Model studies are presented that calculate the effective permeability as a function of pore pressure and pore side distributions. For transport in the adsorbed layer to be significant relative to free gas transport the diffusion coefficient needs to relatively large.

Thesematerials display unexpected failure because the satellite periodically goes into and out of the earth shadow region on orbit, leading to a change in its surface temperature. As the coefficient of thermal expansion of carbon fibers is an order of magnitude lower than that of the polymer matrix, repeated thermal stresses are generated in the composites under the alternative temperature field, resulting in damage to the materials and a decrease in mechanical properties. The main objective of this study is to develop an analytical model to predict the damage produce in the composites subjected to extreme thermal loading. These thermal loading also causes the material to release strain energy. The results are presented in terms of strain produced during thermal cycling and also in the process of delamination. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Carbon Fiber Reinforced Composites; Delamination; Delamination strain; Energy released during delamination; Thermal cycling","Delamination; Fibers; Nanotechnology; Orbits; Polymer matrix composites; Reinforcement; Strain energy; Thermal cycling; Thermal expansion; Thermal load; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Earth shadow; On orbit; Space environment; Surface temperatures; Thermal loadings; Unexpected Failures; Fiber reinforced plastics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872467491

Therefore, it is important to look at near term radiative effects due to methane to develop mitigation strategies to counteract global warming trends via ground and airborne based measurements systems. These systems require the development of a time-resolved DIAL capability using a narrow-line laser source allowing observation of atmospheric methane on local, regional and global scales. In this work, a demonstrated and efficient nonlinear conversion scheme meeting the performance requirements of a deployable methane DIAL system is presented. By combining a single frequency 1064 nm pump source and a seeded KTP OPO more than 5 mJ of 1.6 μm pulse energy is generated with conversion efficiencies in excess of 20%. Even without active cavity control instrument limited linewidths (50 pm) were achieved with an estimated spectral purity of ~95%. Tunable operation over 400 pm (limited by the tuning range of the seed laser) was also demonstrated. This source demonstrated the critical needs for a methane DIAL system motivating additional development of the technology. © 2013 SPIE.","Frequency conversion; Lidar; Optical parametric oscillator; Solid state laser","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Environmental engineering; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Optical frequency conversion; Optical parametric oscillators; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Solid state lasers; Atmospheric methanes; Control instruments; Mitigation strategy; Nonlinear conversions; Performance requirements; Radiative effects; Single frequency; Tunable operations; Methane",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888188599

As the transport sector in most developing countries is unsustainable, 'low carbon development in transport' (LCDT) plans should address approaches to reduce emissions from transport, while maintaining or improving transport, as a catalyser of development. LCDT, as such, may pave a pathway towards LCD. Due to the complexity and uncertainty involved in long-term planning tasks, scenario-based planning support systems (PSS) have been regarded as useful tools for exploring future impacts of any kind of plans and policies. Thus, this paper aims at developing an urban accessibility based PSS for evaluating different scenarios of LCDT plans regarding their potential towards low carbon transport development in Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). This modelling framework combines an accessibility analysis and Activity-Structure-Intensity-Fuel (ASIF) framework in a GIS-based modelling platform. Based on interviews with government officials and documents of the Kathmandu Sustainable Urban Transport (KSUT) project, three plans were identified as qualifying for LCDT plans and were evaluated under high and low population growth scenarios. The evaluation shows that there could be an increase in accessibility along with emissions reduction gains for the current public transport (PT) improvement plan as well as for a plan of expanding the number of trolley buses in the PT vehicle fleet, under assumptions of a low population growth scenario. The trolley bus renewal plan can also lead to emissions reduction, but at the expense of accessibility. However, emissions would still be high against the base year for all the plans in the high population growth scenario. Performing a sensitivity analysis, it was concluded that penetration of trolley bus in the vehicle fleet has a great potential towards LCD. The results show that a shift from private to public transport is necessary in all the LCDT plans to realize a LCD in transport. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.","Kathmandu Metropolitan City; Low carbon development; Low carbon development in transport; Planning support system; Urban accessibility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994130920

Current IPCC Guidelines for calculating nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from sewage management are both highly uncertain and incomplete; a major methodological gap relates to the calculation of indirect N2O emissions from sewage disposed to marine environments. Here we apply a novel approach to estimate past and future global sewage-nitrogen emissions to coastal oceans and the potential marine N2O emissions linked to this nitrogen source. Then, by estimating the future cost associated with this largely uncharacterized emission source, we demonstrate the industry significance of developing a methodology for estimating N2O emissions from marine receiving environments. The capacity to accurately estimate, monitor and report GHG emissions has important consequences for informing future policy decisions regarding both mitigation and adaptation. A robust N2O emissions estimation methodology for sewage-nitrogen disposed to coastal oceans will allow the international water sector to more accurately and comprehensively inventory its N2O emissions. This will in turn allow for proper accounting of related future emissions liabilities while also enabling the sector to capitalize on any future economic returns linked to this source - providing much-needed capital to support the sector's future infrastructure and climate change adaptation challenges. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon emissions liability; Coastal zone; Emissions inventory; Greenhouse gas emissions crediting; Marine nitrous oxide emission factor; Sewage-nitrogen; Urban water sector","nitrogen; article; carbon footprint; climate change; cost; environmental planning; human; marine environment; nitrous oxide emission; priority journal; sea; sewage treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880371492

Extended methodology on rock measurements and estimation of conservative and optimistic storage capacity are presented. Uncertainties and risks of CO2 storage in the offshore structure E6 estimated as the most prospective for CO2 geological storage in the Baltic Region, and the largest among all onshore and offshore structures studied in Latvia, were discussed. We re-estimated the previous optimistic capacity of the E6 structure (265-630 Mt) to 251-602 Mt. Considering fault system within the E6 structure we estimated capacity of two compartments of the reservoir separately (E6-A and E6-B). Estimated by the optimistic approach CO2 storage capacity of the E6-A part was 243-582 Mt (mean 365 Mt) and E6-B part 8-20 Mt (mean 12 Mt). Conservative capacity was 97-233 Mt (mean 146 Mt) in the E6-A, and 4-10 Mt (mean 6 Mt) in the E6-B. The conservative average capacity of the E6-B part was in the same range as this capacity in the E7 structure (6 and 7 Mt respectively). The total capacity of the two structures E6 and E7, estimated using the optimistic approach was on average 411 Mt, and using the conservative approach, 159 Mt.","Carbon dioxide; Chemical composition; Latvia; Mineral composition; Offshore; Physical properties; Reservoir rocks; Sandstone; Sedimentary rocks; Underground storage","Cambrian; cap rock; carbon dioxide; chemical composition; mineralogy; Ordovician; quartz; reservoir rock; sandstone; sediment chemistry; sedimentary rock; Silurian; underground storage; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Region; Baltic Sea; Latvia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882782215

The resulting voltammograms show that the CO2 reduction occurs within the electrode potential region of 0.06-0.4 V vs. the dynamic hydrogen electrode (DHE) in a CO2 atmosphere. Products of the CO2 electrode reaction were then analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry, and a small amount of methanol was detected. Stripping voltammetry for CO and methanol was conducted, revealing that CO2 is reduced to methanol and almost all of it strongly adsorbs onto the Pt/C cathode. Finally, the CO2 electroreduction was shown to occur with a relatively high Coulombic efficiency of 30-50% at 0.06-0.25 V vs. DHE. Our study showed that the CO2 reduction was able to produce methanol in an MEA with Pt/C electrodes, which may have applications in future fuel cell development. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, a strong reducing atmosphere is formed in the region between burners and air ports in the case of two-stage combustion. This atmosphere promotes the formation of hydrogen sulfide (H 2S), which causes sulfidation corrosion at the boiler wall. The control of H2S formation and the prevention of corrosion are important in power plants. In this study, the characteristics of H2S formation in two-stage combustion were investigated using a test furnace for pulverized coal combustion. H2S was formed in the case of H 2 coexistence. The H2S concentration was affected by the fuel ratio and the sulfur content in coal. The H2S concentration is very low below a H2 concentration of about 2%, above which the H 2S concentration has a strong correlation with that of H2. Furthermore, it was found that after the release of sulfur has finished, H 2S and SO2 reach equilibrium concentrations in accordance with the equation SO2 + 3H2 = H2S + 2H2O. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Toyota Motor Corporation considers the PHEV, which can use electricity efficiently, to be the most practical solution to these issues. Toyota already began sales of the Prius Plug-in Hybrid in 2012 in the U.S., Europe and Japan, and also will introduce to the Chinese market. This is the first PHEV to be mass-produced by Toyota Motor Corporation. Prior to this, in December 2009, Toyota introduced 650 PHEVs through lease programs for verification testing in China, the U.S., Europe and Japan. The system of mass-production vehicle specifications has major improvements in response to the results of this verification testing. As a result, EV range was increased with a smaller battery, and the system weight has been drastically reduced. Additionally, the vehicle clears the most stringent emissions regulations in different regions, and was granted Enhanced AT-PZEV credit in California.

Methane was used as fuel, and four inert gases, Ar, N2, He and CO2 were used as diluents. Results show that, in the large diameter tube (Dg = 10.0 mm), the flame propagation range is the widest for Ar-dilution and becomes narrower in the order of N2, CO2 and He. In the small diameter tube (Dg = 3.6 mm), the propagation ranges of Ar and N 2 are narrowed in fuel-rich region, where the Lewis number is greater than unity. For CO2 and He-dilution, however, the propagation has not been observed. Because the quenching diameters for CO2- and He-dilution are significantly large, the flames are strongly affected by the tube wall. Further experiments have shown that, under high oxygen concentrations, the flame can propagate in the small diameter tube for all diluents, and the propagation range is the widest for Ar-dilution and becomes narrower in the order of N2, CO2 and He. The flame is slender for CO2, whereas the flame is wide for He, as compared with Ar and N2. These differences in flame appearance clearly indicate that the Lewis number of deficient reactant affects strongly on the flame propagation in small diameter tube, and for CO2-dilution, as the Lewis number is sufficiently less than unity, the flame diameter can be small, and thus, the wall effects can be reduced. Whereas for He-dilution, as the Lewis number is sufficiently greater than unity, the flame diameter becomes large, and thus, the wall effects can be enhanced. The flame speed of He-dilution becomes considerably lower than the other three mixtures. This retardation seems to be resulted from an increase in the burned gas density due to the cooling by the enhanced wall effect. © 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Compared with fossil fuel energy, renewable energy is not stable and cannot supply firm electrical output (i.e., it is nondispatchable). Fluctuating power from renewables may result in grid power oscillation. To reduce grid swing, energy storage is necessary to smooth output from renewable energy. Energy storage with high energy density and fast response time or high power capacity is desired for compensation of fluctuating output. Generally, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) has higher power capacity than battery energy storage, while battery provides higher energy density. Thus, this research proposes a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of an SMES and battery. Novel and practical synergistic control is presented for firming power fluctuation by exploiting the strong power and energy capabilities of the SMES and the battery while within the efficient operating range of (i.e., state of charges of) HESS. Comprehensive case studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed HESS topology and control algorithm using PSCAD/EMTDC. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","Battery; hybrid energy storage; state of charge (SOC) control; superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES)","Battery; Battery energy storage; Hybrid energy storage; Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS); Renewable energy source; State of charge; Superconducting magnetic energy storages; Use of renewable energies; Algorithms; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lead acid batteries; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Superconducting devices; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874914724

It has also led the way in terms of a holistic approach to sustainability which embraces curriculum, campus and community. External indicators of success have included achieving the ""Eco-Campus Gold Award"" (only five other UK universities have Gold or above) and rising up the UK-based People and Planet Green League Table from 20th to 5th place in 2011. Internally, the curriculum validation process has been successful in ensuring that all course teams address sustainability at course review; staff development has supported this endeavour. In the community, support has been given to local stakeholders (including Bournemouth Council) to implement the Earth Charter and to local businesses. Although achievements have been considerable, they have been largely driven, bottom-up, by a handful of committed champions. In 2011, a project was undertaken to secure a step change, gain greater leadership support for this agenda and to begin to develop an ethos that this is a collective responsibility. This paper will set out how the project has attempted to provide university board members and senior staff with the opportunity to consider how they serve as role models for leadership behaviour in sustainable development, and secure campus-wide buy in to carbon reduction. An action learning approach has provided board members and staff with the space to critically reflect on their roles and to develop coherent action plans for sustainable development. Analysis of the success of the approach and the leadership behaviours identified is provided. The conclusion suggests that while there has been some success, more work is required if higher education leaders are to fully incorporate sustainable development into their day-today actions. © Common Ground, Chris Shiel, All Rights Reserved.","Leadership behaviour; Sustainable development; University-wide approaches",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890103105

Those restricted the comprehensive understanding and accurate prediction of the effects of global change on plant growth characteristics. Stipa breviflora is one of the dominant plant species in desert steppe and a kind of forage grass with high quality. Investigating the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of S. breviflora to climate change is significant for maintaining the stabilization of desert ecosystem and the security of stockbreeding. We had studied the effects of increased CO2 concentration and varied precipitation as well as their interactions on the growth characteristics (such as plant height, leaf area, survival rate, leaf number and biomass, etc.) of S. breviflora based on the simulation experiment using open-top chambers (OTC) from June to August (the main growing season) in 2011. In this paper, three levels of CO2 concentrations (control, 450 and 550 μmol/mol), five levels of precipitation (-30%, -15%, control, +15%, and +30% based on the average monthly precipitation from 1978 to 2007 in Siziwangqi county, Inner Mongolia) and their interactions were studied. There were six replicates (i. e., six pots with four plants per pot) for every CO2 concentration treatment and precipitation treatment. The seeds were sowed on April 18th and well watered before control experiment. Then 90 pots of plants with consistent growing vigor were randomly selected and placed into different chambers as different treatments. High-purity CO2 was pumped into those chambers with high CO2 concentration day and night, regulated by a CO2 automatic control system. Each precipitation regime was converted to irrigation amounts of every month and then divided into 10 times to water, i. e. watered every three days after 4:00pm. The chambers were covered in rainy days to avoid extra water input. The whole experimental site was covered with sun-shading net to lower the temperature in chambers at 9:00-16:00 on clear days. Plant heights were measured in late July and late August, respectively. Leaf number, leaf area and biomass were measured at the stage with the biggest biomass. The results indicated that, comparing with the control, the growth characteristics of S. breviflora did not change significantly under 450μmol/mol CO2 concentration. However, the biomass, plant heights (in July), leaf area and single leaf area of S. breviflora increased significantly under 550μmol/mol CO2 concentration, while leaf number and plant heights (in August) did not change significantly. The changes of precipitation obviously affected the biomass, leaf area, leave number, plant height and survival rate of S. breviflora. The interactions of increased CO2 concentration and varied precipitation had significant effects on the biomass of S. breviflora. CO2 fertilization effect could offset the adverse impact induced by decreasing precipitation, but the effect of increasing CO2 concentration would be reduced markedly when the precipitation decreased about 30%. This result would help to understand the adaptation of desert steppe to future climatic change and to make countermeasures to cope with climatic change.","CO2 Concentration; Growth characteristics; Interaction; Precipitation; Stipa breviflora","biomass; carbon dioxide; climate change; concentration (composition); desert; forage; global change; grass; growing season; growth rate; leaf area; precipitation (climatology); steppe; survival; vigor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880940748

Moreover, in March 2009, the State Council of the People's Republic of China has issued a strategic policy on promoting Shanghai to be an international financial and shipping centre. Under such circumstance, this paper applied cost-benefit-analysis to analyse the feasibility of GHG emissions trading and raised proposals for corresponding actions for shipping companies' better adaption to the development of shipping industry and gain a favourable position in the carbon credits exchange market.","China; Emissions reduction; Emissions trading scheme; GHG; Greenhouse gas; Shipping",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881173560

The samples have a single phase nature with wurtzite structure and no other impurity phases were detected. The presence of OH groups on the as-grown samples surface was confirmed. After vacuum annealing and H2O2 solution treatment, the surface states and oxygen vacancies were modified in ZnO nanorods, resulting in suppressing the visible emission band and reducing the room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM). Experimental results suggest that OH groups could be responsible for the strong broad yellow emission band and RTFM for as-grown ZnO nanorods. Green emission bands in vacuum annealed and H 2O2-solution-treated samples could be attributed to singly ionized oxygen vacancy (V0+). A plausible explanation for the observed weak RTFM is presented in terms of V0+ for the annealed sample, whereas V0+ and residual OH groups for H2O2-solution-treated samples. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although lots of work are focused on improving their optical performance, little is known about the influence of the In distribution and the surface states on the microscopic light emission mechanism. In order to give an atomic level understanding, we investigate the electronic structures of the wurtziteGa-rich InGaN NWs with different In distributions using first-principles calculations. We find that the In-atoms are apt to distribute on the surface of the NWs and the short surface In-N chains can be easily formed. For the unsaturated NWs, several new bands are induced by the surface states, which can be modified by the surface In microstructures. The randomly formed surface In-N chains can highly localize the electrons/holes at the band edges and dominate the interband optical transition. For the saturated NWs, the band edges are determined by the inner atoms. Our work is useful to improve the performance of the InGaN NW-based optoelectronic devices. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Electronic structure; First-principles calculation; In-N chain; Luminescence mechanism","Atomic levels; Band edge; First-principles calculation; InGaN nanowires; Interband; Light emission mechanisms; Luminescence mechanisms; Optical performance; Atoms; Chains; Electronic structure; Indium; Light emission; Light emitting diodes; Materials science; Nanowires; Optoelectronic devices; Surface states; Zinc sulfide; Calculations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886789579

We focused on the electronic energy barriers for the first four lowest energy proton-electron transfer steps for reducing CO2 on Pt(111) beginning with adsorbed *CO2 and continuing with *COOH, *CO + H2O, *COH, and ending with *C + H2O. We find that simple elementary steps in which a proton is transferred to an adsorbate (such as the protonation of *CO to *COH) have small barriers on the order of 0.1 eV. Elementary steps in which a proton is transferred and a C-O bond is simultaneously cleaved show barriers on the order of 0.5 eV. All barriers calculated for these steps show no sign of being insurmountable at room temperature. To explain why these barriers are so small, we analyze the charge density and the density of states plots to see that first, the electron transfer is decoupled from the proton transfer so that in the initial state, the surface and adsorbate are already charged up and can easily accept the proton from solution. Also, we see that in the cases where barriers are on the order of 0.1 eV, electron density in the initial state localizes on the oxygen end of the adsorbate, while electron density is more spread out on the surface for initial states of the C-O bond cleaving elementary steps. © 2013 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876949829

In 2008 Minneapolis launched Homegrown Minneapolis, a multiple stakeholder initiative bringing together local government actors, businesses, and NGOs to build a sustainable and local food system. As the link between food systems and climate change is increasingly acknowledged in the literature, the analysis of food policy regimes provides valuable lessons for understanding the dynamics of urban climate governance. Theoretically, we attempt to contribute to the fields of urban climate governance and urban political theory by applying URT as developed by urban political theorist Clarence N Stone and others. To this end, a 'building blocks' approach is introduced, facilitating and enhancing the analysis of the different elements of a regime, including initiation, coalition building, agenda setting, resources, cooperation, and consensus building. We show that there are several key elements comprising successful regimes: individual political leadership, knowledge exchange, and community-wide collaborative engagement.","City of Minneapolis; Climate change; Food policy; Urban climate governance; Urban regime theory","climate change; decision making; environmental policy; food policy; governance approach; leadership; local government; nongovernmental organization; participatory approach; planning theory; stakeholder; sustainability; theoretical study; urban climate; Minneapolis; Minnesota; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886854516

Eucalyptus saligna Sm. seedlings were grown under three [CO2] levels (preindustrial (280LL-1), current (400LL-1) or projected (640LL-1)) and two air temperatures (current, (current+4°C)). Gravimetric water use, leaf gas exchange and tissue dry mass and %N were determined. Solid-state 15N-NMR spectroscopy was used for determining the partitioning of N chemical groups in the dry matter fractions. Water use efficiency (WUE) improved with increasing [CO2] at ambient temperature, but strong leaf area and weak reductions in transpiration rates led to greater water use at elevated [CO2]. High temperature increased plant water use, such that WUE was not significantly stimulated by increasing [CO2] at high temperature. Total N uptake increased with increasing [CO2] but not temperature, less than the increase recorded for plant biomass. Tissue [N] decreased with rising [CO2] and at high temperature, but N use efficiency increased with rising [CO2]. Total N uptake was positively correlated with total water use and root biomass under all treatments. Growth [CO2] and temperature did not affect the partitioning of 15N among the N chemical groups. The reductions of tissue [N] with [CO2] and temperature were generic, not specific to particular N compounds. The results suggest that reductions in tissue [N] are caused by changes in root N uptake by mass flow due to altered transpiration rates at elevated [CO2] and temperature. © 2013 CSIRO.","biomass; Eucalyptus saligna; transpiration; water use","carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; climate effect; gravimetry; high temperature; nitrogen; nutrient uptake; phytomass; seedling; shrub; transpiration; water uptake; water use efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873923158

The work function (Φ) values extracted from the thermionic emission data range from 4.1 to 4.7 eV. The range of Φ values is attributed to the morphological characteristics, such as tip radius, aspect ratio, density, and wall structure of CCNTs. The observed lower values for Φ are significantly smaller than that of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). The reduced Φ values are attributed to field penetration effect as a result of the local field enhancement from these structures having high aspect ratio and an excellent field enhancement factor. The high amplification of the external field at the apex of the nanostructures is capable of reducing both the barrier height and the width, in turn contributing to the improved emission current at lower temperatures. The ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy data of CCNTs grown on Pt wires are in reasonable agreement with the thermionic emission data.

Timing-sequential regionalized diesel combustion described in previous paper is realized by post injection and proper in-cylinder chemical atmosphere transport to keep post injection fuel injecting to high oxygen concentration region. Cases with EGR stratification have similar heat release rate character compare to uniform EGR case while lower soot emissions and identical NO emissions as local EGR rate equal to uniform case, similarly, lower NO emissions and identical soot emissions as EGR mass equal to uniform case. Axial and radical EGR stratification that defined artificially in cylinder under the condition of 1,650 r/min and 50% load have been numerically analysed by commercial STAR-CD code. It is indicated that both axial and radical distribution of EGR stratification make NO and soot emissions decrease simultaneously, however, radical EGR distribution works better. NO emissions decrease while soot emissions keep constant under the case of EGR stratification with post injection using main injection timing advance and higher local EGR rate; it is also found that cyclic net work per cylinder is improved at some extent. Intake port shape and swirl rate also have been investigated to analyse in-cylinder gradient of EGR distribution to achieve EGR stratification.

The reduction of carbon emission to alleviate the green house effect is now a world concerned problem which also perplexes further development of tunnel construction and is supposed to be solved. For this purpose, a quantitative evaluation method for comprehensive benefits and costs of the demonstration project of underground space are introduced in this paper. The method is applied to a highway tunnel in Anhui Province of China and the results show the proposed method providing a clear index of carbon consumption. In this engineering case, the various kinds of tunnel portal greening-design that are based on the concern of low-carbon effect will be introduced to demonstrate the achievement of ecology conservation. Tunnel portal greening-design is aimed at the ecologic concerns and scenic effects, generally, both of which cannot be described in a distinct route. The low carbon effect of virescence of tunnel portal will be estimated clearly in a quantifiable index in this paper. It will be beneficial to improve the scientific usage of the greening concepts on the tunnels in a much wider scope. Therefore relevant countermeasures and suggestions can be inspired in various tunnel portal greening-designs. Compared with general optimization of engineering economy, tunnel portal greening-design can accelerate the upgrading of low-carbon engineering effectively and achieve the sustainable development of the society.

The WTW analyses of BEVs, HEVs and ICEVs were conducted using the GREET (Greenhouse gases, regulated emissions, and energy use in Transportation) model developed by Argonne National Lab combined with a localized database of Chinese domestic data. A 2011 mid-size gasoline car is used as a baseline. Two types of BEV assumed in this study: Common BEVs and High-efficient BEVs. Common BEV pathways will save up to 99 % petrol consumption. However, comparing to that of HEV pathway, WTW energy consumption of all Common BEV pathways will be increased, with a maximum of 71 %. WTW energy consumption of High-efficient BEVs will be 2-29 % less than the WTW energy in the HEV pathway. GHG emissions of Common BEVs depend on differences in power generation technologies. Without CCS, the WTW GHG emissions of Common BEVs using coal-fired electricity are 11-77 % higher than the WTW GHG emissions of the baseline. When USC and IGCC generation technologies are equipped with CCS, the WTW GHG emissions of High-efficient BEVs are 79-83 % less than that of the baseline, and 69-75 % less than the hybrid pathway. This is the first time that a WTW analysis in China at this magnitude was completed with a fully localized fuel-cycle database. Outcomes of the study provide more relevance and accuracy for both the government and industry to develop strategies and policies in China. The model and database developed in this study can be used for analysis both at national and regional levels. This study did not include the energy use and GHG emissions in vehicle manufacturing stage. Although it is a small portion in the analysis, it could provide understanding of the difference in vehicle manufacturing process between EVs and traditional gasoline vehicles. This paper shows that the Common BEVs currently demonstrated are not a silver bullet for attacking energy consumption challenges and GHG emissions. In China context, full HEVs seem more attractive than Common BEVs to deal with energy security and GHG reduction challenge today. In order to achieve GHG reduction targets through vehicle electrification, China must promote CCS technology to help USC and IGCC power plants deliver low-carbon transportation energy on supply side. At the same time, High-efficient BEVs have to be set as the highest priority of automotive technology development. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","China; Electric vehicle; GHG emissions; Thermal power generation; Well-to-Wheel Analysis","Automotive technology; Battery electric vehicles; China; Coal-fired electricity; Energy security; Energy use; Gasoline vehicle; Generation technologies; GHG emission; In-vehicle; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Low-carbon; Petrol consumption; Power generation technology; Reduction targets; Regional levels; Regulated emissions; Thermal power generation; Total energy; Well-to-wheel analysis; Combined cycle power plants; Database systems; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Technology; Wheels; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869471271

EPRI convened a workshop of international stakeholders in 2011 entitled ""Health and Environmental Toxicity of Amines for Post-Combustion Carbon Capture: Launching a Dialogue on Research Needs"". A main goal was to bring together members of the solvent development community, government agencies, environmental organizations, academic researchers, industry, and other stakeholders to discuss different approaches to evaluating toxicity of solvents for CO2 capture, particularly in face of proprietary issues. Several research needs were identified, including improved risk assessment methodologies, additional pilot plant emissions data, improved understanding of atmospheric chemistry and losses. However despite these critical knowledge gaps the key outcome was that these gaps are ""fillable"" and are not ""deal-breakers"" for the technology. Another critical need identified by a majority of the 2011 Workshop attendees was to standardize stack sampling and analytical methods for amines and their degradation products. This led to the development in early 2012 of an international ""Amine and Amine Degradation Products Methods Standardization Working Group"". The group goals are to collaboratively evaluate efficacy of methods that already have or could be applied in power plant stacks, to discuss how to improve characterization of sampling artifacts, and to design a testing program to evaluate various sampling and analytical methods. The long-term goal of the working group is to produce guidelines for more accurate and consistent determination of emissions of amines, related compounds, and their degradation products. Methods reviewed included both online (e.g. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; proton-transfer-reaction and other types of mass spectrometry) and offline or manual (e.g. sorbent trapping and thermal desorbtion) analysis for both gas and particle phase compounds. The overall themes that emerged included the dependence of emissions and appropriate methods on the design and major components of the pilot facilities, the potential impacts of mist formation, and the need for additional laboratory and in-situ method comparison and evaluation testing programs. The results of EPRI's community-based efforts will be used to help direct future research on amine emissions, sampling and analysis methods, environmental fate and transport, and health impacts. © 2013 The Author.","Amines; Degradation products; Environmental impacts; Health impacts; Sampling and analysis methods",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898759199

The US Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) developed the Clinical Assessment for Systems Strengthening (ClASS) framework for technical assistance in resource-constrained settings. The ClASS framework involves all stakeholders in the identification of LPs' strengths and needs for technical assistance. This article examines the role of ClASS in building capacity of LPs that can endure and adapt to changing financial and policy environments. All stakeholders (n=68) in Kenya, Zambia, and Nigeria who had participated in the ClASS from LPs and IPs, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and, in Nigeria, HIV/AIDS treatment facilities (TFs) were interviewed individually or in groups (n=42) using an open-ended interview guide. Thematic analysis revealed stakeholder perspectives on ClASS-initiated changes and their sustainability. Local organizations were motivated to make changes in internal operations with the ClASS approach, PEPFAR's competitive funding climate, organizational goals, and desired patient health outcomes. Local organizations drew on internal resources and, if needed, technical assistance from IPs. Reportedly, ClASS-initiated changes and remedial action plans made LPs more competitive for PEPFAR funding. LPs also attributed their successful funding applications to their preexisting systems and reputation. Bureaucracy, complex and competing tasks, and staff attrition impeded progress toward the desired changes. Although CDC continues to provide technical assistance through IPs, declining PEPFAR funds threaten the consolidation of gains, smooth program transition, and continuity of treatment services. The well-timed adaptation and implementation of ClASS successfully engaged stakeholders who committed their own resources toward strengthening organizational capacity. The sustainability of built capacity depends on continued investment in leadership, staff retention, and quality improvement.",,"antiretrovirus agent; adult; article; capacity building; female; health care delivery; HIV/AIDS; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; international cooperation; Kenya; local partner; male; middle aged; Nigeria; organization; organization and management; participatory assessment; program evaluation; program transition; public-private partnership; technical assistance; United States; Zambia; capacity building; HIV/AIDS; local partner; participatory assessment; program transition; technical assistance; Adult; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Capacity Building; Delivery of Health Care; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; International Cooperation; Kenya; Male; Middle Aged; Nigeria; Organizational Objectives; Program Evaluation; Public-Private Sector Partnerships; United States; Zambia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905810614

One of the replacement materials is waste paper sludge ash (WPSA), a local industrial by-product generated abundantly by newsprint mills which possesses considerable cementitious properties. Parallel to this, the high amount of construction waste, particularly concrete waste has become a difficult environmental issue to cope with in today's world. For this reason, recycling of concrete waste as a new alternative aggregate is being effectively utilized in concrete production. Thus, this paper reports on a study conducted to evaluate the compressive strength characteristics of the potential of using WPSA as a binder and fine recycled concrete aggregate (FRCA) as a virgin sand replacement in producing foamed concrete. The findings of this study exhibited that the inclusion of WPSA and FRCA for replacement ratios up to 20% and 15% respectively has significantly influenced the strength properties of foamed concrete. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Fine recycled concrete aggregate; Foamed concrete; Waste material; Waste paper sludge ash","Alternative aggregates; Cementitious properties; Concrete productions; Construction wastes; Environmental issues; Foamed concrete; Industrial by-products; Newsprint mill; Paper sludge ash; Recycled concrete aggregates; Replacement materials; Replacement ratio; Strength characteristics; Strength property; Sustainable concretes; Sustainable materials; Carbon footprint; Compressive strength; Waste paper; Wastes; Recycling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872569135

In a center-staged LPP combustor, diffusion combustion in pilot stage and premixed combustion in main stage are combined to fulfill combustion performances and emission requirements under various operating conditions. Different from traditional combustor, since more air flows into flame tube through the dome, the airflow used for adjusting outlet temperature is very limited. Three-dimensional numerical simulations are carried out in the present investigation to analyze the influence of dilution holes on combustor outlet temperature distribution and NOx emissions. Five cases of dilution holes are simulated and analyzed. Realizable k-e model, partially premixed combustion model and discrete phase model are employed in present work. The simulation results show that there are high temperature regions between two adjacent domes under take off mode. Cases with dilution holes in position C achieve better OTDF. The more airflow issued from these dilution holes, the lower OTDF obtained. At the same time, the radial height of outlet circumferentially averaged temperature will be increased. Under idle mode, dilution holes in position D and E are both very useful to decrease OTDF, thus it would be beneficial to increase the size of dilution holes D and E to issue more dilution air while decreasing the size of hole C. Nevertheless this modification will deteriorate OTDF under take off mode. However, under take off and idle modes, most high temperature regions appears in upper side of outlet. Hence, increasing the percentage of dilution air flowing into the upper side of flame tube will decrease the RTDF and reduce the radial height of outlet maximum circumferentially averaged temperature. It is also found that the dilution air has little effect on NOx emission in all five cases, because the dilution holes are axially located in the downstream of the primary combustion area where most of NOx is produced.

In the paper, thermal energy production and thermal exchange loss used in living tissue is analyzed. The rule of thermal transfer that is irradiated by high power laser is discussed. The model of two dimensional skin tissues is built. The two dimensional transient temperature distribution generated by laser irradiation in bio-tissue is numerical simulated using finite element method. The temperature change trend generated by pulse laser and continuum laser in different radial length and axial depth bio-tissue are studied respectively. The results show that FEM method can reflect the photothermal conversion of bio-tissue exactly. Temperature is the highest in the local tissue by laser irradiated directly. The highest temperature decreases along with increasing radial length and axial depth. The highest temperature rise generated by pulse laser is more than continuum laser's. The highest temperature generated by pulse laser is not monotone increasing but is oscillation trend. The highest temperature generated by continuum laser is monotone increasing. The temperature rise mainly occurs in exodermis and derma. The temperature rise is not very significant in fat acid lining. © 2013 SPIE.","Bio-tissue; FEM; Laser; Temperature distribution","Bio-tissue; Biological tissues; Highest temperature; Numerical research; Numerical simulated; Photo-thermal conversions; Temperature changes; Two-dimensional transient; Carbonization; Finite element method; High power lasers; Lasers; Temperature distribution; Tissue; Two dimensional; Tissue engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888192542

This brine contains a large reservoir of reduced and aged carbon, and appears to be stable at decadal time scales: concentrations and isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) are similar to measurements made in the 1970s. Both DIC and DOC are more ""aged"" within the brine pool than in overlying water, and the isotopic contrast between brine carbon and seawater carbon is much greater for DIC than DOC. While the stable carbon isotopic composition of brine DIC points towards a combination of methane and organic carbon remineralization as its source, radiocarbon and box model results point to the brine interface as the major source region for DIC, allowing for only limited oxidation of methane diffusing upwards from sediments. This conclusion is consistent with previous studies that identify the seawater-brine interface as the focus of microbial activity associated with Orca Basin brine. Isotopic similarities between DIC and DOC suggest a different relationship between these two carbon reservoirs than is typically observed in deep ocean basins. Radiocarbon values implicate the seawater-brine interface region as the likely source region for DOC to the brine as well as DIC. © Author(s) 2013.",,"brine; carbon isotope; continental slope; isotopic composition; microbial activity; seawater; timescale; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Orca Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877958549

In response, environmental groups became more specialized and professional, learning how to effect policy change through the courts, states, and federal agencies rather than through grassroots movements. Without a significantly mobilized public and with a generally uncooperative Congress, presidents since the 1990s have been forced to step into a new role of increasing presidential dominance over environmental policies. Rather than working with Congress, presidents instead have employed unilateral actions and administrative strategies to further their environmental goals.Presidential Administration and the Environment offers a detailed examination of the strategies and tools used by U.S. presidents. Using primary sources from presidential libraries such as speeches and staff communications, David M. Shafie analyzes how presidents such as Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have used alternative executive approaches to pass environmental policies. From there, Shafie presents case studies in land management, water policy, toxics, and climate change. He analyzes the role that executive leadership has played in passing policies within these four areas, explains how this role has changed over time, and concludes by investigating how Obama's policies compare thus far with those of his predecessors. Shafie's combination of qualitative content analysis and topical case studies offers scholars and researchers alike important insights for understanding the interactions between environmental groups and the executive branch and the implications for future policymaking in the United States. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

Here, we compare unique CO2 system observations covering complete annual cycles at an Arctic (Amundsen Gulf) and Antarctic site (Prydz Bay). The Arctic site experiences greater seasonal warming (10 vs 3 °C), and freshening (3 vs 2), has lower alkalinity (2220 vs 2320 μmol/kg), and lower summer pH (8.15 vs 8.5), than the Antarctic site. Despite a larger uptake of inorganic carbon by summer photosynthesis, the Arctic carbon system exhibits smaller seasonal changes than the more alkaline Antarctic system. In addition, the excess surface nutrients in the Antarctic may allow mitigation of acidification, via CO2 removal by enhanced summer production driven by iron inputs from glacial and sea-ice melting. These differences suggest that the Arctic system is more vulnerable to anthropogenic change due to lower alkalinity, enhanced warming, and nutrient limitation.",,"sea water; sea water; Antarctica; Arctic; chemistry; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; ice cover; pH; season; article; chemistry; ice cover; Antarctic Regions; Arctic Regions; Ecosystem; Global Warming; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ice Cover; Seasons; Seawater; Antarctic Regions; Arctic Regions; Ecosystem; Global Warming; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ice Cover; Seasons; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881345036

The tropospheric zenith delay (ZTD) quantified in the GPS data analysis is closely related to the value of integrated water vapor above each GPS station. GPS ZTD is already successfully used for operational weather prediction and meteorological analyses, providing valuable data to improve our comprehension of the tropospheric water cycle and in particular to improve the prediction of precipitations. Moreover, GPS tropospheric measurements are intrinsically stable, so that long term observations represent a significant contribution to climatological studies. The results of a homogeneous reanalysis of up to 14 years of data with MIT's GAMIT/GLOBK software version 10.4 are presented. The estimated tropospheric parameters are 1 ZTD every 2 hours and one couple of horizontal tropospheric gradients (NS and EW) every 3 hours for each of the 181 stations, simultaneously with a daily positioning solution. A quality check of the tropospheric parameter time series identifies offsets, for example due to instrument changes at individual sites. The resulting verified time series can further be used for meteorological and climatological studies that go beyond the geodetic work presented here. Thanks to the length of the data set in time, a regional climatological approach could permit identifying specific patterns of ZTD variation that are related to severe weather events. The regional GPS stations could then contribute to an early warning system.","Climate; Databases; Geodesy; GPS; International Networks; Meteorology; Monitoring","Database systems; Geodesy; Geodetic satellites; Meteorology; Monitoring; Time series; Troposphere; Climate; Climatological analysis; Early Warning System; Integrated water vapors; International networks; Long term observations; Meteorological analysis; Severe weather events; Global positioning system",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924337509

Dual fuel describes the combination of a pressure and volume regulated stream of natural gas flowing through the engine intake and mixing with a reduced amount of injected diesel fuel in the engine to create power output that is nearly indistinguishable from using straight diesel fuel in high pressure fracturing pumps and other support equipment. Combining diesel fuel and natural gas in a dual fuel system reduces emissions of NOx, SOx, CO2, VOCs and particulates. Diesel fuel volume has been reduced by as much as 1,575 gallons per frac stage in field testing (63% of total fuel). Engine modification is with primarily bolt-on aftermarket and factory kits. Fuel savings vary depending on price and availability of the natural gas fuel source: LNG (liquid form) from existing liquefaction and/or storage infrastructure or CNG (gaseous form) from local distribution companies (LDC), and/or field gas or distribution gas pipeline systems. Learnings presented from field trials include a case history of frac jobs using CNG, LNG and other gas supply. Economic data is presented on the overall process. Recognition that availability of adequate CNG and LNG fuel supplies may be limiting expanded implementation of dual fuel technologies has prompted us to consider methods of making both fuel supplies more available to other industrial segments as well as the oil and gas industry.

In the Australian sugar industry, changes in maximum and minimum temperature, radiation and rainfall can significantly affect future economic and environmental sustainability. In northern regions an increase in rainfall during the harvest season can lead to crop standover and lower economic returns. Modelling the effects of climate change at a local scale will help develop regional management strategies. General Circulation Models (GCMs) allow researchers to explore projections of climate variables under a range of possible future emission scenarios. However, current outputs from GCMs are often only available at a coarse resolution (up to 300 km by 300 km). As a result many small scale conditions that can affect climate variables are often not represented in GCM outputs. Sugarcane in Australia is primarily grown in a narrow band on the eastern coast. The Tully region of northern Queensland is situated between the World Heritage Listed Wet Tropics Rainforest and Great Barrier Reef. Topographical changes across the Tully sugarcane-growing region result in climatology varying spatially. Downscaled GCMs can provide a bridge between large scale climate projections and the need for local climate variables. This paper explores climate change projections for maximum and minimum temperature, radiation and rainfall in the Tully sugarcane-growing region at a high spatial resolution. Temperature and rainfall data were obtained from 11 GCMs for the period 1961 to 2000. Projections for this period were based on 20th century forcings (20C3M) as described by the International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC). GCM projections for the period 2046 to 2065 were also obtained, based on a high emissions scenario (A2). A statistical downscaling methodology was used to downscale daily temperature and rainfall data on a 0.05 by 0.05 decimal degree grid (approximately 5 km by 5 km). Data were downscaled for grid locations known to grow sugarcane within the Tully region. Daily radiation data were not available using the downscaling process. Instead, daily radiation data were generated from downscaled rainfall and temperature data. Equations for daily radiation were parameterised using temperature and rainfall data from a nearby high quality weather station and calculated total solar flux. Estimates were bias corrected to replicate weather station records of radiation. The projected change in each of the four climate variables was assessed on a regional level for the 11 GCMs and spatial variations within the region were identified. For temperature and radiation variables, the absolute projected change was calculated. For rainfall the projected relative change was calculated. The relative change was defined as the percent change from the baseline period (1961 to 2000). Projected changes were analysed at each grid point for summer, autumn, winter and spring. The regional mean change was calculated for each GCM and a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval was produced for the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of the paired differences. The percentiles of projected change across the range of GCMs were used to capture the uncertainty between model projections. If the 95% confidence interval of the 50th and 75th (25th) percentile captured only positive (negative) values, an increase (decrease) was considered plausible. An increase (decrease) was considered highly plausible if the confidence intervals for the 25th 50th and 75th all captured positive (negative) values. For the Tully region, an increase in temperature was considered highly plausible for all seasons under A2 simulated forcings. A projected decrease in radiation was considered highly plausible for winter and spring and plausible for autumn. A relative increase in radiation was plausible for summer and a relative increase in rainfall was considered plausible for spring. However, projected changes in seasonal rainfall varied spatially within the Tully region. An increase in seasonal temperature and rainfall may require changes to traditional management strategies. High resolution climate change projections can help industry decision makers develop localised, robust adaptation strategies. Local adaptations are vital for an economically and environmentally sustainable future. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Downscale; GCM; Radiation; Rainfall; Temperature","Climate models; Decision making; Electric power system interconnection; Heat radiation; Industrial economics; Operations research; Radiation; Rain; Sugar industry; Sustainable development; Temperature; Weather information services; Climate change projections; Downscale; Environmental sustainability; General circulation model; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Modelling the effects of climate changes; Regional climate changes; Statistical downscaling; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080857007

Subpart W P""etroleum and Natural Gas Systems"" of 40 CFR 98 prescribes GHG emission estimation methodologies and reporting requirements for the oil and gas industry. One area where significant issues remain to be resolved is the estimation of GHG emissions from the act of flowing back gas wells following recent hydraulic fracturing operations. As an alternative to measuring the flowback volume of GHG emissions from a fractured well,EPA presentedequations for sonic and subsonic flow which appear to be derived from the ideal gas law. Anecdotal evidence from member companies of multiple trade organizations indicated that these equations may overestimate flow rates by as much as 600%. Noble Energy Inc.,withthe help of Trimeric Corporation,investigatedand evaluated empirical methods to estimate GHG emissions from flowback operations that follow hydraulic fracturing. A number of earlier developed correlations for multiphase flow were considered before choosing the Gilbert-type correlation as a potentially applicable equation for this case. The goal of this analysis was to compare the accuracy of the ideal gas type equation in a multiphase flow regime with a Gilbert-type predictive multiphase flow correlation using site-specific and field-regressed coefficients. Measured data for daily and total cumulative gas, water,andoil produced,chokesize,and tubing pressure for several wells within a field are needed to develop field-regressed coefficients for the Gilbert-type equation. However,oncethey have been determined,onesingular daily average value of choke size,tubingpressure,andrate of produced liquid (oil and water) are all that is required to predict the total volume of produced gas emissions for other flowback operations in the field. The results of this study indicate that the Gilbert-type correlation using field-regressed coefficients predicts the overall volume of gas produced during a flowback operation more accurately than the ideal-gas type EPA equation W-11B in 40 CFR 98.

Here we consider how OA might impact echino-derms by considering two contrasting reproductive strategies in sea urchins: planktotrophic larvae, and the brooded young of deep-sea Antarctic echinoids. In planktotrophic sea urchins previous research has shown that larvae developing in elevated CO2 are smaller, with skeletal abnormalities at high [CO2]. Recent research with Lytechinus pictus using gene expression profiling further shows that numerous genes central to energy metabolism and biomineralization are down-regulated in high CO2 conditions. Skeletal formation in adult Antarctic sea urchins, and their developing broods, is also likely to be affected by shallowing of the high Mg-calcite saturation horizon, potentially impacting growth, bathymetric distribution and local population persistence. Thus, OA will affect sea urchins with both brooding and larval developmental modes, suggesting broad-scale impacts on other calcified echinoderm classes. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis Group.",,"Carbonate concentrations; Developmental mode; Elevated CO; Energy metabolism; Gene expression profiling; Local populations; Marine ecosystem; Reproductive strategy; Sea urchin; Acidification; Biomineralization; Gene expression; Mammals; Shellfish; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871209748

Several conclusions were drawn from the results; first, in order to promote mass transit, the area's residential and commercial features must be intensified through a combination of mixed-use and a low ratio of road. Second, the transit modal choice analysis revealed that accessibility to mass transit is an important variable in determining its usage, along with the number of blocks per unit area and the pedestrian environment of the vicinity. Third, the results suggest that strengthening city-wide reliance on mass transit is effective in reducing environmental hazards to a significant degree: with a ridership ratio increase expected in the range of 3.5 to 5.9%, the resulting decreased road traffic would reduce CO 2 emissions by 391 to 686 thousand tons. Finally, in terms of boosting the regional economy, higher pedestrian volumes of commuters would increase annual income for neighborhood retailers in the range of 7.4 to 13.6 million dollars.","Carbon reduction; Modal choice model; Regional revitalization; Transit-oriented corridor; Transit-oriented development","Decision making; Environmental impact; Mass transportation; Regional planning; Regression analysis; Roads and streets; Carbon reduction; Modal choice; Regional revitalization; Transit oriented development; Transit-oriented corridor; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884398414

However many cities neglect to assess whether the growth required for achieving increased density would lead to overall reductions in municipal emissions. Our study conducts this assessment by examining the potential impact of development that conforms to a form-based code in Revelstoke, British Columbia. Like every city in British Columbia, Revelstoke has set GHG emissions reductions targets and has specifically identified compact development as facilitated by a form-based code as a mechanism for achieving targets. Using a number of different data sources ranging from municipal to parcel scales we constructed a neighbourhood specific GHG inventory and tested twelve design scenarios in one of the Revelstoke's identified neighbourhood centres. Our study examined how increasing density to thresholds that would enable both transportation mode shifts and the adoption of district energy systems, would affect municipal level GHG emissions. While we found opportunities for significantly reducing per capita emissions in the denser neighbourhoods, Revelstoke's total GHG emissions would increase even under the highest density scenarios. This work has broader implications for the capacity of compact development to reduce emissions without a simultaneous decommissioning of sprawling high emitting neighbourhoods.

Provincial legislation in the Canadian province of British Columbia has recently mandated that all municipalities adopt targets for reducing greenhousegas emissions. Lack of specificity in the legislation gives rise to the possibility that even if compliance with the legislation is universal it could nonetheless result in minimal reductions in emissions releases. This article examines the response to the legislation of twenty municipalities in British Columbia's most populous regions. We hypothesized that noncompliance would be rampant and that cities with large populations, high residential densities, lower growth rates, and prior climate change planning work would set more ambitious targets. However, findings indicate that municipal targets vary widely in terms of intensity, target year, and type of reduction and have little or no relationship to population, residential density, or growth rate. We found 90% compliance and some correlation between prior planning activities related to climate change and target intensity. Findings also indicate that despite the wide range of emissions targets by each municipality, provincial per capita targets would be met if each municipality were to achieve the targets that they have set by the 2050 target year. © 2012 Senbel et al.","Climatic change; Emission reduction; Government regulation; Legislation; Mitigation; Urban planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874671970

In this regard this paper analyses the improvement of energy security which occurs as a result of energy efficiency (EE) improvements in the power sector. In this paper energy security is measured along three main themes which are oil security, gas security and sustainability. The energy systems of the selected countries, namely Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam are modeled using an integer programming based optimization model called Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General Environmental Impacts - MESSAGE. Each country is modeled with two scenarios namely the reference scenario which maintains the status quo at the start year and the EE scenario which models EE options in the demand side as supply side alternatives. The time horizon is 2007-2030, where 2007 is the base year and 2030 is the end year. The results are presented for oil security, gas security, sustainability, and also for co-benefits such as mitigation of CO2 emissions, reduction in conventional primary energy use and reduction of local air pollutants such as SO2 and NOx. Results show that energy efficiency in Sri Lanka significantly increases the energy security whilst also accruing co-benefits of CO2 mitigation, mitigation of local air pollution and reducing the conventional primary energy use. In the case of Thailand and Vietnam, energy security is enhanced in the earlier years (2007-2015), but in the longer term of modeling horizon (2020-2030) energy security of both the reference and EE scenarios converge indicating that in terms of long term energy security implementing energy efficiency measures alone would not enhance energy security. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Co-benefits; Energy security; Gas security; Oil security; Sustainability","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Energy security; Gas emissions; Integer programming; Sustainable development; Co benefits; Efficiency measure; Energy efficiency improvements; Local air pollutions; Mitigation of co2; Oil security; Optimization modeling; Primary energy use; Energy efficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872466134

Two different transport approaches are compared, both utilizing groundwater flow simulations of future climate conditions. The first transport approach uses steady-state particle trajectories representing temperate climate conditions, but modifies the transport velocity along the trajectories according to the changing climate. The second approach is pseudo-transient by performing particle tracking in each individual flow field representing a given time epoch.Two different climate sequences are analyzed. First, a simplified sequence is assessed in order to understand if the two different transport approaches yield significantly different breakthrough characteristics. Second, a sequence representing conditions relevant for real safety assessment applications is considered.Results indicate that the transport approach using fixed trajectories tends to significantly over predict breakthrough during permafrost conditions relative to the pseudo-transient approach.

Low-temperature combustion was achieved using multiple-late injection (MLI), intake boost, and cooled EGR. Advanced injection and valvetrain were key enablers. In the current study, a new piston was developed and matched with the injection system. Single-cylinder engine tests were conducted with the objective to reduce injection pressure, intake boost, and swirl levels. Results showed that ISFC could be further improved while maintaining low levels of NOx, PM, and combustion noise. Efficiency loss analysis indicated a very efficient thermodynamic process with greatly reduced heat losses. Injection parameters could be used to control combustion phasing with good combustion stability. Engine simulations were performed to develop a practical boost system for GDCI. Sufficient intake boosting is difficult for low-temperature-combustion engines because the exhaust enthalpy to drive a turbocharger is very low. Several boost architectures with various boost devices were studied. A two-stage system with a supercharger, a turbocharger, and two charge coolers was selected and optimized using simulation-based calibration techniques. Results showed that attractive BSFC levels over the operating range with good full-load BMEP could be obtained. Subsequent vehicle simulations showed greatly reduced fuel consumption relative to a GDI baseline on both urban and highway drive cycles. Engine down-sizing, down-speeding, and up-loading with good transmission matching were key factors to achieve the most efficient operation. A multi-cylinder GDCI engine was designed and built. Preliminary parametric tests were conducted on an engine dynamometer and compared to single-cylinder tests at similar operating conditions. Overall, results for the two engines were comparable for ISFC with combustion noise, NOx, and PM emissions below targets. More work is needed to characterize the engine over the operating map, conduct cold starts and transient tests, and optimize the powertrain calibration for minimum fuel consumption at target emissions levels.

The research method was the qualitative modeling. The model was constructed by experts in environmental management and transport management in a focus group session conducted by researchers. Environmental performance is the measurable results of the environmental management system (EMS) of a business activity, constructed according to the environmental policy of the company, its business objectives and environmental targets. Environmental performance was treated as an intangible variate, structured in latent constructs and indicators. From the assessment process results an overall index ranging between 0 and 100 %. Five constructs were used in the model: atmospheric emissions; effluents; solid waste; urban land use; and use of natural resources. The constructs were prioritized with the aid of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The meanings of the constructs were apprehended by 33 indicators. The model was tested in three bus transit operations in different areas of a Brazilian city of 1,500,000 inhabitants. Indicators were assessed by scales fulfilled by managers of the operations. The overall results were: operator A = 62.39 %; operator B = 68.02 %; and operator C = 65.30 %. For the three operators, the construct that most contributed to the overall performance to stay away from 100 % was atmospheric emissions. In future actions, management of the companies should focus on the indicators that compose the construct, mainly greenhouse gas (GHG) and black smoke emissions, in order to control the variate and eventually improve the environmental performance. The second prioritization for the operators is land use, mainly damage on pavements and traffic congestion.

Supercritical carbon dioxide and synthetical brine were injected under in situ reservoir p/T-conditions at an average flow rate of 0.1 mL/min for 256 h. X-ray computed microtomographic imaging was carried out before and after the core-flooding experiment at a spatial voxel resolution of 27μm. No significant changes in microstructure were found at the tomographic imaging resolution including porosity and pore size distribution, except of an increase of depositional heterogeneous distribution of clay minerals in the pores. The 3D images were used as direct real microstructure input to the GeoDict software package, to simulate Navier-Stokes flow by a lattice Boltzmann equation solver.

In this paper, we introduce the idea of combining two efficient OOB emissions reduction techniques (the shaping and the advanced cancellation carriers (ACC)). These two techniques are chosen to enable considerable reduction at all frequencies in the OOB regions while at the same time to utilize the available resources. Also, these techniques do not require performing complex optimizations (which is essential for practical implementations).

New experimental data are provided. Some of them concern impacts of a 500μm diameter steel sphere at velocities above 4000 m/s on thick carbon targets, leading to strong debris ejection and cratering. A high speed frame camera showed the debris velocity distribution to lie in the 10-200 m/s range. Post-mortem tomographies have also been performed. They reveal some subsurface cracks, but also provide some evidence that the fragmented sphere lies below the target surface. Dynamic loadings involving similar energy densities (above 2000 J/cm2) can also be reached through the interaction of a nanosecond intense laser focalized on a carbon target. An experimental result obtained on a laser facility is presented. Numerical simulations have been performed in order to explain the observed results. An Eulerian hydrocode has been chosen because of the large deformation occurring under considered experiments. We have used a classical model to describe the porous behavior, including equation of state, elasticity, shear strength and densification. In this paper, we focus on the effect of the addition to this porous model of a failure criterion relying on the Weibull theory.

The model includes dynamical compartments of the atmosphere and ocean and interactive modules of the terrestrial biosphere as well as ocean biogeochemistry. The MPIESM was forced with anomalies of aerosol optical depth and effective radius of aerosol particles corresponding to a super eruption of the Yellowstone volcanic system. The model experiment consists of an ensemble of fifteen model integrations that are started at different pre-ENSO states of a control experiment and run for 200 years after the volcanic eruption. The climate response to the volcanic eruption is a maximum global monthly mean surface air temperature cooling of 3.8K for the ensemble mean and from 3.3K to 4.3K for individual ensemble members. Atmospheric pCO2 decreases by a maximum of 5 ppm for the ensemble mean and by 3 ppm to 7 ppm for individual ensemble members approximately 6 years after the eruption. The atmospheric carbon content only very slowly returns to near pre-eruption level at year 200 after the eruption. The ocean takes up carbon shortly after the eruption in response to the cooling, changed wind fields and ice cover. This physics-driven uptake is weakly counteracted by a reduction of the biological export production mainly in the tropical Pacific. The land vegetation pool shows a decrease by 4 GtC due to reduced short-wave radiation that has not been present in a smaller scale eruption. The gain of the soil carbon pool determines the amplitude of the CO2 perturbation and the long-term behaviour of the overall system: an initial gain caused by reduced soil respiration is followed by a rather slow return towards pre-eruption levels. During this phase, the ocean compensates partly for the reduced atmospheric carbon content in response to the land's gain. In summary, we find that the volcanic eruption has long-lasting effects on the carbon cycle: After 200 years, the ocean and the land carbon pools are still different from the pre-eruption state by 3 GtC and 4 GtC, respectively, and the land carbon pools (vegetation and soil) show some long-lasting local anomalies that are only partly visible in the global signal. © Author(s) 2013.

In this context, the use of advanced modelling tools, able to evaluate particle concentration under different traffic and meteorological conditions, may be helpful. In this work, a numerical scheme based on the non-commercial fully explicit AC-CBS algorithm, and the one-equation Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model, was developed to perform numerical simulations of fluid flow and ultrafine particle dispersion in different street canyon configurations and under different wind speed and traffic conditions. The proposed non-commercial numerical tool was validated through a comparison with data drawn from the scientific literature. The results obtained from ultrafine particle concentration simulations show that as the building height increases the dispersion of particles in the canyon becomes weaker, due to the restricted interaction between the flow field in the street canyon and the undisturbed flow. Higher values of approaching wind speed facilitate the dispersion of the particles. The traffic effect has been evaluated by imposing different values of particles emission, depending on the vehicles type, with the lowest concentration values obtained for the Euro 6 vehicles, and the highest for High Duty Vehicles. A parametric analysis was also performed concerning the exposure to particles of pedestrians in different positions at the road level as a function of street canyon geometry, traffic mode, and wind speed. The worst exposure (1.25 × 106 part./cm3) was found at the leeward side for an aspect ratio H/W = 1, wind speed of 5 m/s when High Duty Vehicles traffic was considered. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Modelling; Street canyon; Turbulence; Ultrafine particles","Concentration values; Meteorological condition; Parametric -analysis; Particle concentrations; Scientific literature; Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model; Street canyon; Ultrafine particle; Aspect ratio; Computer simulation; Dispersions; Flow fields; Models; Numerical models; Tools; Transportation; Turbulence; Turbulence models; Vehicles; Wall flow; Wind effects; Computer integrated manufacturing; dispersion; flow field; fluid flow; geometry; numerical model; particulate matter; simulation; street canyon; turbulence; wind velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885084717

The subset of the LEED buildings certified at the Gold level outperformed other NYC office buildings by 20%. In contrast LEED Silver and Certified office buildings underperformed other NYC office buildings. The average EPR for the LEED buildings was 78, 10 pts higher than that for all NYC office buildings, raising questions about the validity and interpretation of these EPR's. This work suggests that LEED building certification is not moving NYC toward its goal of climate neutrality. The results also suggest the need to re-examine some aspects of ENERGY STAR's benchmarking tool. © 2013 John H. Scofield. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It poses some questions, such as: what are the implications of international trends relating to trade and carbon emissions reduction schemes for Caribbean SIDS’ competitiveness from the perspective of environmental justice and the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities? While there have been several studies on SIDS’ vulnerability to climate change, they focus mostly on the effect of climatic events, especially natural disasters and sea level rise, on island states, and consequent adaptation efforts and challenges. This paper draws attention to one way in which the global fight for a green economy works to the detriment of Caribbean SIDS. Climate regulation in the areas of maritime and air transport make long hauls more expensive and reduce the trade competitiveness of Caribbean SIDS. Both in the case of regulation of international transport, and in the case of carbon border taxes being applied to imports, the special vulnerabilities of SIDS have not led to special treatment for these countries. This paper argues that this aspect of climate change regulation requires specific attention at the international and domestic level. The trade and environment discourse must consider the special development challenges and vulnerabilities of SIDS if the principles of justice, fairness and common but differentiated responsibilities are to be observed. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Carbon border taxes; Caribbean SIDS; Climate change; Maritime and aviation emission schemes; Principle of common but differentiated responsibility; Trade competitiveness",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071504648

The framework is based on principles from place attachment theory, placebased education, free-choice learning, and norm activation theory. The framework, which we empirically validate here, demonstrates the power of engaging citizens in action-based learning at physical, material places, which are also symbolic sites for inspiring political action and learning about climate change impacts. Research has shown that climate change will resonate with diverse audiences when: (1) it is situated in cultural values and beliefs, (2) it is meaningful to that audience, and (3) it empowers specific action. We use data collected at 16 national parks and wildlife refuges in the USA; all of which are experiencing the impacts of climate change and struggling to develop climate change communication and outreach activities for their visitors and local communities. Thus, this framework and the empirical validation presented are the result of triangulating quantitative survey data (n-4,181) and qualitative interviews (n- 359) to argue for the unparalleled potential for America's parks and refuges to inspire civic engagement in climate change through place-based communication. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.","Climate Change; Mixed Method Approach; National parks; National wildlife refuges; Place-based public engagement framework",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878316792

The greatest concentrations of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) are emitted along heavily trafficked major roadways from which the associated detrimental effects of TRAP exposure have been well-established (HEI Panel on the Health Effects of Traffic-Related Air Pollution (2010)). Consequently, populations residing near major roadways have the greatest likelihood of potential exposure to TRAP and a high risk of experiencing adverse health effects. We investigate pollution exposure levels for Adelaide residents in heavily trafficked areas by modelling and simulating TRAP emissions and movement in the atmosphere, with the development of an enhanced Link Emissions Modelling procedure for South Australia. The current Link Emissions Model (CLEM) for South Australia uses emission factors developed overseas and is based on a single average speed. The enhanced Link Emissions Model uses petrol passenger vehicle emissions and vehicle speed data from the second National In-Service Emissions study, to derive new Australian emission factors for use in South Australia. The result is the petrol passenger vehicle Link Emissions Model, PLEM. In essence, PLEM is an augmented version of CLEM, however provides the advantages of accommodating a range of vehicle speeds and is based on Australian data. The enhanced Link Emissions Modelling procedure for South Australia estimates road link TRAP emissions through the use of PLEM for petrol passenger vehicles in conjunction with CLEM for all other vehicle types. The enhanced Link Emissions Model is implemented in a case study of selected densely trafficked roadways near residential areas of Adelaide, South Australia, to assess population TRAP exposure levels and the current air quality status in Adelaide. Vehicular exhaust emissions are estimated for each road link in the case study area using the enhanced Link Emissions Model. The Air Pollution Model (TAPM), an air quality tool for pollution dispersion, is used to analyse the movement of the link emission estimates in the atmosphere with pollution exposure maps showing approximate pollution concentrations for the case study region, generated by combining TAPM output with Geographic Information Systems data. Results of the case study indicate that TRAP concentrations are greatest over main roads and their intersections, with pollutant concentrations declining with increasing distance from the main roads. Pollution concentrations fluctuate across the week, with each day typically experiencing two peaks in air pollution concentrations corresponding to peak traffic hours. The lowest pollution concentrations occur during the early hours of a day when traffic volumes are typically lowest. Furthermore, the results suggest TRAP concentrations are subject to seasonal variation with the greatest concentrations occurring during the calm, cold weather conditions of winter and the lowest concentrations occurring during the windy, warm summer season. Atmospheric vehicle exhaust pollution concentrations in the case study area of Adelaide are comfortably below the threshold levels specified by the World Health Organisation however Adelaide residents are exposed to a notable volume of vehicular exhaust pollution. Thus mitigation strategies for TRAP emission and exposure should be designed and implemented for South Australia. The case study results indicate use of the enhanced Link Emissions Model provides a strong understanding of approximate pollution concentrations in the Adelaide air shed, forming a solid platform upon which to base future informed strategies for emission reduction and exposure mitigation. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Dispersion; Emissions; Exposure; Motor vehicles; Pollution","Air quality; Dispersion (waves); Emission control; Gasoline; Health; Health risks; Operations research; Particulate emissions; Pollution; Roads and streets; Air Pollution Modeling; Exposure; Motor vehicle; Motor vehicle emissions; Pollutant concentration; Pollution concentration; Traffic-related air pollution; Vehicular exhaust emissions; Road vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080959775

The important synergistic impacts coexisting with freshwater scarcity are increasing urbanization rates, subsiding soils, saltwater intrusion in aquifers and rivers, coastal erosion, and increased flooding. Innovative design strategies and concepts for the integration of decentralized rainwater management measures can contribute to the integrated and climate resilient planning of urban spaces that are threatened by climate change scenarios that worsen the security of urban infrastructures and the future availability of fresh water. Decentralized rainwater management, including retention, storage, and reuse strategies that are integrated into spatial planning and urban design, can reduce flood risks while simultaneously enhancing freshwater availability. This paper discusses a paradigm shift in urban water management, from centralized to decentralized management (that is, from threats to opportunities), using the example of two case studies. Concepts and strategies for building climate resilient cities, which address flood control, the protection of freshwater resources, and the harmonization of a natural and more sustainable water balance, are presented for Almere (Rhine Schelde Delta, The Netherlands) and Hsingchu (Dotzpu Delta, Taiwan). © 2013 by the authors;.","Almere; Climate change; Climate resilience; Decentralized rainwater management; Flooding; Freshwater scarcity; Hsingchu; Urban development","Aquifers; Availability; Climate change; Design; Flood control; Floods; Hydrogeology; Oil well flooding; Urban growth; Water; Water conservation; Almere; Climate resilience; Freshwater scarcity; Hsingchu; Rainwater management; Urban development; Water management; climate change; coastal zone management; decentralization; flooding; freshwater; rainwater; sustainability; urban design; urban development; urban planning; urbanization; water availability; water management; water resource; Almere; Flevoland; Hsinchu; Netherlands; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883189039
