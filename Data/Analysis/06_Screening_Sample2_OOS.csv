Taking two national grain-producing regions in China, Shandong and Dongting Lake Region as examples, this study uses step-by-step prediction and a double-objective linear programming model to analyze the dilemma of land scarcity, food demand, and environmental load. It is found that food demand by 2030 will induce partial regional cropland deficiency and heterogeneous agro-environmental risk among cities. The double-objective linear programming model finds possible solutions in different scenarios: on the premise of keeping the current cropland area unchanged, the upper threshold of crop yield by 2030 will be 2539.06 Ãƒâ€” 104 t in Dongting and 7175.13 Ãƒâ€” 104 t in Shandong, respectively. On the condition of guaranteeing food self-sufficiency and minimizing the environmental load, the lower threshold of arable land area should be 99.47 Ãƒâ€” 104 ha in Dongting and 436.85 Ãƒâ€” 104 ha in Shandong. Pollutant reduction will be realized by reallocation of agro-production task and optimized practices. The food carbon impact can be reduced by up to 1.27 kg CO2 eq/kg. This study contributes to feasible pathways towards adequate agro-production, lessened land scarcity, and minimal environmental risk for rapid urbanizing cities in a sustainable way.

A case study of four municipalities in China","Ma, MD; Cai, WG","Decoupling economic development from carbon emissions generated from China's commercial buildings (CECCB) is regarded as an important indicator for evaluating the energy efficiency of the commercial building sector in China. Our study is the first to propose a decoupling method based on a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition analysis with the Kaya identity to analyze the relationship between economic development in China's Tertiary Industry and the CECCB growth at both national and municipal levels. The following three main results are found. (1) At the national level, commercial building sector decoupling from 2001 to 2015 is limited. Only four decoupling stages are observed at the municipal level with the ordering of municipal decoupling measured as follows: Tianjin > Beijing > Shanghai > Chongqing (2001-2010), Chongqing > Beijing > Tianjin > Shanghai (2011-2015). (2) Two extended versions of Environmental Kuznets Curves further show what drives different decoupling levels in the four municipalities. (3) More significant decoupling effects observed in recent years can be attributed to significant improvements made in the energy efficiency work of China's commercial building sector. Overall, our approach successfully covers a research gap relevant to the decoupling of the relationship between CECCB growth and the economic development of China's Tertiary Industry. Furthermore, we believe our results can be used to guide the evaluation of energy efficiency work in China's commercial building sector, and such efforts can also enrich diverse research conducted on China's low carbon economic systems.

It focuses on a regional measurement and comparison of these undesirable outputs of Chinese firm activities, such as industrial SO2 and CO2 emissions. By applying a data envelopment analysis-slack-based measure (DEA-SBM) model with undesirable outputs indicators, the regional innovation efficiency was evaluated for 30 provinces in China, from 2002 to 2014. The results indicate that the sustainable innovation efficiency of overall China is still relatively low, and varies significantly in different regions. Central and Western China have similar sustainable innovation efficiencies, which are much lower than the sustainable innovation efficiency in Eastern China. Furthermore, the data indicate that regional sustainable innovation efficiency disparities among these three areas are decreasing. Based on these findings, reasons for the sustainable innovation efficiency gap among the different regions were analyzed. To scholars, this paper extends the research on regional sustainable innovation efficiency by implementing an undesirable output perspective to the DEA-SBM model. The findings also provide Chinese policy makers with useful decision support insights for regional sustainable innovation, and energy conservation and emission reduction policies.

One of the strategies, named here the image conservation approach, consists of renovating the building with very efficient solutions, except for the brick-facing walls, which will only have insulation in the existing cavities. The other strategy, the image coordination approach, consists of renovating the whole building with efficient solutions, including external insulation for existing brick-facing walls, and drawing up coordination plans for each of the residential estates in order to guarantee a coordinated new image of the residential estates. By means of three case studies in the city of Zaragoza and four scenarios of improvement, the two strategies are compared regarding the regulation compliance, the energy use, the emissions reduction, the thermal comfort, and the cost-effectiveness of the measures. The results show that the image coordination approach is the best strategy in regard to the studied aspects, achieving a 69%-79% reduction of CO2 emissions and a 75%-97% reduction of heating use, as well as being the only one capable of transforming these buildings into nearly zero energy buildings (nZEBs).

As a result, more research is needed to facilitate the design and implementation of feasible and transparent adaptation strategies for cultural resources under changing climate conditions. In this paper, we begin to explore the challenges and opportunities that face cultural resource managers as they begin to grapple with climate change adaptation planning in dynamic coastal environments. Specifically, we provide an overview of a value-focused, decision-analytic approach that was applied in a pilot test of climate adaptation planning for buildings within designated historic districts on the barrier islands of Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina. We provide descriptions of the challenges that are uniquely facing cultural resource managers and initial evidence of the utility of this type of approach for informing judgments by presenting pre- and post-workshop survey data. Although additional research is critical to offer planning and policy guidance, we found that structured deliberations about cultural resource adaptation planning not only influenced participantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ opinions but also provided a necessary space to better understand the complexities of climate and budget uncertainties. Our evaluation is a first step at documenting the difficult and value-laden decisions that must be addressed by cultural resource managers as fiscal constraints and impending climate impacts threaten the traditional approach of preservation in perpetuity.

To explore urban greenhouse gas peak pathways, a city-level Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emission Analysis model was developed by using Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning model framework. Using the city of Guangzhou as a case study, this research compiled a overall energy balance sheet of base year and simulated future CO2 emission trends from 2015 to 2030 under three scenarios. Results show that CO2 emissions in Guangzhou will peak around 2023 under the current policy scenario. In order to advance the CO2 emissions peak to 2020, the more stringent emissions-reduction policies and measures need to be adopted under the peaking scenario and enhanced peaking scenario, with the peak emission value of 125Ã¢â‚¬â€œ127 Mt CO2e. The industrial sector is the only sector in which CO2 emissions have peaked in Guangzhou, the building sector's CO2 emissions will not peak by 2030 under any of the three scenarios, while the transportation sector, which will contribute 50 percent of emission reduction potential, is the key to achieve its goal of peaking CO2 emissions on time. In the short term, stringent reduction strategies on the transportation, industrial, and power sectors are needed, including transport mode adjustment, industrial structure adjustment, electrification level improvement, clean-up transformation of thermal power, and energy efficiency improvement. However, in the long term, reduction strategies for the building sector, like energy efficiency improvement and large-scale application of renewable energy, will be essential for Guangzhou.

Consumption-based policies could complement current carbon emissions mitigation actions, but such studies at the city level are relatively rare. We used a demand-driven input-output model to explore a historical time series (1987Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2012) of consumption-based emissions in Tianjin for the first time, a typical industrial city which has the largest carbon footprint in China. The results reveal the differences between consumption- and production-based emissions, and Tianjin has transformed from a producer city into a typical consumer city since 2000s, mainly due to infrastructure construction. There is more capital investment in industrial infrastructures than in real estate in Tianjin, causing the largest carbon footprint. The trade deficit and different carbon intensity have substantial influences on consumption-based emissions. Finally, population, income, and urbanization could enable a more accurate interpretation of urban carbon footprint growth. Demand-driven policy implications for addressing these emissions in booming industrial cities are discussed and provide a new perspective on carbon emissions mitigation.

Using four Chinese megacities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing) as case studies, we analyzed the factors that influenced per capita carbon emissions from 2010 to 2015. The results showed that per capita carbon emissions increased in Tianjin and Chongqing whereas decreased in Beijing and Shanghai, and that manufacturing was a key driving force. In these four megacities, energy conservation strategies were successfully implemented despite poor energy structure optimization during 2010Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2015. Development of manufacturing and improvement of resident living standards in the cities led to an increase in carbon emissions.

The development of economy has brought lots of carbon emissions. To explore an effective way to reduce carbon emissions, we applied the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model to find drivers behind carbon emission from 2003 to 2013. Results showed that, in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, economic output was main contributor to carbon emissions. Then we utilized the decoupling model to comprehensively analyze the relationship between economic output and carbon emission. Based on the two-level model, results indicated the following: (1) Industry sector accounted for almost 80% of energy consumption in whole region. The reduced proportion of industrial GDP will directly reduce the carbon emissions. (2) The carbon factor for CO2/energy in whole region was higher than that of Beijing and Tianjin but lower than that of Hebei. The impact of energy structure on carbon emission depends largely on the proportion of coal in industry. (3) The energy intensity in whole region decreased from 0.79 in 2003 to 0.40 in 2013 (unit: tons of standard coal/ten thousand yuan), which was lower than national average.

In line with other geographic regions, Mexico has seen the need to expand the options of market instruments to mitigate the effects of climate change. Simultaneously, there are important reasons to move towards a circular economy model. In this context, this research seeks to answer if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s feasible to implement a cap-and-trade system in Mexico as part of its climate policy. That said, firstly, it analyses and assesses the cap-and-trade system in Mexico based upon its contextual environment, its potential of implementation and its economic and environmental benefits and costs. Secondly, it highlights the implications of considering circular economy models into a cap-and-trade instrument. Through the use of marginal abatement cost curves (MACC), it was found that the percentage of measures to reduce GHG with negative cost agglomerates 57% of all the measures, which could translate into a benefit for the economy as a whole by almost 1% of GDP by 2020. As part of the conclusions, we argued that MACC results prove partially that the cap-and-trade system is a feasible option to apply in Mexico. In addition, a cap-and-trade mechanism should show a strong carbon price signal felt by end users and therefore motivates the application of circular economy principles, which are related to the introduction of innovations to enable the closing of current materials and energy loops along the supply production chain.

Only since the 90s of the last century, countries and international communities began to take concrete quantitative commitments to reduce emissions that directly affect climate change. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), adopted in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 [1], was ratified by the Russian Federation in 1994. To achieve the final goal of the said framework convention, a protocol was adopted in 1997 in Kyoto [2], signed by Russia in 1999 and ratified by it in 2004. According to Stage I of the Kyoto Protocol, the total average annual emissions of the Russian Federation must not exceed the average annual level of greenhouse gas emissions achieved in 1990. Penalties for withdrawal from the agreement and noncompliance were not provided. To achieve the final goal of the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in connection with the end of the Kyoto Protocol in 2015, a climate agreement was adopted in Paris [3], signed by Russia in 2016 and ratified by it in 2019. According to the Paris Agreement, the volume of total average annual greenhouse gas emissions in the Russian Federation by 2030 should not exceed 75% of the 1990 baseline emissions. The so-called 'carbon tax', which was repeatedly mentioned in the documents of the Paris Climate Conference, was not included in the decisions of the Paris Agreement on climate change, but at present, the WTO rules do not directly prohibit the introduction of such taxes. In this regard, the methodology for choosing the type of an isolated power supply system taking into account the 'carbon footprint' becomes especially important.

Scenario analysis of Jiangsu Province","Li D., Huang G., Zhu S., Chen L., Wang J.","China has become the world's largest carbon emitter, and its commitment to peak carbon emissions by 2030 is important for global development. The construction industry is one of China's biggest carbon emitters, and its peak has a direct impact on China's carbon commitment. Due to the regional heterogeneity of different provinces, the carbon emission of construction industry (CECI) at provincial level is of unique significance. To accurately predict the peak of provincial CECI, a prediction model was established by system dynamics, including direct CECI, indirect CECI and operational CECI. Taking Jiangsu province as an example, the single and multiple scenario settings with increasing R&D investment, promoting energy-saving buildings and implementing carbon trading from 2016 to 2030 was carried out, indicating that: 1) Without any carbon emission reduction measures, the CECI would maintain an annual growth rate of 5.58% to reach 530.61 million tons by 2030, and the indirect and operational CECI account for the majority of total with an average annual growth rate of 8.02% and 2.79% respectively. 2) All three measures had good carbon reduction effects, which would reduce the total CECI by 26.46% 21.68% and 10.68% respectively by 2030, but only when implemented simultaneously can CECI peak before 2030, 308.77 million tons at 2029. In the end, three policy implications was put forward. The framework presented in this paper provided a basis for the prediction of peak CECI in a province or state, which can help policy makers plan a more reasonable low-carbon development roadmap.

Different approaches to stakeholder communication and engagement planning have been used, based on specific city context, including history of engagement and current plans and ambitions. Riga stakeholders have been identified and prioritised using a matrix tool, allowing stakeholders to be grouped according to their importance for the enhanced SEAP and level of interest or engagement in the city. Riga has completed public consultation roundtables on its enhanced SEAP. Key stakeholders and their groups that have been identified include academia, local and regional administrations, industry and commerce, finance, energy suppliers and citizens. Riga working to engage all relevant stakeholder groups to help them move towards smart city status - including information and communication technology (ICT) partners, innovation bodies and international companies - in the process of developing and implementing the enhanced SEAP. As a result the city is making connections between players of energy, transport and ICT and increasing their role in CO2 emissions' reduction, and recognising opportunities of cross-sectoral actions and transfer of the best practice projects in synchrony with relevant local stakeholders, international companies and banks to roll out innovative sustainable energy solutions at a scale. Gaps in current stakeholder communication have also been identified, including insufficient recognition of job creation potential by engaging employment agencies, closer engagement with the transport sector companies, ensuring sufficient citizens' engagement, and building on existing relationships with ICT players. Riga has developed communication tools and stakeholder engagement plan based on analysis of the know-how and resources held by each of the stakeholders or their groups and their role in, and potential impact on the SEAP.

Hierarchical cluster analysis method using complete linkage technique was successfully applied for appropriate grouping. Six groups were categorized through GHG emission properties with major and minor emission sectors based on the GHG inventory covering energy, industrial processes, agriculture, waste, land use change, and forestry and bunker fuels. Assigning six groups using cluster analysis finally implied that the approach to establish GHG emission boundaries was meaningful to develop further mitigation strategies. Following the outcome of this study, calculating amount of reduction potential in suitable sectors as well as determining best practice, technology, and regulatory framework can be improved by policy makers, environmental scientists, and planners at the different levels. Therefore, this work on reviewing a wide range of GHG emission history and establishing boundaries of emission characteristics would provide further direction of effective climate change mitigation for sustainability and resilience in Asia.

The livelihood of Indigenous peoples in the northwestern Brazilian Amazon are characterized by complex ecological management systems entwined with sociocultural practices and sophisticated astronomical and ecological calendars. Sustainability of fisheries and bitter manioc production, key elements of food systems and economic activities in this region, depend on cyclic high river levels for fish spawning as well as periods of dry days for preparation of agricultural fields. Since 2005, participatory research has been underway between Indigenous communities of the Tiqui, River and the Brazilian Socio-environmental Institute (ISA). Indigenous agents of environmental management (AIMAs) keep notebooks of ethno-astronomical, ecological, and socio-economic observations of the annual cycles, and some of them have reported that river levels and dry periods have become more irregular in some years. To investigate how these possible climatic changes may impact the sustainability of resources, we share knowledge from the Tukano ecological calendar with methodology for examining changes in precipitation and river levels and their interactions at multiple timescales. Our collaboration indicates that high spatial and temporal variability in precipitation patterns and river levels may complicate climate change and sustainability analyses. However, combining results from participatory research with novel methods for climate analysis helps identify a 4-day trend in precipitation that may impact agroecosystem management. Indigenous participation in systematic data collection and interpretation of results is essential for distinguishing between socio-economic and climate forcings and evaluating climate impacts. Continued efforts to bridge Indigenous and Western knowledge systems are vital for sustainable environmental management in Indigenous territories and other regions where traditional management may be challenged in the context of global climate change.","WOS","SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE",NA

As numerous energy conversion and storage devices with various features have been developed, determining their types and capacity size and optimizing the synergic action of all selected energy devices under load uncertainty have become challenging issues during the planning and designing of a new IES. To address these issues, a load uncertainty model is constructed by integrating the regional equivalent standard building-integrated load prediction method, the robust uncertainty set method and the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. Based on this uncertainty model, this paper proposes a planning method that incorporates the fuzzy multi-objective decision and two-stage adaptive robust optimization methods for handling these challenging issues. The multi-objective decision method enables comprehensive optimization based on the system's economic performance, carbon emissions and grid integration level. The two-stage adaptive robust optimization method aims to optimize the single-objective problem transformed by the multi-objective decision method. The planning method is implemented in an industrial park in the Baoding City of China. The influence of load budget uncertainty, annual load growth rate and energy purchase price is then investigated. The results show that the load budget uncertainty and annual load growth rate only affect the optimal capacity size of the selected devices, whereas the energy purchase price influences both the optimal device types and their capacity size. The optimal capacity size remains constant when the load budget uncertainty exceeds 3. This study provides a methodology to select the suitable device types and determine their capacity size for IES under load uncertainty, which will benefit the design of a new IES.

To save energy and ensure the economic benefits of industrial production, we designed a reallocation planning model for urban industrial land. The planning model takes the cost of industrial land development, the investment intensity of unit land fixed assets and planning density as the main planning indices and combines the tax differences for different energy consumption intensity industries and the heterogeneity of the enterprise's decision of spatial location. The reallocation strategy of the model is simulated according to the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomerations of China. The characteristics of industrial land reallocation planning and its impact on industrial structure optimization and emission reduction are analyzed. The results show that the position adjustment of industrial parks during planning will lead to ladder-type spatial characteristics of planning indices through enterprisesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ decision heterogeneity.

The results indicate that regional carbon quotas remain similar under equality and grandfathering principles, except for regions with a high population projection, i.e., Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, or regions with a high level of current emissions, such as North America.

Moreover, carbon emissions reduced by carbon capture and storage applications are found to peak around 2050. In general, the share of fossil fuels in primary energy is larger under the larger carbon quota, which will also increase carbon capture and storage applications in fossil fuels. The average global investment needs for mitigating climate change are the lowest under the cost-effectiveness principle, and the marginal abatement cost is the same for all regions. For each region, as the carbon quota decreases the marginal abatement cost increases, while the energy investment changes independently from the carbon quota.

For these traditional strategies, either energy demands or state of storage tank is considered for the operation of system. This paper proposes a novel thermal storage strategy (TSS2) for CCHP systems, which determines the operational state of the PGU based upon electric demand, thermal demand and the state of thermal storage device. In this paper, the operation principle of TSS2 is described and compared with the traditional strategies. A hospital in Shanghai was used to evaluate and compared the performance of the system operating under different storage strategies. The results show that TSS2 improves the performance of CCHP system more significantly compared with the traditional strategies. TSS2 can make both PGU and capacity of thermal storage tank be fully used by CCHP system to produce more electric and thermal energy to meet demands of building. Compared with system without thermal storage, the minimum and maximum increase rates of annual total cost saving for traditional strategies are 0% and 14.84%, respectively. However, for TSS2, they can reach 3.79% and 20.22%. Similar conclusions could be achieved for CO2 emission reduction and primary energy saving.

An under-ice survey of 29 lakes, three open-water surveys of 43 lakes, and weekly surveys of 6 lakes revealed that CH4 among lake-waters ranged from very high concentrations at the end of winter, with highest concentrations linked to shortest annual river connection times, to considerably lower concentrations as open water progressed, with a limited concentration range among lakes by late summer. Lakes most strongly affected by thermokarst varied irregularly from this pattern and did not have the highest CH4 concentrations. CH4 among lake waters was generally related to measures of carbon substrate quantity, where relations with macrophyte biomass and dissolved organic carbon in lake water were statistically stronger than % organic matter within the lake sediments. CH4 was also directly related to the molecular weight (a[250]:a[365]) of dissolved organic matter at the end of winter, but was inversely related to this measure during open water. Carbon quality per se, after accounting for differences in carbon quantity (macrophyte biomass, dissolved organic carbon concentrations, or organic content of lake sediments), appears to play a significant role in controlling CH4 concentrations among the lake waters, particularly during winter ice cover. Carbon quality in lake sediments and of dissolved organic matter in winter lake waters appears to be as important as thermokarst augmentation of carbon quantity for enhancing methanogenesis in this lake-rich Arctic system.","WOS","JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES",NA

At the regional level, we study the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the influencing factors through Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regress (GTWR). The main results are as follows. (1) At the national level, the positive contribution of the energy mix is the largest. The energy intensity of the production sector is the main negative driving factor in the early stage, and in the later stage, the principal negative contribution comes from the combined action of the CO2 emission coefficient and economic structure.

According to the International Energy Agency, these emissions have to be reduced by more than 70% by 2040 to stay on track for the 1.5-2 Ã‚Â°C scenario suggested by the Paris Agreement. To ensure a socially fair transition towards the phase-out of coal, the European Commission introduced the Coal Regions in Transition initiative in late 2017. The present paper analyses to what extent the use of photovoltaic electricity generation systems can help with this transition in the coal regions of the European Union (EU). A spatially explicit methodology was developed to assess the solar photovoltaic (PV) potential in selected regions where open-cast coal mines are planned to cease operation in the near future. Different types of solar PV systems were considered including ground-mounted systems developed either on mining land or its surroundings. Furthermore, the installation of rooftop solar PV systems on the existing building stock was also analysed. The obtained results show that the available area in those regions is abundant and that solar PV systems could fully substitute the current electricity generation of coal-fired power plants in the analysed regions.

Energy audit mandates, such as New York City (NYC)Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Local Law 87 (LL87), require energy consultants to analyze installed building systems and provide building stakeholders with cost effective ECM recommendations on a multi-year cycle. However, complete audits are costly and time consuming. To accelerate ECM implementation, policymakers are exploring ways to utilize available data to target ECMs across a city's entire building stock. In this study, energy audit data for over 1100 buildings in NYC, submitted in compliance with LL87, are analyzed to identify opportunities for ECMs across building system categories (e.g. distribution system, domestic hot water, etc.). A machine learning classifier, specifically a user-facing falling rule list (FRL) classifier based on binary features derived from LL87 data, is developed here to predict ECM eligibility given a specific set of building characteristics. Overall, the trained FRL classifier performs well (ROC AUC 0.72Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0.86) for predicting cooling system, distribution system, domestic hot water, fuel switching, lighting, and motors ECM opportunities, which represent a majority of the auditor-recommended ECMs in the sample. Additionally, linear decision lists developed by the model allow building stakeholders to easily conduct streamlined audits of building systems and identify possible ECM opportunities by limiting input to the most relevant factors and prioritizing likely retrofit candidates. The implications of this work are significant in accelerating the adoption of building ECMs and catalyzing energy use and GHG emissions reductions from buildings.

Water-Energy-Food Nexus is central for sustainable development and promoting efficient management of resources. Nevertheless, an efficient and sustainable Water-Energy-Food Nexus design requires the participation of multiple stakeholders in the decision-making process. This work presents a multi-objective optimization model for the design of a Water-Energy-Food system that involves the sustainable production of water, energy and food in areas that share economic activities through the industrial, agriculture and livestock sectors. Additionally, a multi-stakeholder assessment is presented to generate a set of solutions, where different priorities are given to the stakeholders. This approach allows quantifying the level of satisfaction of each of the stakeholders. Integration of resources is addressed according to economic and environmental objectives, such as the minimization of the cost of the system, water abstraction and greenhouse gas emissions. As case study, a region located in Mexico was selected based on its industrial activity and the challenges it currently faces in meeting resource demands due to low water availability. Results show that water reuse is crucial to improve the Water-Energy-Food Nexus sustainability. Also, it was found that the most affected sector for water scarcity is the agricultural sector. This model can be the basis for planning the Water-Energy-Food Nexus at regional level involving different stakeholders and for determining sustainable interactions between resources.

If comprehensive low-carbon development of cities is to be possible, transportation, as a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, is a particularly important sector to address. Major changes to transport behaviour and systems will be required in order to secure a shift to sustainable modes of transport and removal of infrastructure that reinforces unsustainable patterns of transportation. This paper examines the links between low-carbon urban development and sustainable mobility, with reference to the case of Odense, Denmark. With a reputation as a city of cyclists, Odense has recently closed a highway that divided central districts of the city, and is constructing a new tramway in its place. Results from a qualitative study, including interviews with individuals active in local policy processes, provide insights into Odense's experiences and inform analysis of the influences on municipal strategies and plans for sustainable mobility, questioning if climate change need be the primary focus when designing policies to enable low-carbon urban development.

What unites these examples is that they all represent framework legislation that aims to facilitate climate change mitigation by creating continuous policy processes whereby mechanisms for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are developed and implemented. This article is concerned with the extent to which they are living policy processes or rather symbolic gestures. We analyse seven European CCAs with regard to GHG emission reduction targets, planning/implementation mechanisms, and feedback/evaluations prescribed by the laws. These three features correspond with three aspects of climate policy integration (CPI): interpretations of CPI as a norm; CPI as a process of governing; CPI as a policy outcome. We show that CCAs address all three aspects of CPI and constitute living policy processes, although to varying extents. However, CCAs are also policy processes in that they are part of a political system, affected by political forces external to the legislation, positively and negatively. Key policy insights CCAs can provide a normative basis for policymaking on climate change at the national level, especially through quantitative emission reduction targets. Whilst CCAs can bring some stability and predictability to policymaking on climate change (mainly because legislation is more difficult to amend or remove than policy strategies), they are still vulnerable to political developments. Most CCAs lack either short/medium-term (Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Sweden) or long-term (Austria) targets. Given EU Member StatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ aim to decarbonise in the next three decades and the Paris Agreement's global goal of pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5Ã‚Â°C, states need to find ways to guide this process. One approach could be the inclusion of short-term, medium-term and long-term targets in their CCAs. Since sanctioning mechanisms are lacking across all the CCAs analysed here, it is not clear what will happen if legally binding targets are not met. Just as it is difficult to imagine speed limits and speed cameras without accompanying penalties, it is hard to imagine how CCAs without sanctions can deliver decarbonization.

Most commercial and office buildings install conventional air-conditioning (AC) at individual premises for space conditioning. AC constitutes an average high of 58% of the total energy consumption in a building. In the meantime, the amount of municipal solid waste produced is also proliferating. KL as a city with compact population and limited land mass for waste disposal, the implementation of a large-scale centralised district cooling system (DCS) fuelled with biogas energy seems to be more sustainable. This study aims to assess the performance of various possible cooling system schemes in providing cooling service to office buildings in tropical urban, including the existing AC system and the newly proposed DCS technology integrated with biogas energy. Three parameters which are energy consumption, greenhouse gas emission and economic viability are analysed on a yearly basis. With a total cooling load of 4008 kW to be supplied to five similar buildings in KL, seven case scenarios involving different cooling schemes of AC and DCS are studied and compared. The result determines that biogas-fuelled cooling systems are as attractive as the grid-electrified systems. Currently, AC unit operating with on-site biogas-generated electricity is the most desirable cooling scheme for KL city, with an annual worth of MYR - 1.004 M/y and greenhouse gas avoidance of 41.1 kt CO2 eq./y. DCS may not be a preferred option yet due to its high investment and operation costs. A sensitivity analysis conducted shows that there is a need to increase the current electricity tariff (up to at least MYR 1.49 -1.56/kWh) in order to make DCS more economically attractive as the conventional AC units.

However, previous studies using computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have analyzed climate policies without considering company size. This may have led to inaccurate results because the impacts of climate policy would differ depending on the coverage of regulated companies. Accordingly, this study examines the environmental and economic impacts of greenhouse gas emission reduction policies, assuming policy results vary by firm size, as covered by the Korean emission trading system. To this end, a CGE model with a separate social accounting matrix based on company size is used to compare three scenarios that reflect different types of carbon pricing methods. The results show that greenhouse gases will be reduced to a lower extent and utility will decrease more if mitigation policies are only imposed to large companies. Key policy insights Carbon pricing policies should consider the different impacts on companies of different sizes and industry sectors. Without considering the different sizes of companies covered by an ETS, the expected carbon price and its economic impact will be underestimated. Small and medium-sized companies will face more negative impacts than large companies in some industry sectors under an ETS, even if the mitigation burden is only faced by large companies.

The empirical results indicate that the relationship between urbanization and CO2 emissions follows a U-shaped curve in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), an N-shaped curve in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and an inverted N-shaped pattern in the Pearl River Delta (PRD). Additionally, innovation shows a significantly positive effect on reducing CO2 emissions in the YRD, but does not exert a significantly direct effect on CO2 emissions in the BTH and the PRD. More importantly, innovation played an important moderating role between urbanization and CO2 emissions in the YRD and PRD, suggesting that reducing the positive impacts of urbanization on CO2 emissions depends on innovative development.

They play a vital role in the global carbon cycle by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, there has been a large reduction in the global BC ecosystems due to their conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, overexploitation, and removal for human settlements. Effectively monitoring BC ecosystems at large scales remains a challenge owing to practical difficulties in monitoring and the time-consuming field measurement approaches used. As a result, sensible policies and actions for the sustainability and conservation of BC ecosystems can be hard to implement. In this context, remote sensing provides a useful tool for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems faster and at larger scales. Numerous studies have been carried out on various sensors based on optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), aerial photographs (APs), and multispectral data. Remote sensing-based approaches have been proven effective for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems by a large number of studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on the applications of remote sensing techniques for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. The main goal of this review is to provide an overview and summary of the key studies undertaken from 2010 onwards on remote sensing applications for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. Our review showed that optical imagery, such as multispectral and hyper-spectral data, is the most common for mapping BC ecosystems, while the Landsat time-series are the most widely-used data for monitoring their changes on larger scales. We investigate the limitations of current studies and suggest several key aspects for future applications of remote sensing combined with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for mapping coastal vegetation and monitoring their extents and changes.","WOS","SENSORS",NA

The geological storage of CO2 is one technique gaining interest, and the offshore Bohai Basin is believed to be a promising option to aid emissions mitigation. The Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, which measure more than 10,000 m in thickness and have diverse depositional systems and good reservoirseal assemblages, appear to offer the most favorable circumstance for CO2 storage in the offshore Bohai Basin. The Minghuazhen Formation of the Pliocene- Miocene consists of thick and extensive mudstone, especially its lower member, and is regarded as an excellent regional seal cover. The Miocene sandstone, including the lower member of the Minghuazhen Formation and the Guantao Formation, has high porosity and permeability and is a preferred target storage reservoir. The Dongying Formation and the Shahejie Formation of the Oligocene-Eocene are also storage options. Based on the pore volume method suggested by the U.S. Department of Energy, we calculated the effective storage capacity of the Cenozoic sedimentary rocks in the offshore Bohai Basin. The mean storage capacity is approximately 192 Gt, representing a huge capacity on a par with that of the Pearl River Mouth Basin, and potentially offering storage capacity for hundreds of years of CO2 emissions from the Circum-Bohai-Sea region. Considering the storage capacity and risk, the Bozhong Sag area may offer the most promising early CO2 storage option in the basin. Ã‚Â© 2016 Geological Society of America.

For a loss-and-damage plan to work, it must be capable of carrying the load, the load being whatever minimal standards that morality and political consensus require. But if residual risk climbs too high, it will fall short of even the most basic expectations. The Paris Agreement calls for holding the rise in global average temperature to 'well below 2Ã‚Â°C above pre-industrial levels', while working to limit the increase to 1.5Ã‚Â°C. How much difference is in that half-degree? From the point of view of residual risk, quite a lot.

Exploring the impacts of carbon pricing in the university setting","Lee S., Lee S.","Abstract Climate Change is one of the most important threats in the world today and it is driven by the human-induced build-up of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. Despite worldwide policy efforts from the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement, global emissions of GHG have continued to steadily increase over the past decade. Against this backdrop, many higher education institutions (HEIs) around the world began to engage in sustainable practices implementing green initiatives on their campuses. Using the waste disposal and the associated GHG emissions data from the academic community, this study describes how HEIs can assume a leadership role in climate mitigation through the implementation of a carbon pricing initiative. Specifically, this study estimates the economic costs of carbon emissions from waste and conceptualizes how revenues generated from carbon pricing can be rechanneled to support carbon reduction efforts in HEIs. By this approach, HEIs not only create incentives for campus users such as students and employees to choose cleaner options but also be able to understand their own carbon footprint and adjust strategy accordingly. While carbon pricing has long been regarded as an alternative approach to tackle carbon pollution, it has not been much discussed in the area of waste management. In this regard, this study attempted to fill this research gap by finding emission reduction potentials in waste management using carbon pricing as a mechanism.

Its carbon emissions, which result from the long heating period and considerable consumption of coal in residential buildings during operation, must be reduced.

On the basis of these predictions, the contributions of heating, cooling, cooking, illumination, washing, and other activities to carbon emissions were analyzed. The influencing factors in the reduction of carbon emissions from residential buildings in a cold region were identified. The results showed that energy-saving-low-carbon was the optimal scenario to reduce carbon emissions. Meanwhile, carbon emissions will peak in 2030, with a value of 42.06 Mt under the same scenario.

A review at Bogor City government's development plans reveals that a range of activities has been incorporated to reduce the City's Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions and these activities have also targeted major and increasing emission sources based on their emissions profile. We identified relevant activities indicated in Medium-Term City Development Plan (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Daerah - RPJMD) and Medium-Term Sectoral Strategic Plans (Rencana Strategis - RENSTRA) for the periods of 2014-2019. We examined the emission profile and similar to other cities worldwide, energy was revealed as the largest source of emission in Bogor. Emissions from energy sector accounted for 99% of the total city emission and 36% of it come from transportation. We also examined the annual trends. In 2016, Bogor City had a population of 1,064,687, a 10% increase from year 2010. The increase was similar to their GHG emissions which showed a 13% increase in 2016 compared to the 2010' level. The growth between these two parameters, however, was not similar. While Bogor City's population showed a positive trend, despite at smaller rate than in previous years, emissions level in 2016 was actually less than the 2015 level. This significant emission reduction within a year might not merely be the results of mitigation action, but other factor such as economic condition. Review on Bogor City government's Development Plan for the period of 2014-2019 showed six groups of mitigation programmes were being implemented. Some of the activities within the programmes were progressing well while others were having set back. Consultation with relevant agency's officers revealed some operational constraints to the implementation of the mitigation activities. Bogor City has developed a Bus Rapid Transportation (BRT) system called Trans Pakuan and has improved pedestrian area to reduce individual vehicle trips. Despite enthusiasm from City Government through these programmes, the increasing trend of e-hail apps transportation was potentially constraining as their ability to cater door-to-door trip is preferable for users than using bus or walking. In the waste sector, lack of segregating habit in households contributed to problems in 3R (reduce, reuse, & recycle) stations. These findings indicate that development of mitigation options needs a comprehensive approach, including consideration of people's habit and acceptance of the options.

Our research focuses on the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area considering two CDM landfill projects: Bandeirantes, a public project and Caieiras, a private project. Indicators are proposed to evaluate the social and environmental outcomes that can be generated from CDM landfills, organized into five themes: participation, stakeholder interaction, benefits, environmental quality monitoring and gas emissions monitoring. Data, collected by applying indicators, are organized and analyzed based on two complementary theoretical frameworks: The characteristics-based model and the public-private innovation networks in services (ServPPIN) concept. The results highlights a gap in the access to CDM projects and the participation of stakeholders, and benefits related to the CDM projects implementation, corroborating to the relevance of the development of indicators based on interdisciplinary and multi-agent approaches which take into account the different stakeholders.","WOS","JOURNAL OF INNOVATION ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT",NA

The United States has responded by including managed coastal wetlands for the first time in its 2017 GHG Inventory report along with an updated time series in the most recent 2018 submission and plans to update the time series on an annual basis as part of its yearly submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The United States followed IPCC Good Practice Guidance when reporting sources and sinks associated with managed coastal wetlands. Here we show that intact vegetated coastal wetlands are a net sink for GHGs. Despite robust regulation that has protected substantial stocks of carbon, the United States continues to lose coastal wetlands to development and the largest loss of wetlands to open water occurs around the Mississippi Delta due mostly to upstream changes in hydrology and sediment delivery, and oil and gas extraction. These processes create GHG emissions. By applying comprehensive Inventory reporting, scientists in the United States have identified opportunities for reducing GHG emissions through restoration of coastal wetlands that also provide many important societal co-benefits.

Therefore, as carbon abatement is a public good, coping with climate change is also a public-good; however, it suffers from many free-rider incentives, leading to a tragedy of the commons. Overcoming this challenge from a systemic perspective, requires that all sectors such as industry, government, and citizens on global, national, and regional levels engage in low-carbon development and the implementation of fair and efficient climate policies. Through a theoretical exploration of carbon abatement and a systemic description of low-carbon systems, this paper developed a cybernetic framework for coping with climate change, which consists of a cloud platform for data analysis, meta-synthetic engineering for decision support, a polycentric approach to extensive consultation and various functional goal achievement modules. On this basis, by combining the Ã¢â‚¬Å“invisible handÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“visible handÃ¢â‚¬Â and by integrating negotiation at the global level, cooperation at the national level and knowledge at the local level, a multilevel policymaking model is proposed to address complex climate change problems. This cybernetic paradigm based innovative approach could provide valuable illumination to stakeholders seeking to cope with climate change.
