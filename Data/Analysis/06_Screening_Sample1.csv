We have developed and tested the MOSAICA-f framework to build innovative multi-functional agricultural landscapes that can consider explicitly: 1) the performance of cropping systems at the field scale, 2) farmers' decision processes on the adoption of cropping systems, and 3) possible scenarios for innovations and policy changes at the regional scale. This framework is based on a scenario approach that encompasses normative, exploratory and optimized scenarios to assess the relevance of combinations of new agricultural policies, changes to the external context (market and regulations) and innovations in cropping systems. The impacts of these changes on sustainability issues are simulated using the regional bioeconomic model MOSAICA for farmers' decision processes regarding the adoption of cropping systems at the field scale throughout a region. Applied in Guadeloupe (French West Indies), the MOSAICA-f framework enabled the design of a scenario increasing agricultural added value, food and energy self-sufficiency, employment and the quality of water bodies and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This sustainable scenario combines new cropping systems tuned to farm types with a reorientation of subsidies, an increased workforce and banning food crop production on polluted soils. It can be used to understand the potential contribution of agriculture to sustainability issues and to help local decision makers define policies that will account for the spatial diversities of farms and fields in a landscape. Beyond the design of such a win-win scenario, MOSAICA-f has revealed trade-offs in the provision of services by agriculture.

This article presents a brief history of the issue, and reviews related Paris outcomes, focusing on the issues of compensation and liability, governance, financial support, insurance and displacement. It concludes that despite paragraph 51 of Decision 1/CP.21 adopting the Paris Agreement, all options remain open for the development of a system under the climate regime that can address the underlying concerns raised by small island developing States and others in calling for a system of compensation and liability. In the context of the 1.5 degrees C temperature limit and increasing climate impacts, this article also highlights the need for the Warsaw International Mechanism to play an active role in quantifying the scale of loss and damage that is projected from human-induced climate change in different regions and in different national contexts, over different time frames and at different emission pathways, and in sharing developments in attribution science, to help in the design of approaches to address loss and damage that are suited to assisting the most vulnerable developing country parties and to underscore the need for urgent emission reductions.","WOS","REVIEW OF EUROPEAN COMPARATIVE & INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW",NA

Yet making agricultural regions locally carbon neutral will involve an economic cost, with existing patterns of greenhouse gas emissions and spatial costs of abatement affecting that cost of achieving regional carbon neutrality. This study examines the economic cost of locally achieving carbon neutrality, using the illustration of Western AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s agricultural region. The cost to the region of achieving carbon neutrality via reforestation is estimated, as is the spatial allocation of farmland for sequestration. Social and political pressures that likely constrain how much farmland can be reforested are explicitly considered. Findings are subject to a sensitivity analysis and several caveats. The annual cost of regional carbon neutrality via proscribed regional reforestation, under current carbon offset prices, is estimated to range from AUD216Ã‚Â million to AUD250 million (i.e. under 3 per cent of the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gross value of agricultural production) which might suggest the challenge to be carbon neutral is within commercial reach. However, without other financial incentives, it likely involves farm business profits being reduced by around 15 per cent.

It addresses the strategic framing of airports planning, including the role of National Policy Statements, and the nature of the consideration of the planning applications for consent to develop. Temporal and geographical dimensions are analysed, showing how central to the UK state project is the expansion of the southern English/ Greater London core, with associated infrastructure geographies. It concludes that corporate and state power may well achieve the desired expansion of airport capacity in the London region, overriding environmental and other non-commercial considerations. However, there are tensions in the dominant state and business model, given an apparent commitment to carbon emissions reduction and other air quality goals, as well as to minimising the costs to the public sector which airport expansion is likely to generate.

Currently, most allocation methods mainly focus on the realization of a single performance goal, which will result in conflicts between different levels of participants. To overcome this limitation, a bi-objective programming model (BPM) with two sub-objective functions of abatement costs and carbon assets is proposed. Meanwhile, cost-oriented model (CM) and asset-oriented model (AM) are implemented as comparison approaches that represent the minimization of regional abatement costs and the maximization of individual interests, respectively. The empirical results of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region reveal that BPM is the most efficient and feasible approach to some extent. More precisely, BPM can motivate the enthusiasm of all participants while optimizing abatement costs. With the increase of regional total quotas, the advantage of BPM becomes more and more prominent. The contribution of this paper is to present a novel method for carbon emission quota allocation, which fills the gap in the existing literature. Furthermore, the proposed method that can be deployed in other similar regions assists policymakers in enacting an effective emission reduction policy and in better understanding the objectives of economy, energy and environment.

As a consequence, its manufacture and use imparts global durability and environmental consequences. The manufacture of conventional ordinary Portland cement (OPC), the main constituent in concrete, for example, alone accounts for 5-8% of global CO2 emissions worldwide. In addition, the main durability challenges of OPC are associated with the chemistry of its binder. In recent years, increased demand for sustainable building materials with lower CO2 emissions and equivalent (or higher) service lifespans have prompted the development of alternative and novel cementitious materials to supplement and/or in some applications replace the use of OPC concrete in a variety of building and infrastructure engineering projects. Many of these alternative and novel cementitious material systems and approaches generally demonstrate lower CO2 emissions during production (up to 50% CO2 reductions) and increased durability when subjected to harsh conditions (e.g., lower shrinkage, higher acid resistance) when compared to OPC. This paper synthesizes and presents the general classification, characteristics, and current applications of four promising alternative cementitious material systems, namely (1) high-aluminate, (2) super-sulfated slag, (3) alkali-activated, and (4) carbonate-based cements (e.g., bio-cements). We will highlight the basics of alternative cement chemistries, their environmental impacts, and relevant material properties (i.e., fresh- A nd hardened-state properties) compared to OPC concrete. The discussions presented herein are supplemented with specific case-study examples of real-world applications and aim to serve as an inspiring platform for researchers, educators, and engineering professionals to conceptualize how next-generation cementitious materials can (and will) shape our built environment.

While this was an important step for the global community, much work remains to be done. Based on climate change and technology scenarios developed by the International Energy Agency in the wake of the agreement, the World Bank has developed a set of projections about the amount and kind of feedstock materials that will be required to achieve these targets in the years ahead. So-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“technology mineralsÃ¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â‚¬â€including metals like lithium and cobalt that are commonly found in rechargeable batteries, or tellurium that is used to make solar cellsÃ¢â‚¬â€figure prominently. An important aspect of the Paris Agreement is the need for the world economy to shift away from fossil fuels towards green energy networks based on stored electricity and renewable energy sources. But achieving the agreement's ambitious goals will necessarily require dramatic increases in global production rates for technology minerals that are far beyond current levels. Despite the urgent need for these feedstock materials, however, the mineral supply sector is not on track to satisfy anywhere near this demand. To put the industry and its supporting institutions on a path more likely to deliver these vital materials, this paper recommends a more integrated, global, system-wide approach to managing the organizations behind technology minerals: the Smart Mineral Enterprise Development (SMED) framework.

Particularly, the building sector plays a fundamental role in driving urban energy consumption and GHG emission reduction. Improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings has a great potential, however selecting among the multiple available retrofit solutions may result difficult for a decision maker. This work is an application of the PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation) method in order to provide a guideline for ranking different alternatives of building retrofitting at the building and district level. To this end, the case study of Turin has been selected for outranking five different retrofit alternatives. First, the retrofit alternatives were applied to a district and second, the same procedure was tested at the building level.

It follows the EU initiative for implementing at least 100 PED in Europe by 2025. Four urban typologies have been assessed using the bottom-up energy modelling tool MAPED that enables a simplified energy demand- supply analysis at the district scale. Considering relevant urban typologies in different construction periods, the analysis focused on converting the allocated building stocks into PED by employing comprehensive thermal refurbishment and energy efficiency measures, electrification of end-uses and fuel switching, exploitation of local renewable energy potential, and flexible interaction with the regional energy system. The results reveal that a detached housing district can achieve a positive annual energy balance (for heat and power) of 110% due to the fact that there are sufficient surfaces (roofs, facades, open land) available for the production of local renewable energy, whereas the remaining typologies fail to achieve the criteria with an annual balance ranking between 61% and 97%, showing additional margins for improvement to meet the PED conditions. The presented concept offers a practical approach to investigate the PED suitability of urban typologies. It will help the Austrian Ministry for Climate Action and Environment to identify appropriate strategies for the refurbishment of existing urban areas towards the PED standard.

However, this has led to a contradictory situation where both high carbon emission and reduction exist together. The average economic growth of Inner Mongolia reached 15.76% between 2006 and 2016, which caused huge CO2 emissions. However, promotion of the renewable energy policy (since 2005) resulted in an energy self-sufficiency rate that reached 270.80% by 2016. In this study of the Inner Mongolia carbon emission situation, the logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) model was used to analyze the factors affecting carbon emission fluctuations from 2005 to 2016. The decoupling elasticity index was then used to measure the decoupling effect of the economic growth and carbon emissions. The results of this research show that: firstly, CO2 emissions increased rapidly from 651.03 million tons in 2006 to 1723.24 million tons in 2013. Despite a slight decline in CO2 emissions, a level above 1600 million tons was maintained between 2014 and 2016. Secondly, the industry sector was the main source of CO2 emissions in Inner Mongolia, and coal-based fuel played a determining role. Thirdly, in this study, two important contributions were made, including the discovery of two new drivers: labor and emission intensity factors. Further, findings about the effect of the six industrial sectors, economic structure, energy density, and emission intensity factors were also decomposed. It was found that during research period, the population factor, labor factor, and labor productivity factor all had a positive influence on CO2 emissions, whereas the economic structure factor and emission intensity factor had different impacts on the CO2 emissions depending on the particular industrial sector. Furthermore, the energy intensity of six industrial sectors contributed to the decrease in aggregate CO2 emissions. Finally, in this study, it was also found that economic growth and CO2 growth in Inner Mongolia presented a weak decoupling state. Policy recommendations based on these results have been presented.","WOS","SUSTAINABILITY",NA

When the per capita GDP is greater than the threshold value (RMB 37,410), the expansion of the financial scale will also increase carbon intensity, but the potency of this effect will be weaker.

Here we investigate low and zero carbon pathways based on clean electricity and sector coupling. Effects from different spatialities are considered through city and national cases (Helsinki and Finland). The methodology employs techno-economic energy system optimization, including resilience aspects. In the Finnish case, wind, nuclear, and biomass coupled to power-to-heat and other flexibility measures could provide a cost-effective carbon-neutral pathway (annual costs -18%), but nuclear and wind are, to some extent, exclusionary. A (near) carbon-neutral energy system seems possible even without nuclear (-94% CO 2 ). Zero-carbon energy production benefits from a stronger link to the broader electricity market albeit flexibility measures. On the city level, wind would not easily replace local combined heat and power (CHP), but may increase electricity export. In the Helsinki case, a business-as-usual approach could halve emissions and annual costs, while in a comprehensive zero-emission approach, the operating costs (OPEX) could decrease by 87%. Generally, electrification of heat production could be effective to reduce CO 2 . Low or zero carbon solutions have a positive impact on resilience, but in the heating sector this is more problematic, e.g., power outage and adequacy of supply during peak demand will require more attention when planning future carbon-free energy systems.

The existing studies have usually introduced a single indicator to describe urbanization and have ignored the complexity and multi-dimensionality of urbanization. This study establishes an evaluation system of urbanization quality to estimate the urbanization development level. The geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is employed to examine the impact of the urbanization quality on CO2 emissions and reveals the spatial differences of 30 provinces in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The results show that there are significant temporal and spatial differences in the effects of the urbanization quality on CO2 emissions between provinces. Improvements in the urbanization quality have contributed to cutting CO2 emissions in most provinces. The impact of the urbanization quality on CO2 emissions in the central region and western region is greater than that in the eastern region. The energy intensity has the largest positive impact on CO2 emissions, which indicates that technical progress can effectively reduce CO2 emissions. The industrial structure has a positive impact on CO2 emissions in 2000 and 2015, whereas it has a negative impact on the CO2 emissions of some provinces in 2005 and 2010.

The HKT is simulated together with photovoltaic (PV), diesel generator (DG), and battery (B) power using the well-known Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Electric Renewables software to optimize the HRES. The net present cost (NPC) of the optimum HRES is $12.7 million with minimal cost of energy of $0.158/kWh. The optimum system is capable of saving approximately $9.7 million during the project lifetime (25 years) in the form of NPC as compared to the diesel generator system. In addition, the system is capable of saving 28.971 x 10(6) l of fuel at the cost of $5.11 million during the project lifetime. Finally, it is concluded that the hybrid PV/HKT/DG/B is the more economic and environment friendly system as compared to other system configurations especially the diesel generator system, because it is able to reduce 76.29 x 10(6) kg of the amount of CO2 emissions during the project lifetime.

The initial constraint vector pre-processing step updates the initial state vector prior to the retrievals if the algorithm detects that the initial state vector is far from the true state vector in extreme cases where there are CO2 emissions. The MDNM uses the Levenberg-Marquardt parameter <U+03B3>, which ensures a positive Hessian matrix, and a scale factor a, which adjusts the step size to optimize the stability of the convergence. While the algorithm iteratively searches for an optimized solution using observed spectral radiances, MDNM adjusts parameters <U+03B3> and a to achieve stable convergence. We present simulated retrieval samples to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and comparing it to existing methods. The standard deviation of our retrievals adding random noise was less than 3.8 ppmv. After pre-processing the initial estimate when it was far from the true value, the CO2 retrieval errors in the boundary layers were within 1.2 ppmv. We tested the MDNM algorithmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s performance using GOSAT L1b data with cloud screening. Our preliminary validations comparing the results to TCCON FTS measurements showed that the average bias was less than 1.8 ppm and the correlation coefficient was approximately 0.88, which was larger than for the GOSAT L2 product.

There are many options for the upgrading and alteration of the equipment which demand a large initial investment. Usually, the initial cost is a barrier to implementing the plan. In this study, sustainability, performance, and cost savings are improved without any equipment change. Exergy assessment along with TRNSYS modeling and simulation are the tools applied in this study. The focus is on the operation time of the equipment. By adjusting the operation time of the equipment with the highest exergy destruction, in the district cooling in the University of Idaho, Moscow campus in the United States of America (USA) all three goals without any equipment change has been achieved. The operation hours of cold thermal energy storage (TES), cooling towers, and chillers are altered by removing the low efficiency operation time. As results electricity consumption is reduced to 38%, which is beneficial in terms of sustainability, as it eliminates 428,800 kg CO2 emissions in electricity generation and provides an annual cost saving of $140,000. Ultimately, modification of the equipment operation in district cooling is a key to improvement of sustainability and cost saving. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","WOS","ENERGY",NA

It is intended to play a central role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to both jurisdictionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 2030 limits on economy-wide emissions, but the programme features a growing bank of surplus compliance instruments (allowances and carbon offsets) that could put participating governmentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ climate targets at risk. To aid in understanding the range of possible outcomes, we built WCI-RULES, an open-source model that simulates the WCI programmeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supply-demand balance through to 2030. By using the latest historical data and representing all relevant programme regulations in computer code, WCI-RULES accurately depicts the supply side of the WCI programme and allows users to explore programme outcomes across a range of future demand-side scenarios. Model users can specify three demand-side inputs that have the largest effect on projections of the programmeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supply-demand balance: future trends in emissions covered by the programme, allowance auction outcomes, and regulated partiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ use of carbon offset credits. The model simulates neither allowance prices nor price-induced mitigation, but is interoperable with other analyses that do, and can therefore serve as a basis for inter-model comparison with other studies. We find that oversupply conditions persist across a wide range of scenarios, including one that matches the assumptions of CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s official 2030 climate strategy. If unaddressed, these conditions could frustrate participating governmentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ability to reach their economy-wide 2030 climate targets. Key policy insights WCI programme caps have exceeded regulated emissions since the programmeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inception, creating an oversupply that could jeopardize the programmeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to achieve its expected emission reductions. Using a new open-source model, WCI-RULES, we show that oversupply conditions persist across a range of modelled emission scenarios through to 2030, so that emissions could significantly exceed programme caps in the mid-to-late 2020s. If regulated emissions exceed programme caps in the mid-to-late 2020s, it will be difficult for California and QuÃƒÂ©bec to reduce their economy-wide emissions below statutory limits. WCI-RULES can be extended in future work to simulate the effects of potential regulatory reforms as well as any new entrants to the WCI programme.

Transport emissions are a major source of carbon emissions, and cities grapple with reducing carbon emissions, and improving the air quality for their citizens. London's new transport strategy document, called Mayor's Transport Strategy 2018, aims to achieve a zero-carbon city by 2050 and set out many actions to facilitate this transition. However, London needs a prioritisation framework which would take into account the financial, environmental and social impacts of these actions. Considering the uncertainties around these actions, which has been now significantly more crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study proposes a novel extension of Best-Worst Method (BWM) and extension of the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Iterative Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)) method using D numbers. This TODIM-D based fuzzy MCDM approach provides a prioritisation framework for the actions associated with zero-carbon city policies set out in London's strategy document. According to the results of the proposed method, Ã¢â‚¬Å“introducing zero-emission zonesÃ¢â‚¬Â should be selected as the first initiative to implement. The prioritization of this initiative allows London to achieve a zero-carbon transport by having the greatest impact on the modal shift from cars to sustainable mobility modes with a lower operational and implementation cost as well as having greater public support.

The implemented monitoring system allows a detailed analysis of the energy consumption and production of each building within the project. Analysis of the electrical self-sufficient rate of the system regarding the influence of different weather conditions show that the self-consumption rate is approximately constant and independent of seasonal conditions or heat demand. The system achieved in total the CO2 savings of 36% with respect to the German electricity mix. With regard to the local electricity-specific emission factor of NRW, the 100 installed CHP systems can reduce the CO2 emissions by 40% compared to the substituted energy supply. Estimation of the CO2 mitigation potential related to the German residential sector by the combustion of fossil fuel cells showed that in 2015, the CO2 savings in the predetermined scenario amounts to 11%.

Mexico indicated in its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution and its Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy that the land sector will contribute to meeting GHG emission reduction goals. Since 2012, the Mexican government through its National Forestry Commission, with international financial and technical support, has been developing carbon dynamics models to explore climate change mitigation options in the forest sector. Following a systems approach, here we assess the biophysical mitigation potential of forest ecosystems, harvested wood products and their substitution benefits (i.e. the change in emissions resulting from substitution of wood for more emissions-intensive products and fossil fuels), for policy alternatives considered by the Mexican government, such as a net zero deforestation rate and sustainable forest management. We used available analytical frameworks (Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector and a harvested wood products model), parameterized with local input data in two contrasting Mexican states. Using information from the National Forest Monitoring System (e.g. forest inventories, remote sensing, disturbance data), we demonstrate that activities aimed at reaching a net-zero deforestation rate can yield significant CO2e mitigation benefits by 2030 and 2050 relative to a baseline scenario ('business as usual'), but if combined with increasing forest harvest to produce long-lived products and substitute more energy-intensive materials, emissions reductions could also provide other co-benefits (e.g. jobs, illegal logging reduction). We concluded that the relative impact of mitigation activities is locally dependent, suggesting that mitigation strategies should be designed and implemented at sub-national scales. We were also encouraged about the ability of the modeling framework to effectively use Mexico's data, and showed the need to include multiple sectors and types of collaborators (scientific and policy-maker communities) to design more comprehensive portfolios for climate change mitigation.

Ride-sharing is expected to substantially decrease CO2 emissions by raising vehicle occupancy, thus mechanically reducing the number of vehicles on the road. Yet, as ride-sharing entails both a decrease in travel (monetary) costs and in travel times (inasmuch as it reduces road congestion), it is likely to make the car more attractive ultimately. This could result in mode switching in the short run (as travelers forsake public transport or active modes for car), as well as in longer distances travelled in the medium run. In the long run, people could even take advantage of the easier travel conditions to relocate further within the metropolitan area. To account for these rebound effects, we develop an integrated land-use transport model. This intends to capture the effects of ride-sharing on the whole household decision process regarding transport and residential location. The model is applied to the Paris region, with several ride-sharing scenarios for year 2030. While ride-sharing does indeed strongly reduce CO2 emissions, we find substantial rebound mechanisms. In contrast to the (naÃƒÂ¯ve) expectation that raising vehicle occupancy by 50% would reduce CO2 emissions by 33%, the various rebound effects end up dividing the CO2 emission savings by a factor ranging from 2 to 3 depending on the day period considered (i.e. the morning or evening peak period). The rebound mechanisms - the mode switching, distance and relocation effects - should therefore be heeded. Some policy recommendations are provided to develop ride-sharing while curbing these unintended effects.

Evidence from Jiangsu Province, China","Wang J., Long R., Chen H., Li Q.","As the second largest energy user after the industrial sector, households are under enormous pressure to save energy and reduce emissions. Based on the particular perspective of gender-specific differences in energy use, we conducted a large-scale questionnaire survey among residents in Jiangsu, China, and investigated household daily energy use (DEU) and energy-efficient product purchases (EEPPs). We also measured the distribution of family decision-making power between husbands and wives using four dimensions: daily expenditure decisions (DEDs), large-scale commodity purchase decisions (LCPDs), children's education decisions, and elder support decisions, and we furthermore explored the influence of the conjugal power core on household energy conservation. The results showed that male-dominated families use more energy and were less likely to buy energy-efficient products than gender neutral families (0.814 times the DEU; 1.202 times the EEPPs) and female-dominated families (0.705 times the DEU; 1.325 times the EEPPs). Specifically, when women constituted the power core in respect to decision-making about daily household expenditure, the household's daily energy consumption was significantly lower, and this did not affect LCPDs; when women represented the power core of decision-making about the purchase large-scale commodities for the household, EEPPs and DEU both tended to go green. The endogeneity and robustness tests also confirmed that the results were reliable and stable. Our findings provide new ideas for the government, which can contribute to the formulation of more effective energy-saving and emission-reduction strategies.

Here we conduct a novel cross-sectoral assessment of regional carbon mitigation potential by running an ecosystem model with an explicit representation of forest structure and climate impacts for Bavaria, Germany, as a case study. We drive the model with four high-resolution climate projections (EURO-CORDEX) for the representative concentration pathway RCP4.5 and present-day land-cover from three satellite-derived datasets (CORINE, ESA-CCI, MODIS) and identify total mitigation potential by not only accounting for carbon storage but also material and energy substitution effects. The model represents the current state in Bavaria adequately, with a simulated forest biomass 12.9Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 0.4% lower than data from national forest inventories. Future land-use changes according to two ambitious land-use harmonization scenarios (SSP1xRCP2.6, SSP4xRCP3.4) achieve a mitigation of 206 and 247Ã‚Â Mt C (2015Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2100 period) via reforestation and the cultivation and burning of dedicated bioenergy crops, partly combined with carbon capture and storage. Sensitivity simulations suggest that converting croplands or pastures to bioenergy plantations could deliver a carbon mitigation of 40.9 and 37.7Ã‚Â kg C/m2, respectively, by the year 2100 if used to replace carbon-intensive energy systems and combined with CCS. However, under less optimistic assumptions (including no CCS), only 15.3 and 12.2Ã‚Â kg C/m2 are mitigated and reforestation might be the better option (20.0 and 16.8Ã‚Â kg C/m2). Mitigation potential in existing forests is limited (converting coniferous into mixed forests, nitrogen fertilization) or even negative (suspending wood harvest) due to decreased carbon storage in product pools and associated substitution effects. Our simulations provide guidelines to policy makers, farmers, foresters, and private forest owners for sustainable and climate-benefitting ecosystem management in temperate regions. They also emphasize the importance of the CCS technology which is regarded critically by many people, making its implementation in the short or medium term currently doubtable. Ã‚Â© 2020 The Authors.

By so doing, the increase observed in energy demand of buildings constitutes a major challenge to the protection of and reduction of greenhouse gases produced by buildings. This constitutes a critical element in the movement towards a more sustainable future. This study examines the indispensable relevance of carrying-out energy performance analysis on a building design blueprints prior to construction. The study employs the use of Autodesk Revit 2014 as a Building Information Modeling (BIM) tool and Autodesk Green Building Studio (GBS) for energy performance analysis of an existing student housing at Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo state, Nigeria in order to recommend energy efficient strategies that could be implemented at the design phase of the student housing. The energy-saving effects of the different building envelope were investigated and results were analyzed. The annual energy use revealed approximately 60 percent of electricity consumed from the national grid with the left-over 40 percent expelled on fuel. This result was, however, based on an assumption of a 20 hours minimum daily power supply from the national grid. The monthly heating load chart shows that heat is lost from the walls of the building. The walling material has a considerable impact on energy consumption. The simulation results of the existing student housing were compared with eight alternative designs that alter the building envelope and incorporate shading devices to reduce the carbon footprint and energy use. The best alternative design runs reduced the energy consumed yearly from 402, 168 kWh/year to 385, 318kWh/year.

As the largest urbanized megalopolis region in northern China, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji, JJJ) region (population: 112.7 million) is under considerable pressure to reduce carbon emissions. Despite the several emission inventories covering the JJJ region, a comprehensive evaluation of the CO2 emissions at the prefectural city scale in JJJ is still limited, and this information is crucial to implementing mitigation strategies. Results: Here, we collected and analyzed 8 published emission inventories to assess the emissions and uncertainty at the JJJ city level. The results showed that a large discrepancy existed in the JJJ emissions among downscaled country-level emission inventories, with total emissions ranging from 657 to 1132 Mt CO2 (or 849 Ã‚Â± 214 for mean Ã‚Â± standard deviation (SD)) in 2012, while emission estimates based on provincial-level data estimated emissions to be 1038 and 1056 Mt. Compared to the mean emissions of city-data-based inventories (989 Mt), provincial-data-based inventories were 6% higher, and national-data-based inventories were 14% lower. Emissions from national-data-based inventories were 53Ã¢â‚¬â€œ75% lower in the high-emitting industrial cities of Tangshan and Handan, while they were 47Ã¢â‚¬â€œ160% higher in Beijing and Tianjin than those from city-data-based inventories. Spatially, the emissions pattern was consistent with the distribution of urban areas, and urban emissions in Beijing contributed 50Ã¢â‚¬â€œ70% of the total emissions. Higher emissions from Beijing and Tianjin resulted in lower estimates of prefectural cities in Hebei for some national inventories. Conclusions: National-level data-based emission inventories produce large differences in JJJ prefectural city-level emission estimates. The city-level statistics data-based inventories produced more consistent estimates. The consistent spatial distribution patterns recognized by these inventories (such as high emissions in southern Beijing, central Tianjin and Tangshan) potentially indicate areas with robust emission estimates. This result could be useful in the efficient deployment of monitoring instruments, and if proven by such measurements, it will increase our confidence in inventories and provide support for policy makers trying to reduce emissions in key regions.

Five province-level pilot ETSs in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong and Hubei are assessed from the view of carbon emission efficiency analysis in this study. Firstly, both the environmental production technology and the Malmquist index are adopted to evaluate the carbon emission efficiency of 28 provinces in China. Then, the regression significance analysis of carbon emission efficiency and the operational information evaluation for pilot ETSs are combined to develop an integrated approach for assessing five considered pilot ETSs. The Efficiency analysis of carbon emissions indicate that the effect of ETS in Beijing is significant, the effect of ETS in Tianjin is weak significant, and those of the other three pilot ETSs are not significant. Based on the operational information for pilot ETSs, the evaluating results of pilot ETSs in Beijing and Hubei are better than those of other pilot ETSs. This study highlights two main findings. First, the pilot ETS in Beijing has better performance than the other considered pilot ETSs, and its operational experience should be promoted throughout the country to improve the construction of national carbon ETS. Second, the successful cooperation between the ETSs in Beijing and Tianjin implies that the regional cooperation among neighbouring ETSs should be encouraged and further implemented to enhance the overall performance of the regional ETSs.

The approach of this study consists of three steps that combine stock modeling, energy demand forecasting, and simulation of different energy technologies. First, a detailed residential building stock model for Herten is constructed by using remote sensing together with a typology for the German building stock. Second, a bottom-up simulation model is used which calculates the thermal energy demand based on energy-related investments in buildings in order to forecast the thermal demand up to 2050. Third, solar thermal fields in combination with large-scale heat pumps are sized as an alternative to the current coal-fired CHPs. We finally assess cost of heat and CO2 reduction for these units for two scenarios which differ with regard to the DH expansion. It can be concluded that up to 2030 and 2050 a substantial reduction in buildings heat demand due to the improved building insulation is expected. The falling heat demand in the DH substantially reduces the economic feasibility of new RES generation capacity. This reduction might be compensated by continuously connecting apartment buildings to the DH network until 2050.

The analysis results show that, with the advancement of environmental regulation, the dependence of China's economic growth on fossil energy has experienced a process from weak to strong and weak. There is a significant inverted U-shaped curve relationship between environmental regulation and CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions intensity. As the intensity of environmental regulation changes from weak to strong, the impact effect changes from Ã¢â‚¬Å“green paradoxÃ¢â‚¬Â effect to Ã¢â‚¬Å“back-forced reductionÃ¢â‚¬Â effect. The effect of environmental regulation in the eastern region is better than that in the central and western regions. However, with the implementation of environmental regulation, the inverted U-shaped curve between environmental regulation and carbon emissions gradually becomes flat. The results of the peak forecast show that China has crossed the peak of CO2 emissions intensity, but has not exceeded the peak of CO2 emissions. By further optimizing environmental regulations, China may reach its CO2 emissions peak by 2030. Overall, China's environmental regulations at the current stage can effectively curb carbon emissions and achieve the desired goals.

This voluntary RL submission has passed an official technical assessment process by the UNFCCC on the accordance of the data and method applied, which was finalised in December 2014.After years of international negotiations this has become possible by the REDD+ framework finally agreed. Although never formally adopted, the rules of procedure of the UNFCCC foresee consensus among the 196 parties to the convention. Due to the wide heterogeneity in national circumstances and capacities between these parties, the decided REDD+ framework represents a compromise, and in some points space for interpretation remains due to a lack of clear definitions. E.g., no internationally standardised method exists for the design of RLs under UNFCCC; rather each country has the possibility to apply its own approach within a given range of requirements. We argue that these nationally designed RLs involve the danger of raising a 'cherry-picking' mentality, which would reduce cost-efficiency of the payments. Especially in the light of the ongoing pressure to fight anthropogenic global climate change, the overall objective of REDD+ should be climate effectiveness. Therefore, apparently contradictory objectives-of integrating as many developing countries as possible, by keeping the barriers low, and of effective emission reductions by persisting on strict rules for national carbon accounting-had to be balanced.According to the technical assessment by the UNFCCC, the submitted Brazilian RL fulfils all formal requirements. However, as implication of the negotiated framework, there remain some questions on the climate effectiveness and the cost-efficiency of the submitted approach, which this viewpoint paper aims to critically reflect.Brazil chose for its present RL design the eligible options of a subnational coverage, with consideration of the activity of deforestation only. But only comprehensive accounting of all activities on national scale can ensure that all potential emissions are accounted for. By the present accounting gap, doubts on climate effectiveness arise. Furthermore, Brazil chose a fixed starting year for historic emissions and did not consider national circumstances, which results in reference emissions of about 1100 Mt CO2/a between 2006 and 2010. This potentially profitable RL setting for Brazil raises doubt on the cost-efficiency of the implied REDD+ payment.Whether these problems arising from the four eligible but critical RL options applied by Brazil emerge in other RLs as well, was checked for further five RL proposals submitted up to now. None of these country submissions has passed the technical assessment yet. The submitted approaches for RL design differ among the considered countries but one can see a tendency towards profitable individual RL definitions, similar to the Brazilian RL.From our findings we conclude that individually determined RLs without standardised methods bear the risk of national 'cherry-picking' which can compromise climate effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the whole REDD+ mechanism.

This in turn could lead to increased summertime overheating risk, with any active means for addressing this likely to influence future energy consumption and CO2 emission patterns. This paper examines how the microclimatic loading presented by the heat island (UHI) effect influences summertime adaptive comfort in traditional urban residential buildings. The method for addressing this utilises the novel approach of coupling a computationally efficient urban climate model with an established building energy model to simulate a residential street canyon within the London heat island. Key findings highlighted adaptive capabilities to achieve summertime 'comfort' in most rooms without the need for energy intensive mechanical cooling. The alternative of using indiscriminate and widespread mechanical cooling within the canyon length is estimated to result in a 0.4 K increase in nocturnal canyon temperatures, and an additional 4.4% of CO2 released to the climate. In contrast, a targeted approach of cooling rooms where adaptive capacity is insufficient more than halves the canyon CO2 emission estimate; which in turn highlights the necessity for detailed overheating assessments in managing energy use in such traditional residential neighbourhoods within UHIs.

The regulations do not make cost-effectiveness a primary criteria for choosing measures but cost remains important to a variety of stakeholders. This communication summarizes results from GHG and cost analysis for seven actual San Diego County road transportation policies: telecommute, vanpools, a bicycle strategy, an increase in mass transit use, parking policies (parking pricing, preferred parking for electric vehicles), an increased local fuel tax and speed harmonization (signal re-timing, roundabouts). Net costs are calculated as the sum of direct costs and benefits to the administering agency, the employer and the individual. Net costs per metric ton GHG abated vary greatly across measures, from negative to high positive (more than US $1000). We find that local GHG cost cannot be sensibly compared to other carbon or GHG policy costs outside the local context for a variety of reasons, but especially because measures have not been adopted primarily for carbon or GHG abatement potential or on the basis of cost effectiveness.

This approach has the potential to enable a rapid and effective inspection of O&amp;G facilities under voluntary or regulatory LDAR programs to identify and mitigate anomalously large CH4 emissions from a disproportionately small number of facilities. This is the first study of which the authors are aware to deploy, evaluate, and compare the CH4 detection volumes and cost-effectiveness of aerially guided and purely ground-based LDAR techniques. Two aerial methods, the Kairos Aerospace infrared CH4 column imaging and the Scientific Aviation in situ aircraft CH4 mole fraction measurements, were tested during a 2-week period in the Fayetteville Shale region contemporaneously with conventional ground-based LDAR. We show that aerially guided LDAR can be at least as cost-effective as ground-based LDAR, but several variable parameters were identified that strongly affect cost-effectiveness and which require field research and improvements beyond this pilot study. These parameters include (i) CH4 minimum dectectable limit of aerial technologies, (ii) emission rate size distributions of sources, (iii) remote distinction of fixable versus nonfixable CH4 sources (Ã¢â‚¬Å“leaksÃ¢â‚¬Â vs. CH4 emissions occurring by design), and (iv) the fraction of fixable sources to total CH4 emissions. Suggestions for future study design are provided. Implications: Mitigation of methane leaks from existing oil and gas operations currently relies on on-site inspections of all applicable facilities at a prescribed frequency. This approach is labor- and cost-intensive, especially because a majority of oil and gasÃ¢â‚¬â€œrelated methane emissions originate from a disproportionately small number of facilities and components. We show for the first time in real-world conditions how aerial methane measurements can identify anomalously high-emitting facilities to enable a rapid, focused, and directed ground inspection of these facilities. The aerially guided approach can be more cost-effective than current practices, especially when implementing the aircraft deployment improvements discussed here. Ã‚Â© 2019, Ã‚Â© 2019 The Author(s).
